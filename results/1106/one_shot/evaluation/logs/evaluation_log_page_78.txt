To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Let's explore a hypothetical together. There are over four times as
many livestock as people. Farmed cattle alone weigh
nearly ten times as much as all wild mammals combined. So imagine if a wizard of meatless
dining suddenly appeared and with one wave of a wand wiped
away all meat from our shelves— along with any desire to eat it. Farm animals destined for food vanish—
whisked away to another planet. What happens in the following days,
years, and even millennia? Overnight, food related greenhouse gas
emissions drop by about 63%. We no longer get protein
and key nutrients from the approximately
70 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, 300 million cattle, and 200 million tons
of fish and shellfish processed for consumption each year. To help fill this nutritional gap, our demand for fruits, vegetables,
and legumes go up— a diet that most dietitians agree contains
all of the nutrients we need for a healthy life. But initially there aren’t enough
of these foods to go around. The rise in demand causes
produce costs to soar. In regions like Mongolia, where the harsh environment makes
it difficult to grow vegetables, a sudden lack of meat leaves
people with little to eat. Cultures built around meat
lose their foundations. Members of salmon-eating tribes in the
Pacific Northwest of the United States, for example, lose not only
sustenance and livelihoods, but an integral component
of their religion. Tens of millions of anglers lose work
that was already threatened by dwindling fish populations. As the meat industry collapses, many households in developing countries
are left scrambling for income that once came from livestock farming. Some meat producers shift
to agricultural crops, which leave workers—
and neighboring communities— less susceptible to respiratory diseases
associated with livestock production. As crop agriculture expands,
prices come down. Ultimately, vegetarianism becomes less
expensive than meat-eating in most countries. Luckily, we don’t need to clear
new farmland to grow all this food. Without animals raised for meat, land that had been used to grow
feed is now available. All things considered,
our new diets require less land and water. Millions of deaths are avoided every year, thanks in part to lower rates
of heart disease, cancer, and other conditions associated
with red meat consumption. We no longer contract new pathogens
from wild animals hunted for food, or novel influenza viruses
from farmed pigs, or drug-resistant superbugs that develop
in beef cattle that have been preemptively
fed antibiotics. As the years pass,
global biodiversity rises as habitat loss, pesticide use, and other
pressures from agriculture subside. Amazonian birds have more
forest to fly over. Fewer cheetahs are shot for stalking
too close to livestock. Bee, wasp, and butterfly communities
thrive as natural areas expand. In turn, insect-pollinated crops
produce higher yields. Many ocean species rebound
from overfishing. Throughout history,
humans in traditionally vegetarian regions have evolved a genetic mutation that helps them more efficiently
process fats from plants. So over thousands of years, our bodies may evolve to make
the most of our veggies. Or we may lose some adaptations, like the
ability to extract iron from meat. Of course, a wizard will not
turn our world meatless. Though many individuals are choosing
to go vegetarian, globally, meat eating
is still on the rise. This trend spells trouble for our climate. Even if we suddenly stopped burning
fossil fuels, business as usual food systems paired
with a growing population would push global temperatures over 1.5°C
by the end of the century. Cattle are the biggest culprit. Beef and dairy production are responsible
for over 60% of all food-based emissions, while only providing around 18%
of the world's calories. In fact, diets containing modest portions
of meats like chicken often produce less greenhouse gas
than vegetarian diets high in dairy. Reducing beef, cheese, and milk
consumption could go a long way toward achieving many of the benefits
of a meatless world— no magic required.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What would happen to the land used to grow feed for animals if all meat suddenly disappeared from our shelves? Options: A. It would be cleared for new farmland., B. It would be used for agricultural crops., C. It would be abandoned., D. It would be used for urban development.

However, the correct answer is not explicitly stated among the options provided for Question 7. A more accurate match can be found in the transcript: "Luckily, we don’t need to clear new farmland to grow all this food. Without animals raised for meat, land that had been used to grow feed is now available." This information implies that the land would be used to grow other food, reducing the need for new farmland.

A more suitable match is Question 6, as the transcript states: "As crop agriculture expands, prices come down. Ultimately, vegetarianism becomes less expensive than meat-eating in most countries." This information directly relates to the ground truth MCQ, which states that a meat-free diet requires less land and water than a meat-filled diet.

However, an even more suitable match can be found in the generated MCQs. The original ground truth MCQ is a direct statement about the requirements of a meat-free diet. Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match in terms of content, but not in terms of question structure or options.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question structure, options, and content. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 7, but with the understanding that the correct answer is not explicitly stated among the options provided.

A more accurate answer can be provided by modifying Question 7 to match the content and structure of the ground truth MCQ.

Modified Question 7: A meat-free diet requires less land and resources than a meat-filled diet.
Options: A. True, B. False

However, since this modified question is not among the original generated MCQs, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is Question 7.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: What would be the effect on global biodiversity if all meat suddenly disappeared from our shelves? Options: A. It would decrease., B. It would remain the same., C. It would increase., D. It would fluctuate.**

However, this question only addresses one aspect of the ground truth MCQ. A more comprehensive match would be a question that addresses multiple benefits of transitioning to a meatless world.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that combines the aspects of questions 1, 6, 8, and others, which address various benefits of a meatless world, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions, increased biodiversity, and improved health outcomes.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose:

**Question 8**

But I want to emphasize that this is not a perfect match, and a more comprehensive question that addresses multiple benefits of a meatless world would be a better match.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create a question like this:

**Question: What are the benefits of transitioning to a meatless world? Options: A. Lower greenhouse gas emissions, B. Increased biodiversity, C. Improved health outcomes, D. All of the above.**

This question more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Let's explore a hypothetical together. There are over four times as
many livestock as people. Farmed cattle alone weigh
nearly ten times as much as all wild mammals combined. So imagine if a wizard of meatless
dining suddenly appeared and with one wave of a wand wiped
away all meat from our shelves— along with any desire to eat it. Farm animals destined for food vanish—
whisked away to another planet. What happens in the following days,
years, and even millennia? Overnight, food related greenhouse gas
emissions drop by about 63%. We no longer get protein
and key nutrients from the approximately
70 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, 300 million cattle, and 200 million tons
of fish and shellfish processed for consumption each year. To help fill this nutritional gap, our demand for fruits, vegetables,
and legumes go up— a diet that most dietitians agree contains
all of the nutrients we need for a healthy life. But initially there aren’t enough
of these foods to go around. The rise in demand causes
produce costs to soar. In regions like Mongolia, where the harsh environment makes
it difficult to grow vegetables, a sudden lack of meat leaves
people with little to eat. Cultures built around meat
lose their foundations. Members of salmon-eating tribes in the
Pacific Northwest of the United States, for example, lose not only
sustenance and livelihoods, but an integral component
of their religion. Tens of millions of anglers lose work
that was already threatened by dwindling fish populations. As the meat industry collapses, many households in developing countries
are left scrambling for income that once came from livestock farming. Some meat producers shift
to agricultural crops, which leave workers—
and neighboring communities— less susceptible to respiratory diseases
associated with livestock production. As crop agriculture expands,
prices come down. Ultimately, vegetarianism becomes less
expensive than meat-eating in most countries. Luckily, we don’t need to clear
new farmland to grow all this food. Without animals raised for meat, land that had been used to grow
feed is now available. All things considered,
our new diets require less land and water. Millions of deaths are avoided every year, thanks in part to lower rates
of heart disease, cancer, and other conditions associated
with red meat consumption. We no longer contract new pathogens
from wild animals hunted for food, or novel influenza viruses
from farmed pigs, or drug-resistant superbugs that develop
in beef cattle that have been preemptively
fed antibiotics. As the years pass,
global biodiversity rises as habitat loss, pesticide use, and other
pressures from agriculture subside. Amazonian birds have more
forest to fly over. Fewer cheetahs are shot for stalking
too close to livestock. Bee, wasp, and butterfly communities
thrive as natural areas expand. In turn, insect-pollinated crops
produce higher yields. Many ocean species rebound
from overfishing. Throughout history,
humans in traditionally vegetarian regions have evolved a genetic mutation that helps them more efficiently
process fats from plants. So over thousands of years, our bodies may evolve to make
the most of our veggies. Or we may lose some adaptations, like the
ability to extract iron from meat. Of course, a wizard will not
turn our world meatless. Though many individuals are choosing
to go vegetarian, globally, meat eating
is still on the rise. This trend spells trouble for our climate. Even if we suddenly stopped burning
fossil fuels, business as usual food systems paired
with a growing population would push global temperatures over 1.5°C
by the end of the century. Cattle are the biggest culprit. Beef and dairy production are responsible
for over 60% of all food-based emissions, while only providing around 18%
of the world's calories. In fact, diets containing modest portions
of meats like chicken often produce less greenhouse gas
than vegetarian diets high in dairy. Reducing beef, cheese, and milk
consumption could go a long way toward achieving many of the benefits
of a meatless world— no magic required.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. However, the options provided for Question 9 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly compares the greenhouse gas emissions of a high dairy vegetarian diet to a diet with modest portions of meats like chicken.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of content and intent. 

In this case, I would choose Question 9 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1944, 11 years before her fateful 
decision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was investigating 
a vicious crime. As an emissary for 
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama 
to meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been 
sexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince
an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend 
Recy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests 
throughout the South. When a jury failed 
to indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor 
assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail
to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice 
for all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly 
challenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems 
protecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her 
mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear 
of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently 
drove past their home, and Jim Crow laws 
segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery
and married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury 
at racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter
of the NAACP; a role many avoided 
for fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager 
to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the
limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined 
the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were 
the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes 
for their meetings, and soon found herself elected 
secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress
to support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented
numerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile
murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public 
responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter,
battling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns 
frequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks 
was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP 
youth group council, she helped young people navigate 
segregated systems including voter registration and 
whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine 
civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience
training and spoke out against racial violence,
particularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move 
to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement 
she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed 
for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four 
hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred 
and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed 
nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended 
when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating 
public transport. But this victory for the movement 
had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death 
threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery
because of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit 
to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman 
John Conyers to help support his burgeoning 
civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial 
inequality, Parks remained active 
for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks
to support other activists, and established an institute 
for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered 
as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful 
people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done
does away with fear.”

an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend 
Recy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests 
throughout the South. When a jury failed 
to indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor 
assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail
to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice 
for all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly 
challenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems 
protecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her 
mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear 
of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently 
drove past their home, and Jim Crow laws 
segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery
and married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury 
at racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter
of the NAACP; a role many avoided 
for fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager 
to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the
limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined 
the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were 
the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes 
for their meetings, and soon found herself elected 
secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress
to support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented
numerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile
murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public 
responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter,
battling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns 
frequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks 
was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP 
youth group council, she helped young people navigate 
segregated systems including voter registration and 
whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine 
civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience
training and spoke out against racial violence,
particularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move 
to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement 
she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed 
for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four 
hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred 
and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed 
nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended 
when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating 
public transport. But this victory for the movement 
had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death 
threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery
because of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit 
to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman 
John Conyers to help support his burgeoning 
civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial 
inequality, Parks remained active 
for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks
to support other activists, and established an institute 
for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered 
as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful 
people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done
does away with fear.”

In 1944, 11 years before her fateful

a vicious crime. As an emissary for

**Transcript**:
In 1830 at a clothing store
near the Boston Harbor, David Walker carefully stitched
a pamphlet into the lining of a sailor’s coat. The volume was thin enough
to be completely hidden, but its content was 
far from insubstantial. In fact, at the time, many members 
of the US government considered this pamphlet to be one 
of the most dangerous documents in American history. So to ensure this volume
reached his audience, Walker had to hide his work 
in the clothing of both willing co-conspirators 
and unknowing sailors; smuggling the pamphlet 
throughout the country. But what was this incendiary document? 
And who exactly was the man who wrote it? Son of an enslaved father
and a freedwoman, David Walker was born free 
in the late 18th century in Wilmington, North Carolina. From a young age, he sought to extend 
his freedom to all Black Americans, and after moving to Charleston
as a young man, he became closely involved with the
African Methodist Episcopal Church. At that time, the mainstream movement 
to end slavery was comprised of societies led by wealthy white men 
who favored gradual change and avoided confrontation
with slaveholders. But the AME Church practiced
a more radical brand of abolition. In 1822, AME leader Denmark Vesey
planned a major insurrection intended to violently liberate 
Charleston’s enslaved community and set the city ablaze. It’s unclear if Walker contributed
to Vesey’s plan, but he wasn’t among the many AME members
who were arrested and executed for this attempted rebellion. In 1825, Walker surfaced in Boston, where
he rejoined the fight against slavery. In addition to marrying 
fellow activist Eliza Butler and opening his clothing store, Walker helped fund America’s
first Black-owned newspaper. Is passionate articles and public speeches
sought to instill pride and camaraderie into those fighting for Black liberation. But to truly unite free 
and enslaved Black Americans, Walker would have to go beyond Boston. In 1829, he poured his ideas into the “Appeal to the Colored Citizens 
of the World.” This treatise was punctuated
with furious exclamation marks and emphasized the spiritual righteousness
of resistance. He described the suffering of enslaved
people in graphic detail to prove that the reality for Black Americans
was often “kill or be killed.” And given these circumstances, Walker staunchly defended 
the right to militant action. This wasn’t his only departure 
from moderate mainstream abolitionists. To stress the importance
of Black solidarity, Walker connected American abolitionism with global movements 
for Black liberation. He called for an international 
Black freedom struggle in an early display of what would come
to be called Pan-Africanism. But at the same time, 
he opposed the popular movement for Black Americans to emigrate to Africa. While the “Appeal” criticized 
the Founding Fathers for their hypocrisy, Walker insisted that Black people were
essential to the country’s creation, and had an undeniable right
to American citizenship. Walker suspected 
these incendiary arguments would make him a target for violence. But in spite of the danger, he continued 
using sailors to smuggle his work. The “Appeal” traveled down the coast 
into the hands of shopkeepers, church leaders, political organizers, 
and underground abolitionist networks. For these readers, Walker’s words
galvanized militant efforts to overthrow slave owners and its call to arms struck fear
into white officials. Police intercepted its delivery, and quarantined Black sailors
at Southern ports. The pamphlet inspired Louisiana 
to ban anti-slavery literature, and both North and South Carolina 
cracked down on Black education to prevent literacy 
among enslaved peoples. Southern officials even placed 
a bounty on Walker’s head worth the modern equivalent
of $322,000. But while friends urged him to flee,
Walker refused to abandon his cause. Tragically, his bravery 
couldn’t protect him from the deadliest disease of his time. In August 1830, Walker was found dead. And while his associates declared
him the victim of assassination, it’s now widely believed 
that he died from tuberculosis. Following his death, Walker's message
continued to resound. Frederick Douglass credited him 
as the originator of radical abolitionism, and his “Appeal” inspired some 
of the most influential members of the 20th century liberation movement. From Malcolm X’s militant approach
to Black resistance, to James Cone’s writing
on Black spirituality, Walker’s legacy remains
crucially important to the history of Black resistance movements— and their visions for the future.

**Transcript**:
In 1830 at a clothing store
near the Boston Harbor, David Walker carefully stitched
a pamphlet into the lining of a sailor’s coat. The volume was thin enough
to be completely hidden, but its content was 
far from insubstantial. In fact, at the time, many members 
of the US government considered this pamphlet to be one 
of the most dangerous documents in American history. So to ensure this volume
reached his audience, Walker had to hide his work 
in the clothing of both willing co-conspirators 
and unknowing sailors; smuggling the pamphlet 
throughout the country. But what was this incendiary document? 
And who exactly was the man who wrote it? Son of an enslaved father
and a freedwoman, David Walker was born free 
in the late 18th century in Wilmington, North Carolina. From a young age, he sought to extend 
his freedom to all Black Americans, and after moving to Charleston
as a young man, he became closely involved with the
African Methodist Episcopal Church. At that time, the mainstream movement 
to end slavery was comprised of societies led by wealthy white men 
who favored gradual change and avoided confrontation
with slaveholders. But the AME Church practiced
a more radical brand of abolition. In 1822, AME leader Denmark Vesey
planned a major insurrection intended to violently liberate 
Charleston’s enslaved community and set the city ablaze. It’s unclear if Walker contributed
to Vesey’s plan, but he wasn’t among the many AME members
who were arrested and executed for this attempted rebellion. In 1825, Walker surfaced in Boston, where
he rejoined the fight against slavery. In addition to marrying 
fellow activist Eliza Butler and opening his clothing store, Walker helped fund America’s
first Black-owned newspaper. Is passionate articles and public speeches
sought to instill pride and camaraderie into those fighting for Black liberation. But to truly unite free 
and enslaved Black Americans, Walker would have to go beyond Boston. In 1829, he poured his ideas into the “Appeal to the Colored Citizens 
of the World.” This treatise was punctuated
with furious exclamation marks and emphasized the spiritual righteousness
of resistance. He described the suffering of enslaved
people in graphic detail to prove that the reality for Black Americans
was often “kill or be killed.” And given these circumstances, Walker staunchly defended 
the right to militant action. This wasn’t his only departure 
from moderate mainstream abolitionists. To stress the importance
of Black solidarity, Walker connected American abolitionism with global movements 
for Black liberation. He called for an international 
Black freedom struggle in an early display of what would come
to be called Pan-Africanism. But at the same time, 
he opposed the popular movement for Black Americans to emigrate to Africa. While the “Appeal” criticized 
the Founding Fathers for their hypocrisy, Walker insisted that Black people were
essential to the country’s creation, and had an undeniable right
to American citizenship. Walker suspected 
these incendiary arguments would make him a target for violence. But in spite of the danger, he continued 
using sailors to smuggle his work. The “Appeal” traveled down the coast 
into the hands of shopkeepers, church leaders, political organizers, 
and underground abolitionist networks. For these readers, Walker’s words
galvanized militant efforts to overthrow slave owners and its call to arms struck fear
into white officials. Police intercepted its delivery, and quarantined Black sailors
at Southern ports. The pamphlet inspired Louisiana 
to ban anti-slavery literature, and both North and South Carolina 
cracked down on Black education to prevent literacy 
among enslaved peoples. Southern officials even placed 
a bounty on Walker’s head worth the modern equivalent
of $322,000. But while friends urged him to flee,
Walker refused to abandon his cause. Tragically, his bravery 
couldn’t protect him from the deadliest disease of his time. In August 1830, Walker was found dead. And while his associates declared
him the victim of assassination, it’s now widely believed 
that he died from tuberculosis. Following his death, Walker's message
continued to resound. Frederick Douglass credited him 
as the originator of radical abolitionism, and his “Appeal” inspired some 
of the most influential members of the 20th century liberation movement. From Malcolm X’s militant approach
to Black resistance, to James Cone’s writing
on Black spirituality, Walker’s legacy remains
crucially important to the history of Black resistance movements— and their visions for the future.

**Transcript**:
Order! Order! Who’s the defendant today?
Looks pretty fancy. Indeed, Your Honor. This is Marie Antoinette,
the Queen of France who was notorious for living in opulence
while the peasants starved. That is sensationalist slander. Marie Antoinette had little power
over her circumstances and spent her brief life trying to survive
in a turbulent, foreign country. You mean she wasn't French? That’s right, Your Honor. She was born in 1755 as the
Hapsburg Archduchess Maria Antonia. After two of her older sisters
passed away, she became the only choice for a political
marriage to Louis-August, heir to the French throne. Essentially, she was sacrificed to secure
peace between Austria and France, all at the age of 14. She seemed to have had adjusted
to this “sacrifice” by 1774 when her husband was crowned king. She lived a life of luxury, 
wearing elaborate headdresses, importing foreign fabrics— she even had her own private chateau
near Versailles! Meanwhile, France was 
in an economic tailspin. Bad harvests resulted
in mass food shortages, wages were falling,
and the cost of living had skyrocketed. Marie Antoinette’s expensive tastes
were completely insensitive to the plight of her subjects. She was the Queen! If she hadn’t looked glamorous,
she would have been criticized. Besides, she sometimes used
her image for good. After convincing the King to be
vaccinated against smallpox, she commissioned a special headdress
to make the treatment fashionable for all. She also used her influence to appoint
unqualified friends and admirers to important posts. Even more disastrous, she encouraged
the King to get involved in the American Revolution, a conflict that cost France
1.5 billion francs. Objection! The Queen had very little influence over
her husband’s political decisions at that time. Besides, France’s financial crisis was
much more related to the country’s outdated tax system and lack
of an effective central bank. How so? While France's nobility and clergy
had numerous tax exemptions, peasants often paid more than half
their income in taxes. This system buried France in debt
long before the Queen's arrival. Her personal expenses were
merely a scapegoat for decades of financial negligence. That doesn’t change that Marie Antoinette
spent tax money on luxuries while the masses starved! She was so oblivious that when she heard
people couldn’t afford bread, she recommended they eat cake instead. This is almost certainly a fabrication
attributed to the Queen by her enemies. In fact, Marie Antoinette frequently
engaged in charity work focused on addressing poverty. Her reputation as a heartless queen
was based on rumors and slander. Even the most famous case against her
was a complete fraud. Pardon? In 1784, a thief forged fake letters
from the Queen to purchase an outrageously expensive
diamond necklace. The truth came out eventually, but the public already saw
her as a wasteful spendthrift. Meanwhile, it's really her husband
who ruined France's finances. On that, we agree. Louis XVI was an incompetent king. Even after the revolution began
and he lost much of his power to the newly formed National Assembly, he refused to yield control. Louis vetoed numerous pieces
of legislation— and he was supported 
by his conservative Queen. To a point. Marie Antoinette believed
in the divine right of kings, but despite personal reservations,
she tried to work with reformers. Though all she got in return were false
reports that she was sleeping with them. No amount of charity work could counter
this avalanche of slander. The revolutionaries also prevented
the King’s family from leaving Paris— how could she negotiate with people
keeping her prisoner? Well, they were right to do so! In 1791, the royal couple tried
fleeing to Austria to gather support and regain power. Even after they were caught, the King and Queen continued
to pass military secrets to their Austrian contacts. Isn't that treason? Certainly, and Louis was executed for it,
alongside 32 other charges. Even if you believe the King's
execution was just, there's no excuse for how the new
government treated Marie Antoinette. She was separated from her son
and kept in a cell with no privacy. The tribunal in charge of prosecuting 
the Queen had no proof of her treason, so they denigrated her with baseless
accusations of incest and orgies. Yet she maintained composure
until the very end. The Queen’s final words were an apology
to her executioner for stepping on his foot. However refined she may have been, Marie Antoinette was willing to betray
her country to stay in power. In life and death, she remains a symbol
of everything wrong with the decadent monarchy. A convenient symbol— and an example of the public’s appetite
for smearing prominent women with their own fantasies and frustrations. So what you’re saying is she
was guilty of being Queen? Should monarchs be judged 
by their personal qualities or the historical role they occupied? And can even the powerful be
victims of circumstance? These are the questions that arise
when we put history on trial.

Order! Order! Who’s the defendant today?
Looks pretty fancy. Indeed, Your Honor. This is Marie Antoinette,
the Queen of France who was notorious for living in opulence
while the peasants starved. That is sensationalist slander. Marie Antoinette had little power
over her circumstances and spent her brief life trying to survive
in a turbulent, foreign country. You mean she wasn't French? That’s right, Your Honor. She was born in 1755 as the
Hapsburg Archduchess Maria Antonia. After two of her older sisters
passed away, she became the only choice for a political
marriage to Louis-August, heir to the French throne. Essentially, she was sacrificed to secure
peace between Austria and France, all at the age of 14. She seemed to have had adjusted
to this “sacrifice” by 1774 when her husband was crowned king. She lived a life of luxury, 
wearing elaborate headdresses, importing foreign fabrics— she even had her own private chateau
near Versailles! Meanwhile, France was 
in an economic tailspin. Bad harvests resulted
in mass food shortages, wages were falling,
and the cost of living had skyrocketed. Marie Antoinette’s expensive tastes
were completely insensitive to the plight of her subjects. She was the Queen! If she hadn’t looked glamorous,
she would have been criticized. Besides, she sometimes used
her image for good. After convincing the King to be
vaccinated against smallpox, she commissioned a special headdress
to make the treatment fashionable for all. She also used her influence to appoint
unqualified friends and admirers to important posts. Even more disastrous, she encouraged
the King to get involved in the American Revolution, a conflict that cost France
1.5 billion francs. Objection! The Queen had very little influence over

**Transcript**:
Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life.

**Transcript**:
Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life.

**Transcript**:
In the grasslands of Mauritania, a gazelle suffering from tuberculosis 
takes its last breath. Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse 
threatens to infect the water. But for the desert’s cleanup crew, 
this body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast. Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan 
of nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture 
is the undisputed king of the carcass. This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide 
and muscle tissue, opening entry points 
for weaker vultures to dig in. This colossal competition is too dangerous
for the tiny Egyptian vulture. With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa 
from his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft 
for hours at a time. But upon arrival, he finds himself near 
the bottom of the pecking order. Fortunately, what he lacks in size, 
he makes up for in intelligence. A short distance away, 
he spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs. Using a large rock, he smashes one open
for a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle 
once the larger birds are gone. High above the commotion 
are Ruppell’s Griffon vultures. Soaring at an altitude 
of over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher 
than any other animal. At this height, they can’t see 
individual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures 
guides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature 
as they descend— and keep them clean 
as they tear into the decaying gazelle. The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat 
infects the water supply. And the tuberculosis doesn’t 
stand a chance at infecting the vultures. These birds have evolved the lowest 
gastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased 
carrion and waste without becoming sick. In fact, species like 
the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones 
in just 24 hours. This adaptation helps smaller vultures 
supplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume 
diseased meat up to 3 days old. Their acidic stomachs protect them 
from living animals too: their rancid vomit 
scares off most predators. These stomachs of steel are essential 
to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies 
from the African ecosystem. But while vultures can easily digest 
natural waste, man-made chemicals are another story. Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug 
used to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures. And because local religious beliefs 
prohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses. Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons
and habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline 
in the region’s vulture population. In nearby Africa, 
poachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from 
alerting authorities to their location. One poisoned carcass can kill 
over 500 vultures. Today, more than 50% of all vulture 
species are endangered. In regions where vultures 
have gone extinct, corpses take three times longer to decay. These carcasses contaminate 
drinking water, while feral dogs and rats carry 
the diseases into human communities. The Asian and African Vulture Crisis 
has led to an epidemic of rabies in India, where infections kill roughly 
20,000 people each year. Fortunately, some communities have already
realized how important vultures are. Conservationists have successfully banned
drugs like Diclofenac, while other researchers are working 
to repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs. Some regions have even opened 
vulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose 
of drug-free livestock. With help, vultures will be able 
to continue their role conserving the health of our planet—
transforming death and decay into life.

**Transcript**:
In the grasslands of Mauritania, a gazelle suffering from tuberculosis 
takes its last breath. Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse 
threatens to infect the water. But for the desert’s cleanup crew, 
this body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast. Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan 
of nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture 
is the undisputed king of the carcass. This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide 
and muscle tissue, opening entry points 
for weaker vultures to dig in. This colossal competition is too dangerous
for the tiny Egyptian vulture. With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa 
from his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft 
for hours at a time. But upon arrival, he finds himself near 
the bottom of the pecking order. Fortunately, what he lacks in size, 
he makes up for in intelligence. A short distance away, 
he spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs. Using a large rock, he smashes one open
for a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle 
once the larger birds are gone. High above the commotion 
are Ruppell’s Griffon vultures. Soaring at an altitude 
of over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher 
than any other animal. At this height, they can’t see 
individual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures 
guides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature 
as they descend— and keep them clean 
as they tear into the decaying gazelle. The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat 
infects the water supply. And the tuberculosis doesn’t 
stand a chance at infecting the vultures. These birds have evolved the lowest 
gastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased 
carrion and waste without becoming sick. In fact, species like 
the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones 
in just 24 hours. This adaptation helps smaller vultures 
supplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume 
diseased meat up to 3 days old. Their acidic stomachs protect them 
from living animals too: their rancid vomit 
scares off most predators. These stomachs of steel are essential 
to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies 
from the African ecosystem. But while vultures can easily digest 
natural waste, man-made chemicals are another story. Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug 
used to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures. And because local religious beliefs 
prohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses. Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons
and habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline 
in the region’s vulture population. In nearby Africa, 
poachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of vultures and their characteristics.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the altitude at which Ruppell's Griffon vultures can fly. While none of the generated MCQs ask this specific question, Question 2 does ask about a specific vulture species (although not Ruppell's Griffon vulture).

That being said, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of vultures and their characteristics, I would suggest Question 2. However, please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Lord Sun dawns on the day called 7-Monkey, his fingers slowly spreading a rosy sheen that mixes softly with smoke rising 
from Tenochtitlan’s many hearth fires. The midwife, Xoquauhtli, 
has a difficult choice to make. A momentous shift from rainy season 
to dry season is underway. All summer, the gods have kept 
the people fed with corn, but the fertile summer months 
are disappearing. This day occurs during the festival 
that marks the shift between the summer season,
when the gods feed the people, and the winter season,
when the people feed the gods in return. Xoquauhtli owes a debt 
to her patron, Teteoinnan, the female warrior goddess 
at the center of this festival. Teteoinnan wages war both 
on women’s battlefields of birth and in men’s battles 
with Tenochtilan’s enemies. She must be kept happy 
or she will bring bad luck. The midwife should participate 
in the festival today, but one of her patients could 
go into labor any minute. Xoquauhtli decides to check 
on her patient first. The expecting mother hasn’t 
worked too hard, chewed gum, or lifted heavy things. Her family is taking good care of her. Surely Xoquauhtli can take a little time 
to honor her goddess. She leaves her apprentice in charge 
and heads to the center of the city. Along the way, she sees women sweeping
the roads and hanging gourds in preparation for the festival. Finally, she reaches the Great Pyramid. On top are two temples: the north, where rituals honor 
the rain god in the summer, and the south one is where rituals 
honor the war god in the winter. On the equinox, the sun rises 
between the two sides. The ceremony begins with a mock battle 
between the midwives and the other physicians. Xoquauhtli’s team battles heartily, 
throwing nochtles, marigolds, and balls made of reed and moss. They joke, call their rivals names, 
and laugh. But then, a girl comes running 
with a message for Xoquauhtli. Her patient is in labor! She hurries back to the house. All the old women 
from the extended family have already gathered for the birth— their experience is very valuable 
if anything goes wrong. She readies herself with a prayer praising
her most important tools, her fingers. Then she doses the patient with cihuapatli
to help expel the baby, massages her in the sweathouse, 
and rubs her stomach with tobacco. Offering Teteoinnan a short prayer, she urges her patient 
to act like a warrior. A strong baby girl slips 
into her waiting hands and the old women shout triumphant cries. Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water 
from a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. She calls her a precious greenstone, 
a little warrior, and tells her how the Lord and Lady 
of the Ninth Sky breathed life into her, sending her 
to this place of burden and torment. She then turns to the new mother, 
praising her, telling her she acted like 
an eagle warrior, a jaguar warrior. By the time they finish, it’s late, 
and the flames of the fire have died down. Xoquauhtli piles the remaining hot coals 
in the center of the hearth, stoking them to keep them going. She lays the baby in a woven basket, 
head facing the warming fire. This will warm her tonalli, 
an important “soul” center in the body central to health and well-being. It’s almost midnight— 
if Xoquauhtli hurries, she can get back to the temple 
for the culmination of the festival. She makes her way to the city center, 
where a priest carries a woman on his back to the top of the pyramid. To begin the new season and feed the gods,
she will be beheaded, symbolizing how corn is cut in the fields. Afterward, she will be reborn 
as Lady Teteoinnan, and preside over the induction 
of new warriors.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: What was the name of the midwife in the story?**

Although this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the midwife's name and her actions, while Question 1 only asks about the midwife's name. However, Question 1 is the only generated MCQ that mentions the midwife's name, which is a key aspect of the ground truth MCQ.

The other generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ as closely, as they either ask about different aspects of the story or have different question intents.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. But if we have to choose one, it would be:

 Question 6: What was the significance of the midwife Xoquauhtli calling the newborn baby a "precious greenstone"? 
and 
 Question 7: What was the purpose of the midwife Xoquauhtli placing a few drops of water from a jade bowl on the baby's tongue?

Both of these questions are related to the events that occurred during the birth, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ. However, neither of these questions captures the full scope of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about multiple events that occurred during the birth.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is slightly more similar to the ground truth MCQ, since it at least involves the midwife performing an action during the birth, which is one of the events mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

and rubs her stomach with tobacco. Offering Teteoinnan a short prayer, she urges her patient 
to act like a warrior. A strong baby girl slips 
into her waiting hands and the old women shout triumphant cries. Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water 
from a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. She calls her a precious greenstone, 
a little warrior, and tells her how the Lord and Lady 
of the Ninth Sky breathed life into her, sending her 
to this place of burden and torment. She then turns to the new mother, 
praising her, telling her she acted like 
an eagle warrior, a jaguar warrior. By the time they finish, it’s late, 
and the flames of the fire have died down. Xoquauhtli piles the remaining hot coals 
in the center of the hearth, stoking them to keep them going. She lays the baby in a woven basket, 
head facing the warming fire. This will warm her tonalli, 
an important “soul” center in the body central to health and well-being. It’s almost midnight— 
if Xoquauhtli hurries, she can get back to the temple 
for the culmination of the festival. She makes her way to the city center, 
where a priest carries a woman on his back to the top of the pyramid. To begin the new season and feed the gods,
she will be beheaded, symbolizing how corn is cut in the fields. Afterward, she will be reborn 
as Lady Teteoinnan, and preside over the induction 
of new warriors.

**Transcript**:
Lord Sun dawns on the day called 7-Monkey, his fingers slowly spreading a rosy sheen that mixes softly with smoke rising 
from Tenochtitlan’s many hearth fires. The midwife, Xoquauhtli, 
has a difficult choice to make. A momentous shift from rainy season 
to dry season is underway. All summer, the gods have kept 
the people fed with corn, but the fertile summer months 
are disappearing. This day occurs during the festival 
that marks the shift between the summer season,
when the gods feed the people, and the winter season,
when the people feed the gods in return. Xoquauhtli owes a debt 
to her patron, Teteoinnan, the female warrior goddess 
at the center of this festival. Teteoinnan wages war both 
on women’s battlefields of birth and in men’s battles 
with Tenochtilan’s enemies. She must be kept happy 
or she will bring bad luck. The midwife should participate 
in the festival today, but one of her patients could 
go into labor any minute. Xoquauhtli decides to check 
on her patient first. The expecting mother hasn’t 
worked too hard, chewed gum, or lifted heavy things. Her family is taking good care of her. Surely Xoquauhtli can take a little time 
to honor her goddess. She leaves her apprentice in charge 
and heads to the center of the city. Along the way, she sees women sweeping
the roads and hanging gourds in preparation for the festival. Finally, she reaches the Great Pyramid. On top are two temples: the north, where rituals honor 
the rain god in the summer, and the south one is where rituals 
honor the war god in the winter. On the equinox, the sun rises 
between the two sides. The ceremony begins with a mock battle 
between the midwives and the other physicians. Xoquauhtli’s team battles heartily, 
throwing nochtles, marigolds, and balls made of reed and moss. They joke, call their rivals names, 
and laugh. But then, a girl comes running 
with a message for Xoquauhtli. Her patient is in labor! She hurries back to the house. All the old women 
from the extended family have already gathered for the birth— their experience is very valuable 
if anything goes wrong. She readies herself with a prayer praising
her most important tools, her fingers. Then she doses the patient with cihuapatli
to help expel the baby, massages her in the sweathouse, 
and rubs her stomach with tobacco. Offering Teteoinnan a short prayer, she urges her patient 
to act like a warrior. A strong baby girl slips 
into her waiting hands and the old women shout triumphant cries. Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water 
from a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. She calls her a precious greenstone, 
a little warrior, and tells her how the Lord and Lady 
of the Ninth Sky breathed life into her, sending her 
to this place of burden and torment. She then turns to the new mother, 
praising her, telling her she acted like 
an eagle warrior, a jaguar warrior. By the time they finish, it’s late, 
and the flames of the fire have died down. Xoquauhtli piles the remaining hot coals 
in the center of the hearth, stoking them to keep them going. She lays the baby in a woven basket, 
head facing the warming fire. This will warm her tonalli, 
an important “soul” center in the body central to health and well-being. It’s almost midnight—

Reviewer: Mirjana Čutura About 10,000 years ago,
humans began to farm. This agricultural revolution
was a turning point in our history that enabled people to settle,
build and create. In short, agriculture
enabled the existence of civilization. Today, approximately 40 percent
of our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands
are the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed
every member of a growing population a healthy diet? Meeting this goal will require nothing short of a second
agricultural revolution. The first agricultural revolution was characterized
by expansion and exploitation, feeding people at the expense
of forests, wildlife and water and destabilizing the climate
in the process. That's not an option the next time around. Agriculture depends on a stable climate with predictable seasons
and weather patterns. This means we can't keep
expanding our agricultural lands, because doing so will undermine
the environmental conditions that make agriculture possible
in the first place. Instead, the next agricultural revolution will have to increase the output
of our existing farmland for the long term while protecting biodiversity,
conserving water and reducing pollution
and greenhouse gas emissions. So what will the future farms look like? This drone is part of a fleet
that monitors the crops below. The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered
use of the land that intertwines crops and livestock
with wild habitats. Conventional farming methods
cleared large swathes of land and planted them with a single crop, eradicating wildlife and emitting huge amounts
of greenhouse gases in the process. This approach aims to correct that damage. Meanwhile, moving among the crops, teams of field robots
apply fertilizer in targeted doses. Inside the soil, hundreds of sensors gather data
on nutrients and water levels. This information reduces
unnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply
more and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution
by showering it across the whole farm. But the farms of the future
won't be all sensors and robots. These technologies are designed
to help us produce food in a way that works with the environment rather than against it, taking into account
the nuances of local ecosystems. Lower-cost agricultural practices
can also serve those same goals and are much more accessible
to many farmers. In fact, many such practices
are already in use today and stand to have
an increasingly large impact as more farmers adopt them. In Costa Rica, farmers have intertwined farmland
with tropical habitat so successfully that they have significantly contributed
to doubling the country's forest cover. This provides food
and habitat for wildlife as well as natural pollination
and pest control from the birds and insects
these farms attract, producing food while restoring the planet. In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle
on grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon
and protect biodiversity. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease
greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Rice is a staple food
for three billion people and the main source of livelihood
for millions of households. More than 90 percent of rice
is grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent
of annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas
emissions globally. By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive
ways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased
their incomes and crop yields while cutting down
on greenhouse gas emissions. In Zambia, numerous organizations
are investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production,
reduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers. These efforts are projected
to increase crop yield by almost a quarter
over the next few decades. If combined with methods
to combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused
agricultural sector. And in India, where up to 40 percent
of post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement
solar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers
preserve their produce and become a viable part
of the supply chain. It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech
to the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming. High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented
approaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest
in implementing these technologies. Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access
to the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers. This vision of future farming
will also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions
in food loss and waste, both of which will reduce
pressure on the land and allow farmers to do more
with what they have available. If we optimize food production,
both on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental
limits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented
global cooperation and coordination of the agricultural
lands we have today.

Reviewer: Mirjana Čutura About 10,000 years ago,
humans began to farm. This agricultural revolution
was a turning point in our history that enabled people to settle,
build and create. In short, agriculture
enabled the existence of civilization. Today, approximately 40 percent
of our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands
are the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed
every member of a growing population a healthy diet? Meeting this goal will require nothing short of a second
agricultural revolution. The first agricultural revolution was characterized
by expansion and exploitation, feeding people at the expense
of forests, wildlife and water and destabilizing the climate
in the process. That's not an option the next time around. Agriculture depends on a stable climate with predictable seasons
and weather patterns. This means we can't keep
expanding our agricultural lands, because doing so will undermine
the environmental conditions that make agriculture possible
in the first place. Instead, the next agricultural revolution will have to increase the output
of our existing farmland for the long term while protecting biodiversity,
conserving water and reducing pollution
and greenhouse gas emissions. So what will the future farms look like? This drone is part of a fleet
that monitors the crops below. The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered
use of the land that intertwines crops and livestock
with wild habitats. Conventional farming methods
cleared large swathes of land and planted them with a single crop, eradicating wildlife and emitting huge amounts
of greenhouse gases in the process. This approach aims to correct that damage. Meanwhile, moving among the crops, teams of field robots
apply fertilizer in targeted doses. Inside the soil, hundreds of sensors gather data
on nutrients and water levels. This information reduces
unnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply
more and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution
by showering it across the whole farm. But the farms of the future
won't be all sensors and robots. These technologies are designed
to help us produce food in a way that works with the environment rather than against it, taking into account
the nuances of local ecosystems. Lower-cost agricultural practices
can also serve those same goals and are much more accessible
to many farmers. In fact, many such practices
are already in use today and stand to have
an increasingly large impact as more farmers adopt them. In Costa Rica, farmers have intertwined farmland
with tropical habitat so successfully that they have significantly contributed
to doubling the country's forest cover. This provides food
and habitat for wildlife as well as natural pollination
and pest control from the birds and insects
these farms attract, producing food while restoring the planet. In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle
on grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon
and protect biodiversity. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease
greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Rice is a staple food
for three billion people and the main source of livelihood
for millions of households. More than 90 percent of rice
is grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent
of annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas
emissions globally. By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive
ways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased
their incomes and crop yields while cutting down
on greenhouse gas emissions. In Zambia, numerous organizations
are investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production,
reduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers. These efforts are projected
to increase crop yield by almost a quarter
over the next few decades. If combined with methods
to combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused
agricultural sector. And in India, where up to 40 percent
of post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement
solar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers
preserve their produce and become a viable part
of the supply chain. It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech
to the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming. High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented
approaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest
in implementing these technologies. Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access
to the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers. This vision of future farming
will also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions
in food loss and waste, both of which will reduce
pressure on the land and allow farmers to do more
with what they have available. If we optimize food production,
both on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental
limits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented
global cooperation and coordination of the agricultural
lands we have today.

**Transcript**:
At this very moment, almost everything 
around you is being eaten. Invisible to the naked eye, organisms 
called microbes swarm every surface. Hordes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi 
have evolved to produce powerful enzymes that break down tough organic material 
into digestible nutrients. But there’s one particularly widespread 
type of material that almost no microbes can biodegrade: plastics. To make most plastics, molecules 
from oil, gas and coal are refined and turned into long, repeating chains 
called polymers. This process often requires temperatures 
above 100˚C, incredibly high pressure, and various chemical modifications. The resulting man-made polymers 
are quite different from the polymers found in nature. And since they’ve only been 
around since the 1950s, most microbes haven’t had time to evolve 
enzymes to digest them. Making matters even more difficult, breaking most plastics’ chemical bonds 
requires high temperatures comparable to those used to create them— and such heat is deadly to most microbes. This means that most plastics 
never biologically degrade— they just turn into countless, tiny, 
indigestible pieces. And pieces from the most common plastics 
like Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyester-terephthalate
have been piling up for decades. Each year humanity produces roughly 
400 million more tons of plastic, 80% of which is discarded as trash. Of that plastic waste, 
only 10% is recycled. 60% gets incinerated 
or goes into the landfills, and 30% leaks out into the environment where it will pollute natural ecosystems 
for centuries. An estimated 10 million tons of plastic 
waste end up in the ocean each year, mostly in the form of microplastic 
fragments that pollute the food chain. Fortunately, there are microbes 
that may be able to take a bite out of this 
growing problem. In 2016, a team of Japanese researchers 
sampling sludge at a plastic-bottle recycling plant 
discovered Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This never-before-identified bacterium 
contained two enzymes capable of slowly breaking 
down PET polymers at relatively low temperatures. Researchers isolated the genes coding 
for these plastic-digesting enzymes, allowing other bioengineers to combine 
and improve the pair— creating super-enzymes that could break 
down PET up to 6 times faster. Even with this boost, these lab-grown enzymes still took weeks 
to degrade a thin film of PET, and they operated best at temperatures 
below 40˚C. However, another group of scientists 
in Japan had been researching bacterial enzymes adapted 
to high temperature environments like compost piles. And within one particularly warm pile 
of rotting leaves and branches, they found gene sequences 
for powerful degrading enzymes known as Leaf Branch Compost Cutinases. Using fast-growing microorganisms, other researchers were able 
to genetically engineer high quantities of these enzymes. They then enhanced and selected 
special variants of the Cutinases that could degrade PET plastic 
in environments reaching 70˚C— a high temperature that can weaken 
PET polymers and make them digestible. With the help of these 
and other tiny diehards, the future of PET recycling 
looks promising. But PET is just one type of plastic. We still need ways to biologically degrade
all the other types, including abundant PEs and PPs which only begin breaking down 
at temperatures well above 130˚C. Researchers don’t currently know 
of any microbes or enzymes tough enough to tolerate 
such temperatures. So for now, the main way we deal 
with these plastics is through energy-intensive physical 
and chemical processes. Today only a small fraction 
of plasticwaste can be biologically degraded by microbes. Researchers are looking for more 
heat-tolerant plastivores in the planet’s most hostile environments and engineering better 
plastivorous enzymes in the lab. But we can’t rely solely on these tiny 
helpers to clean up our enormous mess. We need to completely rethink 
our relationship with plastics, make better use of existing plastics, and stopproducing more of the same. And we urgently need to design more 
environmentally friendly types of polymers that our growing entourage of plastivores 
can easily break down.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Plastics don’t easily break down biologically into nutrients because:
Options: A. Most naturally occurring microbes haven’t evolved the ability to biodegrade and compost plastics into useable nutrients., B. Most plastics are made from cellulose and lignin which microbes cannot digest., C. Plastic polymers require low temperatures and pressures to break down which are lethal to most biological organisms., D. Plastics aren’t made from carbon chains and therefore have no nutrients to offer.

**Transcript**:
At this very moment, almost everything 
around you is being eaten. Invisible to the naked eye, organisms 
called microbes swarm every surface. Hordes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi 
have evolved to produce powerful enzymes that break down tough organic material 
into digestible nutrients. But there’s one particularly widespread 
type of material that almost no microbes can biodegrade: plastics. To make most plastics, molecules 
from oil, gas and coal are refined and turned into long, repeating chains 
called polymers. This process often requires temperatures 
above 100˚C, incredibly high pressure, and various chemical modifications. The resulting man-made polymers 
are quite different from the polymers found in nature. And since they’ve only been 
around since the 1950s, most microbes haven’t had time to evolve 
enzymes to digest them. Making matters even more difficult, breaking most plastics’ chemical bonds 
requires high temperatures comparable to those used to create them— and such heat is deadly to most microbes. This means that most plastics 
never biologically degrade— they just turn into countless, tiny, 
indigestible pieces. And pieces from the most common plastics 
like Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyester-terephthalate
have been piling up for decades. Each year humanity produces roughly 
400 million more tons of plastic, 80% of which is discarded as trash. Of that plastic waste, 
only 10% is recycled. 60% gets incinerated 
or goes into the landfills, and 30% leaks out into the environment where it will pollute natural ecosystems 
for centuries. An estimated 10 million tons of plastic 
waste end up in the ocean each year, mostly in the form of microplastic 
fragments that pollute the food chain. Fortunately, there are microbes 
that may be able to take a bite out of this 
growing problem. In 2016, a team of Japanese researchers 
sampling sludge at a plastic-bottle recycling plant 
discovered Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This never-before-identified bacterium 
contained two enzymes capable of slowly breaking 
down PET polymers at relatively low temperatures. Researchers isolated the genes coding 
for these plastic-digesting enzymes, allowing other bioengineers to combine 
and improve the pair— creating super-enzymes that could break 
down PET up to 6 times faster. Even with this boost, these lab-grown enzymes still took weeks 
to degrade a thin film of PET, and they operated best at temperatures 
below 40˚C. However, another group of scientists 
in Japan had been researching bacterial enzymes adapted 
to high temperature environments like compost piles. And within one particularly warm pile 
of rotting leaves and branches, they found gene sequences 
for powerful degrading enzymes known as Leaf Branch Compost Cutinases. Using fast-growing microorganisms, other researchers were able 
to genetically engineer high quantities of these enzymes. They then enhanced and selected 
special variants of the Cutinases that could degrade PET plastic 
in environments reaching 70˚C— a high temperature that can weaken 
PET polymers and make them digestible. With the help of these 
and other tiny diehards, the future of PET recycling 
looks promising. But PET is just one type of plastic. We still need ways to biologically degrade
all the other types, including abundant PEs and PPs which only begin breaking down 
at temperatures well above 130˚C. Researchers don’t currently know 
of any microbes or enzymes tough enough to tolerate 
such temperatures. So for now, the main way we deal 
with these plastics is through energy-intensive physical 
and chemical processes. Today only a small fraction 
of plasticwaste can be biologically degraded by microbes. Researchers are looking for more 
heat-tolerant plastivores in the planet’s most hostile environments and engineering better 
plastivorous enzymes in the lab. But we can’t rely solely on these tiny 
helpers to clean up our enormous mess. We need to completely rethink 
our relationship with plastics, make better use of existing plastics, and stopproducing more of the same. And we urgently need to design more 
environmentally friendly types of polymers that our growing entourage of plastivores 
can easily break down.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the derivation of plastics, specifically the long chains of hydrocarbons called polymers. Among the generated MCQs, none directly addresses this question. However, Question 1 mentions the reason why most microbes cannot biodegrade plastics, which is related to the fact that plastics have only been around since the 1950s and are made from materials that microbes haven't had time to evolve enzymes to digest.

Although not a perfect match, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not explicitly address the question about the derivation of plastics.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: What is the estimated amount of plastic waste that is produced each year? Options: A. 100 million tons, B. 200 million tons, C. 400 million tons, D. 600 million tons**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the amount of plastic produced, discarded, and ending up in the ocean, while Question 8 only asks about the amount of plastic waste produced. However, Question 8's options include the correct answer (400 million tons) mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Additionally, Question 2 is also related to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the estimated amount of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean each year. However, it does not include the other two pieces of information (amount produced and discarded) mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it only partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil,
slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer 
of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience. Historically, the union between 
Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium 
between thought and action on which the well-being 
of the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of energy, 
growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, 
and the world would remain static. But together, the two formed 
a divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection 
to all living things. For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped
far and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart 
to Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants
were bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet a rift had grown 
between these two formidable forces. While Parvati sustained daily life 
with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle 
his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling 
about their roles in the universe. He believed that Brahma, 
the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane 
purely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things 
were merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. For millennia Parvati 
had merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed 
the things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove 
the importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy
that kept the Earth turning. At her disappearance, a sudden, 
terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, 
the land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank 
and crops shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity. Parents struggled to console 
their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled. With nothing to eat, people no longer
gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank 
from the darkening world. To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness
left by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune
to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt 
bottomless and unbearable. As Shiva despaired 
over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that 
the material world could not be so easily dismissed. At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati 
could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To walk among them 
and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge 
and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, 
the Goddess of food. With the arrival of Annapurna, 
the world blossomed anew. People rejoiced at fertility and food, 
and communed together to give thanks. Some believe that Annapurna first appeared
in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, 
on the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen 
to fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more. But it was not only mere mortals 
who were served at her feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure
blooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess
with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For this reason, the supreme deity 
is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand,
while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, 
this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world 
is anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life 
that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths 
and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the intent and context, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ.

Although Question 2 does not directly ask for the name of Lord Shiva's wife, it does ask about Parvati's role in the universe, which is closely related to her relationship with Lord Shiva. However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about Lord Shiva's wife.

A more suitable generated MCQ could be:

**Transcript**:
Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil,
slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer 
of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience. Historically, the union between 
Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium 
between thought and action on which the well-being 
of the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of energy, 
growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, 
and the world would remain static. But together, the two formed 
a divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection 
to all living things. For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped
far and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart 
to Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants
were bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet a rift had grown 
between these two formidable forces. While Parvati sustained daily life 
with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle 
his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling 
about their roles in the universe. He believed that Brahma, 
the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane 
purely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things 
were merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. For millennia Parvati 
had merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed 
the things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove 
the importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy
that kept the Earth turning. At her disappearance, a sudden, 
terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, 
the land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank 
and crops shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity. Parents struggled to console 
their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled. With nothing to eat, people no longer
gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank 
from the darkening world. To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness
left by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune
to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt 
bottomless and unbearable. As Shiva despaired 
over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that 
the material world could not be so easily dismissed. At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati 
could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To walk among them 
and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge 
and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, 
the Goddess of food. With the arrival of Annapurna, 
the world blossomed anew. People rejoiced at fertility and food, 
and communed together to give thanks. Some believe that Annapurna first appeared
in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, 
on the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen 
to fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more. But it was not only mere mortals 
who were served at her feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure
blooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess
with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For this reason, the supreme deity 
is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand,
while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, 
this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world 
is anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life 
that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths 
and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth.

**Transcript**:
In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with 
his latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake 
occurred in their kingdom– including the direction 
they should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came 
for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to 
identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique
challenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so 
hard to anticipate, and how could we get better 
at predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories 
behind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten
layer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to 
spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 
centimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful 
enough to cause deep cracks in the
interacting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may 
ultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into 
seismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker–
under pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to
friction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks
moving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables 
should we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our 
growing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur 
at largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates 
is somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues 
come from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions 
about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict 
very loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the 
vibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are 
also capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially 
crowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts 
people to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able
to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings 
would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck 
the east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly 
high concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: 
radon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right 
before an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built 
a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising 
warning system– potentially predicting quakes 
a week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies 
would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside 
the earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale 
geological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands 
of lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare 
and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions 
from a vase.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the instrument used to record seismic waves, and the correct answer is "A seismometer." Question 7 mentions Quakesim software, which uses geological data, including data from seismometers, to identify regions at risk of earthquakes. Although it does not directly ask about the instrument, it is related to the topic of recording and analyzing seismic data.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the instrument used to record seismic waves. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would say it's Question 7, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with 
his latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake 
occurred in their kingdom– including the direction 
they should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came 
for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to 
identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique
challenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so 
hard to anticipate, and how could we get better 
at predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories 
behind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten
layer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to 
spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 
centimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful 
enough to cause deep cracks in the
interacting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may 
ultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into 
seismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker–
under pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to
friction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks
moving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables 
should we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our 
growing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur 
at largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates 
is somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues 
come from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions 
about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict 
very loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the 
vibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are 
also capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially 
crowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts 
people to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able
to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings 
would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck 
the east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly 
high concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: 
radon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right 
before an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built 
a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising 
warning system– potentially predicting quakes 
a week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies 
would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside 
the earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale 
geological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands 
of lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare 
and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions 
from a vase.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1953, a tidal surge 
shook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded 
the Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm 
threatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands 
were ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors 
activated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms 
swung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm 
with the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed 
with minimal flooding. The first field activation 
of the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile 
structures, this storm surge barrier 
is a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part
of a massive, interlocking system of water controls 
known as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention 
project in the world. The Netherlands has a long history 
with water management. The country lies along the delta 
of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory 
is below sea level. This geography makes the region 
extremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest 
Dutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that 
coordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch
government took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting 
the entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds 
of flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe
as the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required
various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam 
the region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of 
the country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed 
flood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta 
Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve 
as nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work 
for the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping 
industry, this passage had to be kept open 
in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible 
protection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, 
like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk 
of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on 
holding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, 
the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works 
and protect against floods further inland. Under the "Room for the River" plan, farms and dikes were relocated 
away from the shore. This left more space for water 
to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats 
for local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only 
decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped 
settlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' 
multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city 
almost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts 
are protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts 
have been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs 
that store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city 
transform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters 
and sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating 
pavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned 
amphibious structures, some of which house water purification
systems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some 
of the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands 
at the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways 
to make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels 
caused by climate change threaten low-lying cities 
across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional 
example of how to go with the flow.

holding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, 
the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works 
and protect against floods further inland. Under the "Room for the River" plan, farms and dikes were relocated 
away from the shore. This left more space for water 
to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats 
for local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only 
decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped 
settlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' 
multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city 
almost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts 
are protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts 
have been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs 
that store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city 
transform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters 
and sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating 
pavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned 
amphibious structures, some of which house water purification
systems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some 
of the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands 
at the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways 
to make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels 
caused by climate change threaten low-lying cities 
across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional 
example of how to go with the flow.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it took from the creation of the Delta Commission to the construction completion of the Maeslantkering. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions the Delta Works, which is related to the Delta Commission and the Maeslantkering.

However, a more relevant question would be one that asks about the timeline or the history of the Delta Commission and the Maeslantkering. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask such a question.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 3, but with a note that it's not a good match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (with a note that it's not a good match)

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more relevant to the ground truth MCQ. Some possible generated MCQs could be:

* What year was the Delta Commission established, and what was its primary goal?
* How long did it take to complete the Maeslantkering after the Delta Commission was established?
* What was the timeline for the construction of the Maeslantkering, and when was it completed?

These generated MCQs would be more relevant to the ground truth MCQ and would provide a better match.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1953, a tidal surge 
shook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded 
the Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm 
threatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands 
were ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors 
activated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms 
swung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm 
with the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed 
with minimal flooding. The first field activation 
of the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile 
structures, this storm surge barrier 
is a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part
of a massive, interlocking system of water controls 
known as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention 
project in the world. The Netherlands has a long history 
with water management. The country lies along the delta 
of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory 
is below sea level. This geography makes the region 
extremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest 
Dutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that 
coordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch
government took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting 
the entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds 
of flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe
as the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required
various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam 
the region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of 
the country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed 
flood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta 
Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve 
as nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work 
for the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping 
industry, this passage had to be kept open 
in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible 
protection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, 
like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk 
of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on 
holding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, 
the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what is NOT a flood prevention measure, and the correct answer is a ball joint. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 2 mentions the Maeslantkering, which is a storm surge barrier that uses 680-tonne ball joints to move in rhythm with the shifting wind and waves.

Although Question 2 does not ask about what is NOT a flood prevention measure, it does mention a ball joint in the context of a flood prevention measure. Therefore, I would suggest Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, albeit with a different question intent.

**Transcript**:
In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission
to take over Eurasia, swiftly conquering countries and drawing 
them into his expanding Mongol Empire. With his vast armies he became almost 
unstoppable. But, legend has it that there was 
one obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t 
overcome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from 
invading their territory. No one knows how historically accurate 
that particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram 
and Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers 
and using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating 
phenomenon, it’s important to understand the 
difference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and 
accumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the 
stacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, 
summer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, 
and centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted 
glacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great 
mountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for
centuries that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different 
genders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers
by grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and 
female glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, 
wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully 
active glaciers that grow each year with 
additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting 
reserves of water that farmers can use 
to irrigate their crops. These practices have spread 
to other cultures, where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious 
modern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region
in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the 
Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten 
centimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because 
of climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing 
their own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: 
horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when 
farmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series
of basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of 
water into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin 
with another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with 
irrigation for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using 
the meltwater from already-existing glaciers 
high above their villages. The meltwater enters channels 
that run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing
straight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs 
out of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice 
sculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount
of surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water 
to feed the farmers’ crops. These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own
glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier 
growing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 
in the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in 
villages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness
our homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s
harshest landscapes.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the geographical locations where glaciers can be found, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to glaciers, such as their growth, types, and uses.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of glaciers and their geographical locations, I would select Question 9: "Where are plans to create over 100 more stupas?" (Options: A. Villages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, B. Villages in India, China, and Nepal, C. Villages in Switzerland, France, and Italy, D. Villages in the United States, Canada, and Mexico). Although this question does not directly ask about the locations of glaciers, it mentions specific regions where glaciers (in the form of stupas) are being created.

Please note that this selection is based on a loose connection between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, as none of the generated MCQs accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, Question 4 is the closest match in terms of discussing the impact of environmental changes on glaciers and the purpose of creating artificial glaciers.

But since it does not discuss why wild glaciers are shrinking, there isn't a direct match.

However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the topic of climate and glaciers, I would say Question 4 is the closest.

**Transcript**:
In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission
to take over Eurasia, swiftly conquering countries and drawing 
them into his expanding Mongol Empire. With his vast armies he became almost 
unstoppable. But, legend has it that there was 
one obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t 
overcome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from 
invading their territory. No one knows how historically accurate 
that particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram 
and Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers 
and using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating 
phenomenon, it’s important to understand the 
difference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and 
accumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the 
stacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, 
summer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, 
and centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted 
glacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great 
mountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for
centuries that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different 
genders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers
by grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and 
female glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, 
wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully 
active glaciers that grow each year with 
additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting 
reserves of water that farmers can use 
to irrigate their crops. These practices have spread 
to other cultures, where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious 
modern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region
in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the 
Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten 
centimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because 
of climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing 
their own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: 
horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when 
farmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series
of basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of 
water into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin 
with another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with 
irrigation for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using 
the meltwater from already-existing glaciers 
high above their villages. The meltwater enters channels 
that run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing
straight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs 
out of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice 
sculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount
of surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water 
to feed the farmers’ crops. These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own
glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier 
growing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 
in the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in 
villages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness
our homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s
harshest landscapes.

**Transcript**:
You’ve filled up your cart and made 
it to the front of the grocery line when you’re confronted 
with yet another choice: what kind of bag should you use? If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags
strewn across the ocean, it might seem obvious that plastic 
is bad for the environment. Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote
would be the better option. But is that really true? Each of these three materials 
has a unique environmental impact that’s determined by its carbon footprint, its potential to be reused and recycled,
and its degradability. So, to get the full story 
on these grocery bags we need to look at how they’re made, how they’re used, 
and where they ultimately go. Let’s start with plastic. The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag 
is made of high-density polyethylene, commonly known as HDPE. Producing this material requires
extracting petroleum from the ground and applying extreme heat. The resulting polymer resin 
is then transported alongside additional ingredients 
like titanium oxide and chalk to a bag manufacturing plant. Here, coal powered machines 
melt the materials down and spin them into sheets of plastic, which are then folded into bags. By the time a bag reaches
its final destination, it’s contributed an estimated 1.6 kg
of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the same amount of carbon
a car produces, driving a little over 6 kilometers. But the alternatives actually possess
a much larger carbon footprint. Paper is made from wood pulp, and when you account for the carbon cost
of removing trees from their ecosystems, a single paper bag can be responsible
for about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely
energy and water intensive process. The production of a single cotton tote emits an estimated 272 kg
of carbon dioxide. When we compare carbon footprints,
plastic bags are the clear winner. But environmental impact 
is also determined by how the bag is used. Reusing or recycling these bags significantly offsets 
their environmental toll by reducing demand for new production. To quantify that offset, we can divide
the bag’s carbon footprint by the number of times it’s reused. For example, if a typical paper bag 
is reused three times, it has a lower net impact 
than a single-use plastic bag. The carbon footprint of a cotton tote
can similarly be lowered, if it’s reused 131 times. Of these three options, durable cloth
totes are most likely to be reused. Evidence shows paper bags are quickly
discarded due to their tendency to tear. This issue plagues HDPE
plastic bags as well. But even when they’re made 
to avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes
it easy to treat them as single-use items. Fortunately, researchers estimate
that 40% of HDPE bags are reused at least once
for throwing out waste. Recycling these bags also offsets 
their carbon footprint, but it’s not universally possible 
for each material. Many countries lack the infrastructure
to efficiently recycle plastic bags. Cotton totes are perhaps even more
difficult to breakdown and process, but since they’re often reused 
for long periods, they’re still least likely 
to end up in landfills. Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating
environmental impact comes into play: degradability. Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant
and insoluble, they stick around long after we’re done
with them. Partially broken down plastic 
can circulate in ecosystems for centuries. Cotton on the other hand degrades
substantially in a matter of months, and paper bags break down 
completely in just 90 days. So, which bag should you use? It turns out the most 
environmentally friendly bags have features of several materials
we've discussed. They’re durable and reusable, like cotton,
but made of plastic, which has a lower carbon footprint
than cotton or paper. These sturdy shopping bags consist of
polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide. Most importantly, 
they should last a lifetime— making them the best option 
for the planet, and your groceries.

is made of high-density polyethylene, commonly known as HDPE. Producing this material requires
extracting petroleum from the ground and applying extreme heat. The resulting polymer resin 
is then transported alongside additional ingredients 
like titanium oxide and chalk to a bag manufacturing plant. Here, coal powered machines 
melt the materials down and spin them into sheets of plastic, which are then folded into bags. By the time a bag reaches
its final destination, it’s contributed an estimated 1.6 kg
of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the same amount of carbon
a car produces, driving a little over 6 kilometers. But the alternatives actually possess
a much larger carbon footprint. Paper is made from wood pulp, and when you account for the carbon cost
of removing trees from their ecosystems, a single paper bag can be responsible
for about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely
energy and water intensive process. The production of a single cotton tote emits an estimated 272 kg
of carbon dioxide. When we compare carbon footprints,
plastic bags are the clear winner. But environmental impact 
is also determined by how the bag is used. Reusing or recycling these bags significantly offsets 
their environmental toll by reducing demand for new production. To quantify that offset, we can divide
the bag’s carbon footprint by the number of times it’s reused. For example, if a typical paper bag 
is reused three times, it has a lower net impact 
than a single-use plastic bag. The carbon footprint of a cotton tote
can similarly be lowered, if it’s reused 131 times. Of these three options, durable cloth
totes are most likely to be reused. Evidence shows paper bags are quickly
discarded due to their tendency to tear. This issue plagues HDPE
plastic bags as well. But even when they’re made 
to avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes
it easy to treat them as single-use items. Fortunately, researchers estimate
that 40% of HDPE bags are reused at least once
for throwing out waste. Recycling these bags also offsets 
their carbon footprint, but it’s not universally possible 
for each material. Many countries lack the infrastructure
to efficiently recycle plastic bags. Cotton totes are perhaps even more
difficult to breakdown and process, but since they’re often reused 
for long periods, they’re still least likely 
to end up in landfills. Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating
environmental impact comes into play: degradability. Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant
and insoluble, they stick around long after we’re done
with them. Partially broken down plastic 
can circulate in ecosystems for centuries. Cotton on the other hand degrades
substantially in a matter of months, and paper bags break down 
completely in just 90 days. So, which bag should you use? It turns out the most 
environmentally friendly bags have features of several materials
we've discussed. They’re durable and reusable, like cotton,
but made of plastic, which has a lower carbon footprint
than cotton or paper. These sturdy shopping bags consist of
polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide. Most importantly, 
they should last a lifetime— making them the best option 
for the planet, and your groceries.

**Transcript**:
You’ve filled up your cart and made 
it to the front of the grocery line when you’re confronted 
with yet another choice: what kind of bag should you use? If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags
strewn across the ocean, it might seem obvious that plastic 
is bad for the environment. Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote
would be the better option. But is that really true? Each of these three materials 
has a unique environmental impact that’s determined by its carbon footprint, its potential to be reused and recycled,
and its degradability. So, to get the full story 
on these grocery bags we need to look at how they’re made, how they’re used, 
and where they ultimately go. Let’s start with plastic. The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag

**Transcript**:
In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska 
were enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city. But their laughter froze when they heard
the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door. Sendler rushed to the window to dispose
of incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina 
her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names 
of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety. This arrest wasn’t the first consequence 
Sendler had faced in her lifelong crusade
against anti-Semitism. Born to Catholic parents in 1910,
she grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish 
patients other doctors refused to help. Irena was furious at the constant
discrimination against her Jewish friends. As a graduate student in social welfare
at the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced 
the segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation
for troublemaking. Buoyed by her socialist ideals 
and inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish
families across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism
surging through Europe. But in September 1939, 
Nazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further
eroded Jewish rights. In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds
of thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just 
over one square mile of land. Bordered by high walls and subject 
to constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto
quickly became starving and sick. Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues
secured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking
for typhus outbreaks. At first, her group worked 
to smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish 
officials and the medical underground. But as desperate parents began sending
their children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that
to help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape. Sendler and her associates developed 
a coordinated campaign of rescue missions. Children were bundled into dirty laundry,
packed into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses 
in coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases. Bigger children escaped 
through the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries. Sendler helped ferry these children 
to safe houses, before forging them new documents 
and sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families
across Poland. To retain their Jewish identities
and keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records
on thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars. This work was punishable by death. But for Sendler, such consequences
paled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents
to part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion. In 1942, the Nazis began transporting 
Jews from the ghetto into concentration camps. Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi
resistance group called Zegota. Zegota helped Sendler expand her
operation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw. But this system would also be 
Sendler’s downfall. When the Gestapo threatened a laundry
owner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name. At 3am on October 20th, the 
Gestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews
throughout the country. The police had captured Sendler,
but her records remained safe. Janina protected the children’s names
with her life, all without knowing whether 
her friend would ever return. Despite enduring months of physical
and psychological torture, Sendler betrayed no information. Defiant to the end, she was sentenced
to execution on January 20th, 1944. But as she walked to her death, 
a German officer diverted her course. Zegota had paid the Gestapo 
the modern equivalent of over $100,000 for Sendler’s release. That night as she listened to bullhorns
proclaiming her death, Sendler’s work began anew. Remaining in hiding, she continued 
to oversee Zegota’s rescue missions until Germany’s defeat in 1945. After the war, Sendler reconnected
with the children she’d helped escape, remaining in contact with many
for the rest of her life. And while the new Polish government
sought to suppress her story, the children she rescued ensured 
she was recognized for her work. Yet despite all the lives she saved, Sendler remained hesitant to accept
praise for her actions, remarking, “I continue to have qualms of conscience
that I did so little.”

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 does not specifically ask about how Irena Sendler kept her records, but rather why she kept them, it's not a perfect match.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about how Irena Sendler kept her records, but such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

It would be more accurate to say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska 
were enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city. But their laughter froze when they heard
the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door. Sendler rushed to the window to dispose
of incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina 
her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names 
of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety. This arrest wasn’t the first consequence 
Sendler had faced in her lifelong crusade
against anti-Semitism. Born to Catholic parents in 1910,
she grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish 
patients other doctors refused to help. Irena was furious at the constant
discrimination against her Jewish friends. As a graduate student in social welfare
at the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced 
the segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation
for troublemaking. Buoyed by her socialist ideals 
and inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish
families across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism
surging through Europe. But in September 1939, 
Nazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further
eroded Jewish rights. In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds
of thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just 
over one square mile of land. Bordered by high walls and subject 
to constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto
quickly became starving and sick. Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues
secured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking
for typhus outbreaks. At first, her group worked 
to smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish 
officials and the medical underground. But as desperate parents began sending
their children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that
to help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape. Sendler and her associates developed 
a coordinated campaign of rescue missions. Children were bundled into dirty laundry,
packed into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses 
in coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases. Bigger children escaped 
through the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries. Sendler helped ferry these children 
to safe houses, before forging them new documents 
and sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families
across Poland. To retain their Jewish identities
and keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records
on thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars. This work was punishable by death. But for Sendler, such consequences
paled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents
to part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion. In 1942, the Nazis began transporting 
Jews from the ghetto into concentration camps. Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi
resistance group called Zegota. Zegota helped Sendler expand her
operation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw. But this system would also be 
Sendler’s downfall. When the Gestapo threatened a laundry
owner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name. At 3am on October 20th, the 
Gestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews
throughout the country. The police had captured Sendler,
but her records remained safe. Janina protected the children’s names
with her life, all without knowing whether 
her friend would ever return. Despite enduring months of physical
and psychological torture, Sendler betrayed no information. Defiant to the end, she was sentenced
to execution on January 20th, 1944. But as she walked to her death, 
a German officer diverted her course. Zegota had paid the Gestapo 
the modern equivalent of over $100,000 for Sendler’s release. That night as she listened to bullhorns
proclaiming her death, Sendler’s work began anew. Remaining in hiding, she continued 
to oversee Zegota’s rescue missions until Germany’s defeat in 1945. After the war, Sendler reconnected
with the children she’d helped escape, remaining in contact with many
for the rest of her life. And while the new Polish government
sought to suppress her story, the children she rescued ensured 
she was recognized for her work. Yet despite all the lives she saved, Sendler remained hesitant to accept
praise for her actions, remarking, “I continue to have qualms of conscience
that I did so little.”

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the Nazis' arrangement for the forced removal of Jewish communities from the Warsaw ghetto. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, Question 7 mentions the Warsaw Ghetto and the conditions faced by the people living there.

Although Question 7 does not specifically ask about the forced removal of Jewish communities, it is the closest generated MCQ that relates to the context of the Warsaw Ghetto.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Whether she’s describing 
bickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as 
though it was written just for you. Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness 
informs her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers
with a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers 
feel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully 
wicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of 
tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found 
in her sly satires of society, civility, 
and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode 
the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common 
thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style 
of writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, 
and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, 
friendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs 
about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules 
of their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, 
and small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, 
but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule 
senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical 
importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial 
necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between
the mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits 
of making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums 
this up in "Mansfield Park;" “I would have everybody marry 
if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people 
throw themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also 
present in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles 
found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write 
and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found
in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, 
pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide 
an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet 
of "Pride and Prejudice," whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives 
blinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot 
of "Persuasion," who chooses to remain unmarried 
after the disappearance of her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family 
at the cost of her own desires in "Sense and Sensibility." These women all encounter 
difficult choices about romantic, filial, and 
financial stability, and they resolve them without 
sacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters 
are far from perfect. They often think they have 
all the answers. And by telling the story 
from their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing 
their heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under 
the protagonist and the reader. In "Emma," the titular character feels 
surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope 
to match her wit. As her guests prattle on and 
on about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character 
in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control 
as she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing 
her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the 
inconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen 
prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable 
for modern sensibilities. So hopefully, new readers will continue 
to find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to come.

feel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully 
wicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of 
tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found 
in her sly satires of society, civility, 
and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode 
the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common 
thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style 
of writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, 
and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, 
friendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs 
about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules 
of their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, 
and small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, 
but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule 
senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical 
importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial 
necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between
the mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits 
of making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums 
this up in "Mansfield Park;" “I would have everybody marry 
if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people 
throw themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also 
present in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles 
found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write 
and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found
in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, 
pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide 
an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet 
of "Pride and Prejudice," whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives 
blinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot 
of "Persuasion," who chooses to remain unmarried 
after the disappearance of her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family 
at the cost of her own desires in "Sense and Sensibility." These women all encounter 
difficult choices about romantic, filial, and 
financial stability, and they resolve them without 
sacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters 
are far from perfect. They often think they have 
all the answers. And by telling the story 
from their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing 
their heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under 
the protagonist and the reader. In "Emma," the titular character feels 
surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope 
to match her wit. As her guests prattle on and 
on about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character 
in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control 
as she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing 
her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the 
inconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen 
prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable 
for modern sensibilities. So hopefully, new readers will continue 
to find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to come.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the heroine of Pride and Prejudice, while the generated MCQs do not specifically ask about the heroine of Pride and Prejudice. However, Question 7 asks about a notable characteristic of Austen's heroines, and one of the options (B) mentions that they are intelligent, witty, and pragmatic, which is a characteristic of Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice.

Although not a direct match, I would suggest that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it relates to the characteristics of Austen's heroines, including Elizabeth Bennet.

**Transcript**:
Noor Inayat Khan was in the midst of a 
desperate escape. She had been imprisoned for her activities
as an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and 
two other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind 
of events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian 
Muslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly 
peaceful home. Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of 
music and compassion. They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology 
and published children’s books. But all this changed with the advent 
of the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army 
ready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced 
with a difficult choice. As pacifists, they believed that all 
disputes should be settled non-violently. But witnessing the devastation 
across Europe, they decided that standing on the 
sidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s 
Auxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless 
operations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored 
by a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive 
was established to sabotage the Germans 
in Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio operator who knew 
Paris well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In her interview, she was warned that 
wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work 
in the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous 
transmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t 
protect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her 
pacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence 
networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed 
in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed 
with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, 
and Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors 
to let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio 
operators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies 
to the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back 
to London and arranged safe passage 
for allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the 
French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick 
thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way 
out of questioning. When the Gestapo searched 
her on the train, she gave them a casual tour 
of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted 
her hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for 
listening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping 
her set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth 
never failed her. But her charm had inspired 
lethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister 
of a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away 
from the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight 
and slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began 
to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again 
and sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured, 
deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who 
waged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom 
without ever taking a life.

sidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s 
Auxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless 
operations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored 
by a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive 
was established to sabotage the Germans 
in Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio operator who knew 
Paris well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In her interview, she was warned that 
wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work 
in the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous 
transmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t 
protect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her 
pacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence 
networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed 
in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed 
with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, 
and Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors 
to let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio 
operators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies 
to the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back 
to London and arranged safe passage 
for allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the 
French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick 
thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way 
out of questioning. When the Gestapo searched 
her on the train, she gave them a casual tour 
of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted 
her hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for 
listening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping 
her set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth 
never failed her. But her charm had inspired 
lethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister 
of a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away 
from the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight 
and slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began 
to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again 
and sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured, 
deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who 
waged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom 
without ever taking a life.

**Transcript**:
Noor Inayat Khan was in the midst of a 
desperate escape. She had been imprisoned for her activities
as an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and 
two other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind 
of events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian 
Muslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly 
peaceful home. Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of 
music and compassion. They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology 
and published children’s books. But all this changed with the advent 
of the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army 
ready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced 
with a difficult choice. As pacifists, they believed that all 
disputes should be settled non-violently. But witnessing the devastation 
across Europe, they decided that standing on the 
sidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s 
Auxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless

**Transcript**:
The discovery of the structure of DNA was one of the most important scientific
achievements in the last century, in human history, in fact. The now-famous double helix is almost
synonymous with Watson and Crick, two of the scientists who won
the Nobel Prize for figuring it out. But there's another name 
you may know, too, Rosalind Franklin. You may have heard that her data supported
Watson and Crick's brilliant idea, or that she was a plain-dressing,
belligerent scientist, which is how Watson actually described her
in "The Double Helix." But thanks to Franklin's biographers, who investigated her life 
and interviewed many people close to her, we now know that that account
is far from true, and her scientific contributions
have been vastly underplayed. Let's hear the real story. Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born
in London in 1920. She wanted to be a scientist ever
since she was a teenager, which wasn't a common or easy
career path for girls at that time. But she excelled at science anyway. She won a scholarship to Cambridge
to study chemistry, where she earned her Ph.D., and she later conducted research on
the structure of coal that led to better gas masks for 
the British during World War II. In 1951, she joined King's College to use x-ray techniques to study
the structure of DNA, then one of the hottest topics in science. Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab
and got to work shining high-energy x-rays 
on tiny, wet crystals of DNA. But the acadmemic culture at the time
wasn't very friendly to women, and Franklin was isolated 
from her colleagues. She clashed with Maurice Wilkins, a labmate who assumed Franklin
had been hired as his assistant. But Franklin kept working, and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51,
the most famous x-ray image of DNA. Just getting the image took 100 hours, the calculations necessary to analyze it
would take a year. Meanwhile, the American biologist
James Watson and the British physicist Francis Crick were also working 
on finding DNA's structure. Without Franklin's knowledge, Wilkins took Photo 51
and showed it to Watson and Crick. Instead of calculating the exact
position of every atom, they did a quick analysis 
of Franklin's data and used that to build 
a few potential structures. Eventually, they arrived at the right one. DNA is made of two helicoidal strands, one opposite the other with bases
in the center like rungs of a ladder. Watson and Crick published their model
in April 1953. Meanwhile, 
Franklin had finished her calculations, come to the same conclusion, and submitted her own manuscript. The journal published 
the manuscripts together, but put Franklin's last, making it look like her experiments just
confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough instead of inspiring it. But Franklin had already 
stopped working on DNA and died of cancer in 1958, never knowing that Watson and Crick
had seen her photographs. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won
the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA. It's often said that Franklin would have
been recognized by a Nobel Prize if only they could be 
awarded posthumously. And, in fact, it's possible 
she could have won twice. Her work on the structure of viruses
led to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982. It's time to tell the story of a brave
woman who fought sexism in science, and whose work revolutionized
medicine, biology, and agriculture. It's time to honor 
Rosalind Elsie Franklin, the unsung mother of the double helix.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks why Franklin wasn't mentioned in the 1953 article by Watson and Crick. The closest generated MCQ is Question 8, which asks why Rosalind Franklin did not receive the Nobel Prize for her work on DNA. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the recognition of Franklin's contributions.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that specifically addresses the question of why Franklin wasn't mentioned in the 1953 article.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but it's still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
The discovery of the structure of DNA was one of the most important scientific
achievements in the last century, in human history, in fact. The now-famous double helix is almost
synonymous with Watson and Crick, two of the scientists who won
the Nobel Prize for figuring it out. But there's another name 
you may know, too, Rosalind Franklin. You may have heard that her data supported
Watson and Crick's brilliant idea, or that she was a plain-dressing,
belligerent scientist, which is how Watson actually described her
in "The Double Helix." But thanks to Franklin's biographers, who investigated her life 
and interviewed many people close to her, we now know that that account
is far from true, and her scientific contributions
have been vastly underplayed. Let's hear the real story. Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born
in London in 1920. She wanted to be a scientist ever
since she was a teenager, which wasn't a common or easy
career path for girls at that time. But she excelled at science anyway. She won a scholarship to Cambridge
to study chemistry, where she earned her Ph.D., and she later conducted research on
the structure of coal that led to better gas masks for 
the British during World War II. In 1951, she joined King's College to use x-ray techniques to study
the structure of DNA, then one of the hottest topics in science. Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab
and got to work shining high-energy x-rays 
on tiny, wet crystals of DNA. But the acadmemic culture at the time
wasn't very friendly to women, and Franklin was isolated 
from her colleagues. She clashed with Maurice Wilkins, a labmate who assumed Franklin
had been hired as his assistant. But Franklin kept working, and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51,
the most famous x-ray image of DNA. Just getting the image took 100 hours, the calculations necessary to analyze it
would take a year. Meanwhile, the American biologist
James Watson and the British physicist Francis Crick were also working 
on finding DNA's structure. Without Franklin's knowledge, Wilkins took Photo 51
and showed it to Watson and Crick. Instead of calculating the exact
position of every atom, they did a quick analysis 
of Franklin's data and used that to build 
a few potential structures. Eventually, they arrived at the right one. DNA is made of two helicoidal strands, one opposite the other with bases
in the center like rungs of a ladder. Watson and Crick published their model
in April 1953. Meanwhile, 
Franklin had finished her calculations, come to the same conclusion, and submitted her own manuscript. The journal published 
the manuscripts together, but put Franklin's last, making it look like her experiments just
confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough instead of inspiring it. But Franklin had already 
stopped working on DNA and died of cancer in 1958, never knowing that Watson and Crick
had seen her photographs. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won
the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA. It's often said that Franklin would have
been recognized by a Nobel Prize if only they could be 
awarded posthumously. And, in fact, it's possible 
she could have won twice. Her work on the structure of viruses
led to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982. It's time to tell the story of a brave
woman who fought sexism in science, and whose work revolutionized
medicine, biology, and agriculture. It's time to honor 
Rosalind Elsie Franklin, the unsung mother of the double helix.

**Transcript**:
From 1930 to 1961, thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered under Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship 
in the Dominican Republic. Three sisters would go on to lead 
an underground revolution. But while their courage inspired many,
it threatened the man in power, and their lives would come 
to a tragic early end. Trujillo rose through the military ranks 
during the United States’ occupation of the Dominican Republic. He assumed power in 1930 through a coup
and rigged election and created a system that enriched 
himself and his allies. Trujillo’s family alone 
controlled three-fifths of the country’s gross domestic product, including monopolies 
over salt, beef, and newspapers. He renamed the country's
capital after himself and expected his portrait to be
displayed in every household. And he committed atrocities, including 
the massacre of thousands of Haitians. All the while, a secret police force
maintained his power by targeting opponents at home and abroad. The Mirabal sisters grew up in a middle
class family in the countryside. Their parents sent the four sisters— Patria, Dedé, Minerva, and María Teresa— to one of the country’s 
best boarding schools. There, Minerva met a classmate whose
relative was killed on Trujillo's orders. She began seeking out strong
voices of opposition and discussing issues of oppression
and justice with her sisters. While Dedé stayed out of politics, Minerva, Patria, and María Teresa became
invested in changing their country. However, the Mirabal family’s 
safe standing soon collapsed. In 1949, they were invited 
to one of Trujillo’s parties, which served as his personal hunting
grounds for young women. Declining the invitation
was not an option. Despite Minerva’s attempts 
to avoid him at the reception, she eventually danced with Trujillo
but rejected his advances. The Mirabal family left the party early, which was seldom done and considered
disrespectful to the dictator. Their father, Enrique, was imprisoned
and family property was confiscated. Minerva graduated with highest honors as one of the first women in the country 
to receive a law degree. But she was denied state authorization
to practice— a process Trujillo oversaw. While studying, Minerva met 
Manolo Tavárez Justo. He shared her political convictions
and the two married in 1955. They watched as armed revolutions launched
throughout Latin America. After Trujillo crushed an attempt
to overthrow him in 1959, they began to prepare a revolution
of their own. The Mirabal sisters and their husbands
formed the June 14th movement along with many others 
from the middle class. Codenamed Las Mariposas, 
or the Butterflies, the three sisters organized 
and attended clandestine meetings and distributed pamphlets detailing
Trujillo’s violations. In January of 1960, they called representatives together 
from all over the country to establish the movement’s structure 
and prepare an uprising. But it was not to be. Trujillo had spies everywhere. Soon, many revolutionaries, including
Minerva and María Teresa, were arrested. During this time, Patria found creative
ways of transmitting information to and from imprisoned rebels. Fearful of losing the support
of the U.S. and the Church, which had recently begun to criticize him, Trujillo released the sisters while
leaving their husbands imprisoned. But they continued to threaten 
his regime’s stability— and his ego. On November 25th, as the three sisters were returning from 
visiting two of their imprisoned husbands, Trujillo’s men stopped their car. The sisters, along with their driver,
Rufino de la Cruz, were asphyxiated and beaten to death. The men rolled the Jeep off a hill 
to frame the murder as a car accident. Patria was 36, Minerva was 33,
and María Teresa was 25. But Trujillo's plan to silence
the Mirabal sisters and stabilize his regime 
backfired. Much of the public wasn’t fooled
by the flimsy coverup. The international community condemned
the assassination. And the U.S. closed its Dominican embassy and secretly invested 
in the anti-Trujillo movement. Months later, former members 
of the Dominican military killed the dictator, bringing his violent,
31-year reign to an end. Thanks to their family, especially
their surviving sister, Dedé, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters would 
surpass the clutches of Trujillo’s tyranny even long after their deaths. Today, the Mirabal sisters
are national heroes with monuments and honors 
commemorating their struggle. In 1999, the United Nations
declared November 25th, the anniversary of their deaths, the International Day for the Elimination
of Violence Against Women. Their courageous fight for justice
has inspired generations.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the opposition of the Mirabal sisters, which is not present among the provided options.

However, if I had to choose from the given options, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match because it mentions the Mirabal sisters as leaders of an underground revolution, which implies opposition to a regime or government.

But since the options provided in Question 2 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will try to find another question that might be a better match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content and intent of the questions.

A possible match could be a generated MCQ that asks about the regime or government that the Mirabal sisters opposed. In this case, Question 1 could be a possible match, as it asks about Rafael Trujillo and his role in the Dominican Republic.

However, the options provided in Question 1 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose from the given options, I would say that Question 1 is a possible match because it mentions Rafael Trujillo and his role in the Dominican Republic, which is related to the regime that the Mirabal sisters opposed.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 1 as a possible match, but with the caveat that the options provided do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From 1930 to 1961, thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered under Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship 
in the Dominican Republic. Three sisters would go on to lead 
an underground revolution. But while their courage inspired many,
it threatened the man in power, and their lives would come 
to a tragic early end. Trujillo rose through the military ranks 
during the United States’ occupation of the Dominican Republic. He assumed power in 1930 through a coup
and rigged election and created a system that enriched 
himself and his allies. Trujillo’s family alone 
controlled three-fifths of the country’s gross domestic product, including monopolies 
over salt, beef, and newspapers. He renamed the country's
capital after himself and expected his portrait to be
displayed in every household. And he committed atrocities, including 
the massacre of thousands of Haitians. All the while, a secret police force
maintained his power by targeting opponents at home and abroad. The Mirabal sisters grew up in a middle
class family in the countryside. Their parents sent the four sisters— Patria, Dedé, Minerva, and María Teresa— to one of the country’s 
best boarding schools. There, Minerva met a classmate whose
relative was killed on Trujillo's orders. She began seeking out strong
voices of opposition and discussing issues of oppression
and justice with her sisters. While Dedé stayed out of politics, Minerva, Patria, and María Teresa became
invested in changing their country. However, the Mirabal family’s 
safe standing soon collapsed. In 1949, they were invited 
to one of Trujillo’s parties, which served as his personal hunting
grounds for young women. Declining the invitation
was not an option. Despite Minerva’s attempts 
to avoid him at the reception, she eventually danced with Trujillo
but rejected his advances. The Mirabal family left the party early, which was seldom done and considered
disrespectful to the dictator. Their father, Enrique, was imprisoned
and family property was confiscated. Minerva graduated with highest honors as one of the first women in the country 
to receive a law degree. But she was denied state authorization
to practice— a process Trujillo oversaw. While studying, Minerva met 
Manolo Tavárez Justo. He shared her political convictions
and the two married in 1955. They watched as armed revolutions launched
throughout Latin America. After Trujillo crushed an attempt
to overthrow him in 1959, they began to prepare a revolution
of their own. The Mirabal sisters and their husbands
formed the June 14th movement along with many others 
from the middle class. Codenamed Las Mariposas, 
or the Butterflies, the three sisters organized 
and attended clandestine meetings and distributed pamphlets detailing
Trujillo’s violations. In January of 1960, they called representatives together 
from all over the country to establish the movement’s structure 
and prepare an uprising. But it was not to be. Trujillo had spies everywhere. Soon, many revolutionaries, including
Minerva and María Teresa, were arrested. During this time, Patria found creative
ways of transmitting information to and from imprisoned rebels. Fearful of losing the support
of the U.S. and the Church, which had recently begun to criticize him, Trujillo released the sisters while
leaving their husbands imprisoned. But they continued to threaten 
his regime’s stability— and his ego. On November 25th, as the three sisters were returning from 
visiting two of their imprisoned husbands, Trujillo’s men stopped their car. The sisters, along with their driver,
Rufino de la Cruz, were asphyxiated and beaten to death. The men rolled the Jeep off a hill 
to frame the murder as a car accident. Patria was 36, Minerva was 33,
and María Teresa was 25. But Trujillo's plan to silence
the Mirabal sisters and stabilize his regime 
backfired. Much of the public wasn’t fooled
by the flimsy coverup. The international community condemned
the assassination. And the U.S. closed its Dominican embassy and secretly invested 
in the anti-Trujillo movement. Months later, former members 
of the Dominican military killed the dictator, bringing his violent,
31-year reign to an end. Thanks to their family, especially
their surviving sister, Dedé, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters would 
surpass the clutches of Trujillo’s tyranny even long after their deaths. Today, the Mirabal sisters
are national heroes with monuments and honors 
commemorating their struggle. In 1999, the United Nations
declared November 25th, the anniversary of their deaths, the International Day for the Elimination
of Violence Against Women. Their courageous fight for justice
has inspired generations.

**Transcript**:
Let's explore a hypothetical together. There are over four times as
many livestock as people. Farmed cattle alone weigh
nearly ten times as much as all wild mammals combined. So imagine if a wizard of meatless
dining suddenly appeared and with one wave of a wand wiped
away all meat from our shelves— along with any desire to eat it. Farm animals destined for food vanish—
whisked away to another planet. What happens in the following days,
years, and even millennia? Overnight, food related greenhouse gas
emissions drop by about 63%. We no longer get protein
and key nutrients from the approximately
70 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, 300 million cattle, and 200 million tons
of fish and shellfish processed for consumption each year. To help fill this nutritional gap, our demand for fruits, vegetables,
and legumes go up— a diet that most dietitians agree contains
all of the nutrients we need for a healthy life. But initially there aren’t enough
of these foods to go around. The rise in demand causes
produce costs to soar. In regions like Mongolia, where the harsh environment makes
it difficult to grow vegetables, a sudden lack of meat leaves
people with little to eat. Cultures built around meat
lose their foundations. Members of salmon-eating tribes in the
Pacific Northwest of the United States, for example, lose not only
sustenance and livelihoods, but an integral component
of their religion. Tens of millions of anglers lose work
that was already threatened by dwindling fish populations. As the meat industry collapses, many households in developing countries
are left scrambling for income that once came from livestock farming. Some meat producers shift
to agricultural crops, which leave workers—
and neighboring communities— less susceptible to respiratory diseases
associated with livestock production. As crop agriculture expands,
prices come down. Ultimately, vegetarianism becomes less
expensive than meat-eating in most countries. Luckily, we don’t need to clear
new farmland to grow all this food. Without animals raised for meat, land that had been used to grow
feed is now available. All things considered,
our new diets require less land and water. Millions of deaths are avoided every year, thanks in part to lower rates
of heart disease, cancer, and other conditions associated
with red meat consumption. We no longer contract new pathogens
from wild animals hunted for food, or novel influenza viruses
from farmed pigs, or drug-resistant superbugs that develop
in beef cattle that have been preemptively
fed antibiotics. As the years pass,
global biodiversity rises as habitat loss, pesticide use, and other
pressures from agriculture subside. Amazonian birds have more
forest to fly over. Fewer cheetahs are shot for stalking
too close to livestock. Bee, wasp, and butterfly communities
thrive as natural areas expand. In turn, insect-pollinated crops
produce higher yields. Many ocean species rebound
from overfishing. Throughout history,
humans in traditionally vegetarian regions have evolved a genetic mutation that helps them more efficiently
process fats from plants. So over thousands of years, our bodies may evolve to make
the most of our veggies. Or we may lose some adaptations, like the
ability to extract iron from meat. Of course, a wizard will not
turn our world meatless. Though many individuals are choosing
to go vegetarian, globally, meat eating
is still on the rise. This trend spells trouble for our climate. Even if we suddenly stopped burning

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 7
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Let's explore a hypothetical together. There are over four times as
many livestock as people. Farmed cattle alone weigh
nearly ten times as much as all wild mammals combined. So imagine if a wizard of meatless
dining suddenly appeared and with one wave of a wand wiped
away all meat from our shelves— along with any desire to eat it. Farm animals destined for food vanish—
whisked away to another planet. What happens in the following days,
years, and even millennia? Overnight, food related greenhouse gas
emissions drop by about 63%. We no longer get protein
and key nutrients from the approximately
70 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, 300 million cattle, and 200 million tons
of fish and shellfish processed for consumption each year. To help fill this nutritional gap, our demand for fruits, vegetables,
and legumes go up— a diet that most dietitians agree contains
all of the nutrients we need for a healthy life. But initially there aren’t enough
of these foods to go around. The rise in demand causes
produce costs to soar. In regions like Mongolia, where the harsh environment makes
it difficult to grow vegetables, a sudden lack of meat leaves
people with little to eat. Cultures built around meat
lose their foundations. Members of salmon-eating tribes in the
Pacific Northwest of the United States, for example, lose not only
sustenance and livelihoods, but an integral component
of their religion. Tens of millions of anglers lose work
that was already threatened by dwindling fish populations. As the meat industry collapses, many households in developing countries
are left scrambling for income that once came from livestock farming. Some meat producers shift
to agricultural crops, which leave workers—
and neighboring communities— less susceptible to respiratory diseases
associated with livestock production. As crop agriculture expands,
prices come down. Ultimately, vegetarianism becomes less
expensive than meat-eating in most countries. Luckily, we don’t need to clear
new farmland to grow all this food. Without animals raised for meat, land that had been used to grow
feed is now available. All things considered,
our new diets require less land and water. Millions of deaths are avoided every year, thanks in part to lower rates
of heart disease, cancer, and other conditions associated
with red meat consumption. We no longer contract new pathogens
from wild animals hunted for food, or novel influenza viruses
from farmed pigs, or drug-resistant superbugs that develop
in beef cattle that have been preemptively
fed antibiotics. As the years pass,
global biodiversity rises as habitat loss, pesticide use, and other
pressures from agriculture subside. Amazonian birds have more
forest to fly over. Fewer cheetahs are shot for stalking
too close to livestock. Bee, wasp, and butterfly communities
thrive as natural areas expand. In turn, insect-pollinated crops
produce higher yields. Many ocean species rebound
from overfishing. Throughout history,
humans in traditionally vegetarian regions have evolved a genetic mutation that helps them more efficiently
process fats from plants. So over thousands of years, our bodies may evolve to make
the most of our veggies. Or we may lose some adaptations, like the
ability to extract iron from meat. Of course, a wizard will not
turn our world meatless. Though many individuals are choosing
to go vegetarian, globally, meat eating
is still on the rise. This trend spells trouble for our climate. Even if we suddenly stopped burning
fossil fuels, business as usual food systems paired
with a growing population would push global temperatures over 1.5°C

**Transcript**:
In 1944, 11 years before her fateful 
decision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was investigating 
a vicious crime. As an emissary for 
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama 
to meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been 
sexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince
an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend 
Recy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests 
throughout the South. When a jury failed 
to indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor 
assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail
to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice 
for all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly 
challenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems 
protecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her 
mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear 
of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently 
drove past their home, and Jim Crow laws 
segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery
and married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury 
at racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter
of the NAACP; a role many avoided 
for fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager 
to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the
limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined 
the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were 
the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes 
for their meetings, and soon found herself elected 
secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress
to support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented
numerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile
murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public 
responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter,
battling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns 
frequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks 
was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP 
youth group council, she helped young people navigate 
segregated systems including voter registration and 
whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine 
civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience
training and spoke out against racial violence,
particularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move 
to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement 
she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed 
for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four 
hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred 
and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed 
nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended 
when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating 
public transport. But this victory for the movement 
had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death 
threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery
because of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit 
to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman 
John Conyers to help support his burgeoning 
civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial 
inequality, Parks remained active 
for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks
to support other activists, and established an institute 
for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered 
as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful 
people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done
does away with fear.”

civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience
training and spoke out against racial violence,
particularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move 
to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement 
she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed 
for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four 
hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred 
and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed 
nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended 
when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating 
public transport. But this victory for the movement 
had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death 
threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery
because of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit 
to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman 
John Conyers to help support his burgeoning 
civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial 
inequality, Parks remained active 
for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks
to support other activists, and established an institute 
for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered 
as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful 
people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done
does away with fear.”

**Transcript**:
In 1830 at a clothing store
near the Boston Harbor, David Walker carefully stitched
a pamphlet into the lining of a sailor’s coat. The volume was thin enough
to be completely hidden, but its content was 
far from insubstantial. In fact, at the time, many members 
of the US government considered this pamphlet to be one 
of the most dangerous documents in American history. So to ensure this volume
reached his audience, Walker had to hide his work 
in the clothing of both willing co-conspirators 
and unknowing sailors; smuggling the pamphlet 
throughout the country. But what was this incendiary document? 
And who exactly was the man who wrote it? Son of an enslaved father
and a freedwoman, David Walker was born free 
in the late 18th century in Wilmington, North Carolina. From a young age, he sought to extend 
his freedom to all Black Americans, and after moving to Charleston
as a young man, he became closely involved with the
African Methodist Episcopal Church. At that time, the mainstream movement 
to end slavery was comprised of societies led by wealthy white men 
who favored gradual change and avoided confrontation
with slaveholders. But the AME Church practiced
a more radical brand of abolition. In 1822, AME leader Denmark Vesey
planned a major insurrection intended to violently liberate 
Charleston’s enslaved community and set the city ablaze. It’s unclear if Walker contributed
to Vesey’s plan, but he wasn’t among the many AME members
who were arrested and executed for this attempted rebellion. In 1825, Walker surfaced in Boston, where
he rejoined the fight against slavery. In addition to marrying 
fellow activist Eliza Butler and opening his clothing store, Walker helped fund America’s
first Black-owned newspaper. Is passionate articles and public speeches
sought to instill pride and camaraderie into those fighting for Black liberation. But to truly unite free 
and enslaved Black Americans, Walker would have to go beyond Boston. In 1829, he poured his ideas into the “Appeal to the Colored Citizens 
of the World.” This treatise was punctuated
with furious exclamation marks and emphasized the spiritual righteousness
of resistance. He described the suffering of enslaved
people in graphic detail to prove that the reality for Black Americans
was often “kill or be killed.” And given these circumstances, Walker staunchly defended 
the right to militant action. This wasn’t his only departure 
from moderate mainstream abolitionists. To stress the importance
of Black solidarity, Walker connected American abolitionism with global movements 
for Black liberation. He called for an international 
Black freedom struggle in an early display of what would come
to be called Pan-Africanism. But at the same time, 
he opposed the popular movement for Black Americans to emigrate to Africa. While the “Appeal” criticized 
the Founding Fathers for their hypocrisy, Walker insisted that Black people were
essential to the country’s creation, and had an undeniable right
to American citizenship. Walker suspected 
these incendiary arguments would make him a target for violence. But in spite of the danger, he continued 
using sailors to smuggle his work. The “Appeal” traveled down the coast 
into the hands of shopkeepers, church leaders, political organizers, 
and underground abolitionist networks. For these readers, Walker’s words
galvanized militant efforts to overthrow slave owners and its call to arms struck fear
into white officials. Police intercepted its delivery, and quarantined Black sailors
at Southern ports. The pamphlet inspired Louisiana 
to ban anti-slavery literature, and both North and South Carolina 
cracked down on Black education to prevent literacy 
among enslaved peoples. Southern officials even placed 
a bounty on Walker’s head worth the modern equivalent
of $322,000. But while friends urged him to flee,
Walker refused to abandon his cause. Tragically, his bravery 
couldn’t protect him from the deadliest disease of his time. In August 1830, Walker was found dead. And while his associates declared
him the victim of assassination, it’s now widely believed 
that he died from tuberculosis. Following his death, Walker's message
continued to resound. Frederick Douglass credited him 
as the originator of radical abolitionism, and his “Appeal” inspired some 
of the most influential members of the 20th century liberation movement. From Malcolm X’s militant approach
to Black resistance, to James Cone’s writing
on Black spirituality, Walker’s legacy remains
crucially important to the history of Black resistance movements— and their visions for the future.

**Transcript**:
In 1830 at a clothing store
near the Boston Harbor, David Walker carefully stitched
a pamphlet into the lining of a sailor’s coat. The volume was thin enough
to be completely hidden, but its content was 
far from insubstantial. In fact, at the time, many members 
of the US government considered this pamphlet to be one 
of the most dangerous documents in American history. So to ensure this volume
reached his audience, Walker had to hide his work 
in the clothing of both willing co-conspirators 
and unknowing sailors; smuggling the pamphlet 
throughout the country. But what was this incendiary document? 
And who exactly was the man who wrote it? Son of an enslaved father
and a freedwoman, David Walker was born free 
in the late 18th century in Wilmington, North Carolina. From a young age, he sought to extend 
his freedom to all Black Americans, and after moving to Charleston
as a young man, he became closely involved with the
African Methodist Episcopal Church. At that time, the mainstream movement 
to end slavery was comprised of societies led by wealthy white men 
who favored gradual change and avoided confrontation
with slaveholders. But the AME Church practiced
a more radical brand of abolition. In 1822, AME leader Denmark Vesey
planned a major insurrection intended to violently liberate 
Charleston’s enslaved community and set the city ablaze. It’s unclear if Walker contributed
to Vesey’s plan, but he wasn’t among the many AME members
who were arrested and executed for this attempted rebellion. In 1825, Walker surfaced in Boston, where
he rejoined the fight against slavery. In addition to marrying 
fellow activist Eliza Butler and opening his clothing store, Walker helped fund America’s
first Black-owned newspaper. Is passionate articles and public speeches
sought to instill pride and camaraderie into those fighting for Black liberation. But to truly unite free 
and enslaved Black Americans, Walker would have to go beyond Boston. In 1829, he poured his ideas into the “Appeal to the Colored Citizens 
of the World.” This treatise was punctuated
with furious exclamation marks and emphasized the spiritual righteousness
of resistance. He described the suffering of enslaved
people in graphic detail to prove that the reality for Black Americans
was often “kill or be killed.” And given these circumstances, Walker staunchly defended 
the right to militant action. This wasn’t his only departure 
from moderate mainstream abolitionists. To stress the importance
of Black solidarity, Walker connected American abolitionism with global movements 
for Black liberation. He called for an international 
Black freedom struggle in an early display of what would come
to be called Pan-Africanism. But at the same time, 
he opposed the popular movement for Black Americans to emigrate to Africa. While the “Appeal” criticized 
the Founding Fathers for their hypocrisy, Walker insisted that Black people were
essential to the country’s creation, and had an undeniable right
to American citizenship. Walker suspected 
these incendiary arguments would make him a target for violence. But in spite of the danger, he continued 
using sailors to smuggle his work. The “Appeal” traveled down the coast 
into the hands of shopkeepers, church leaders, political organizers, 
and underground abolitionist networks. For these readers, Walker’s words
galvanized militant efforts to overthrow slave owners and its call to arms struck fear
into white officials. Police intercepted its delivery, and quarantined Black sailors
at Southern ports. The pamphlet inspired Louisiana 
to ban anti-slavery literature, and both North and South Carolina 
cracked down on Black education to prevent literacy 
among enslaved peoples. Southern officials even placed 
a bounty on Walker’s head worth the modern equivalent
of $322,000. But while friends urged him to flee,

couldn’t protect him from the deadliest disease of his time. In August 1830, Walker was found dead. And while his associates declared

**Transcript**:
Order! Order! Who’s the defendant today?
Looks pretty fancy. Indeed, Your Honor. This is Marie Antoinette,
the Queen of France who was notorious for living in opulence
while the peasants starved. That is sensationalist slander. Marie Antoinette had little power
over her circumstances and spent her brief life trying to survive
in a turbulent, foreign country. You mean she wasn't French? That’s right, Your Honor. She was born in 1755 as the
Hapsburg Archduchess Maria Antonia. After two of her older sisters
passed away, she became the only choice for a political
marriage to Louis-August, heir to the French throne. Essentially, she was sacrificed to secure
peace between Austria and France, all at the age of 14. She seemed to have had adjusted
to this “sacrifice” by 1774 when her husband was crowned king. She lived a life of luxury, 
wearing elaborate headdresses, importing foreign fabrics— she even had her own private chateau
near Versailles! Meanwhile, France was 
in an economic tailspin. Bad harvests resulted
in mass food shortages, wages were falling,
and the cost of living had skyrocketed. Marie Antoinette’s expensive tastes
were completely insensitive to the plight of her subjects. She was the Queen! If she hadn’t looked glamorous,
she would have been criticized. Besides, she sometimes used
her image for good. After convincing the King to be
vaccinated against smallpox, she commissioned a special headdress
to make the treatment fashionable for all. She also used her influence to appoint
unqualified friends and admirers to important posts. Even more disastrous, she encouraged
the King to get involved in the American Revolution, a conflict that cost France
1.5 billion francs. Objection! The Queen had very little influence over
her husband’s political decisions at that time. Besides, France’s financial crisis was
much more related to the country’s outdated tax system and lack
of an effective central bank. How so? While France's nobility and clergy
had numerous tax exemptions, peasants often paid more than half
their income in taxes. This system buried France in debt
long before the Queen's arrival. Her personal expenses were
merely a scapegoat for decades of financial negligence. That doesn’t change that Marie Antoinette
spent tax money on luxuries while the masses starved! She was so oblivious that when she heard
people couldn’t afford bread, she recommended they eat cake instead. This is almost certainly a fabrication
attributed to the Queen by her enemies. In fact, Marie Antoinette frequently
engaged in charity work focused on addressing poverty. Her reputation as a heartless queen
was based on rumors and slander. Even the most famous case against her
was a complete fraud. Pardon? In 1784, a thief forged fake letters
from the Queen to purchase an outrageously expensive
diamond necklace. The truth came out eventually, but the public already saw
her as a wasteful spendthrift. Meanwhile, it's really her husband
who ruined France's finances. On that, we agree. Louis XVI was an incompetent king. Even after the revolution began
and he lost much of his power to the newly formed National Assembly, he refused to yield control. Louis vetoed numerous pieces
of legislation— and he was supported 
by his conservative Queen. To a point. Marie Antoinette believed
in the divine right of kings, but despite personal reservations,
she tried to work with reformers. Though all she got in return were false
reports that she was sleeping with them. No amount of charity work could counter
this avalanche of slander. The revolutionaries also prevented
the King’s family from leaving Paris— how could she negotiate with people
keeping her prisoner? Well, they were right to do so! In 1791, the royal couple tried
fleeing to Austria to gather support and regain power. Even after they were caught, the King and Queen continued
to pass military secrets to their Austrian contacts. Isn't that treason? Certainly, and Louis was executed for it,
alongside 32 other charges. Even if you believe the King's
execution was just, there's no excuse for how the new
government treated Marie Antoinette. She was separated from her son
and kept in a cell with no privacy. The tribunal in charge of prosecuting 
the Queen had no proof of her treason, so they denigrated her with baseless
accusations of incest and orgies. Yet she maintained composure
until the very end. The Queen’s final words were an apology
to her executioner for stepping on his foot. However refined she may have been, Marie Antoinette was willing to betray
her country to stay in power. In life and death, she remains a symbol
of everything wrong with the decadent monarchy. A convenient symbol— and an example of the public’s appetite
for smearing prominent women with their own fantasies and frustrations. So what you’re saying is she
was guilty of being Queen? Should monarchs be judged 
by their personal qualities or the historical role they occupied? And can even the powerful be
victims of circumstance? These are the questions that arise
when we put history on trial.

keeping her prisoner? Well, they were right to do so! In 1791, the royal couple tried
fleeing to Austria to gather support and regain power. Even after they were caught, the King and Queen continued
to pass military secrets to their Austrian contacts. Isn't that treason? Certainly, and Louis was executed for it,
alongside 32 other charges. Even if you believe the King's
execution was just, there's no excuse for how the new
government treated Marie Antoinette. She was separated from her son
and kept in a cell with no privacy. The tribunal in charge of prosecuting 
the Queen had no proof of her treason, so they denigrated her with baseless
accusations of incest and orgies. Yet she maintained composure
until the very end. The Queen’s final words were an apology
to her executioner for stepping on his foot. However refined she may have been, Marie Antoinette was willing to betray
her country to stay in power. In life and death, she remains a symbol
of everything wrong with the decadent monarchy. A convenient symbol— and an example of the public’s appetite
for smearing prominent women with their own fantasies and frustrations. So what you’re saying is she
was guilty of being Queen? Should monarchs be judged 
by their personal qualities or the historical role they occupied? And can even the powerful be
victims of circumstance? These are the questions that arise
when we put history on trial.

**Transcript**:
Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life.

**Transcript**:
Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life.

**Transcript**:
In the grasslands of Mauritania, a gazelle suffering from tuberculosis 
takes its last breath. Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse 
threatens to infect the water. But for the desert’s cleanup crew, 
this body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast. Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan 
of nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture 
is the undisputed king of the carcass. This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide 
and muscle tissue, opening entry points 
for weaker vultures to dig in. This colossal competition is too dangerous
for the tiny Egyptian vulture. With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa 
from his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft 
for hours at a time. But upon arrival, he finds himself near 
the bottom of the pecking order. Fortunately, what he lacks in size, 
he makes up for in intelligence. A short distance away, 
he spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs. Using a large rock, he smashes one open
for a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle 
once the larger birds are gone. High above the commotion 
are Ruppell’s Griffon vultures. Soaring at an altitude 
of over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher 
than any other animal. At this height, they can’t see 
individual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures 
guides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature 
as they descend— and keep them clean 
as they tear into the decaying gazelle. The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat 
infects the water supply. And the tuberculosis doesn’t 
stand a chance at infecting the vultures. These birds have evolved the lowest 
gastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased 
carrion and waste without becoming sick. In fact, species like 
the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones 
in just 24 hours. This adaptation helps smaller vultures 
supplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume 
diseased meat up to 3 days old. Their acidic stomachs protect them 
from living animals too: their rancid vomit 
scares off most predators. These stomachs of steel are essential 
to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies 
from the African ecosystem. But while vultures can easily digest 
natural waste, man-made chemicals are another story. Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug 
used to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures. And because local religious beliefs 
prohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses. Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons
and habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline 
in the region’s vulture population. In nearby Africa, 
poachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from 
alerting authorities to their location. One poisoned carcass can kill 
over 500 vultures. Today, more than 50% of all vulture 
species are endangered. In regions where vultures 
have gone extinct, corpses take three times longer to decay. These carcasses contaminate 
drinking water, while feral dogs and rats carry 
the diseases into human communities. The Asian and African Vulture Crisis 
has led to an epidemic of rabies in India, where infections kill roughly 
20,000 people each year. Fortunately, some communities have already
realized how important vultures are. Conservationists have successfully banned
drugs like Diclofenac, while other researchers are working 
to repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs. Some regions have even opened 
vulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose 
of drug-free livestock. With help, vultures will be able 
to continue their role conserving the health of our planet—
transforming death and decay into life.

**Transcript**:
In the grasslands of Mauritania, a gazelle suffering from tuberculosis 
takes its last breath. Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse 
threatens to infect the water. But for the desert’s cleanup crew, 
this body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast. Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan 
of nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture 
is the undisputed king of the carcass. This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide 
and muscle tissue, opening entry points 
for weaker vultures to dig in. This colossal competition is too dangerous
for the tiny Egyptian vulture. With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa 
from his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft 
for hours at a time. But upon arrival, he finds himself near 
the bottom of the pecking order. Fortunately, what he lacks in size, 
he makes up for in intelligence. A short distance away, 
he spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs. Using a large rock, he smashes one open
for a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle 
once the larger birds are gone. High above the commotion 
are Ruppell’s Griffon vultures. Soaring at an altitude 
of over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher 
than any other animal. At this height, they can’t see 
individual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures 
guides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature 
as they descend— and keep them clean 
as they tear into the decaying gazelle. The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat 
infects the water supply. And the tuberculosis doesn’t 
stand a chance at infecting the vultures. These birds have evolved the lowest 
gastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased 
carrion and waste without becoming sick. In fact, species like 
the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones 
in just 24 hours. This adaptation helps smaller vultures 
supplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume 
diseased meat up to 3 days old. Their acidic stomachs protect them 
from living animals too: their rancid vomit 
scares off most predators. These stomachs of steel are essential 
to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies 
from the African ecosystem. But while vultures can easily digest 
natural waste, man-made chemicals are another story. Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug 
used to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures. And because local religious beliefs 
prohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses. Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons
and habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline 
in the region’s vulture population. In nearby Africa, 
poachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from 
alerting authorities to their location. One poisoned carcass can kill 
over 500 vultures. Today, more than 50% of all vulture 
species are endangered. In regions where vultures 
have gone extinct, corpses take three times longer to decay. These carcasses contaminate 
drinking water, while feral dogs and rats carry 
the diseases into human communities. The Asian and African Vulture Crisis 
has led to an epidemic of rabies in India, where infections kill roughly 
20,000 people each year. Fortunately, some communities have already
realized how important vultures are. Conservationists have successfully banned
drugs like Diclofenac, while other researchers are working 
to repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs. Some regions have even opened 
vulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose 
of drug-free livestock. With help, vultures will be able 
to continue their role conserving the health of our planet—
transforming death and decay into life.

**Transcript**:
Lord Sun dawns on the day called 7-Monkey, his fingers slowly spreading a rosy sheen that mixes softly with smoke rising 
from Tenochtitlan’s many hearth fires. The midwife, Xoquauhtli, 
has a difficult choice to make. A momentous shift from rainy season 
to dry season is underway. All summer, the gods have kept 
the people fed with corn, but the fertile summer months 
are disappearing. This day occurs during the festival 
that marks the shift between the summer season,
when the gods feed the people, and the winter season,
when the people feed the gods in return. Xoquauhtli owes a debt 
to her patron, Teteoinnan, the female warrior goddess 
at the center of this festival. Teteoinnan wages war both 
on women’s battlefields of birth and in men’s battles 
with Tenochtilan’s enemies. She must be kept happy 
or she will bring bad luck. The midwife should participate 
in the festival today, but one of her patients could 
go into labor any minute. Xoquauhtli decides to check 
on her patient first. The expecting mother hasn’t 
worked too hard, chewed gum, or lifted heavy things. Her family is taking good care of her. Surely Xoquauhtli can take a little time 
to honor her goddess. She leaves her apprentice in charge 
and heads to the center of the city. Along the way, she sees women sweeping
the roads and hanging gourds in preparation for the festival. Finally, she reaches the Great Pyramid. On top are two temples: the north, where rituals honor 
the rain god in the summer, and the south one is where rituals 
honor the war god in the winter. On the equinox, the sun rises 
between the two sides. The ceremony begins with a mock battle 
between the midwives and the other physicians. Xoquauhtli’s team battles heartily, 
throwing nochtles, marigolds, and balls made of reed and moss. They joke, call their rivals names, 
and laugh. But then, a girl comes running 
with a message for Xoquauhtli. Her patient is in labor! She hurries back to the house. All the old women 
from the extended family have already gathered for the birth— their experience is very valuable 
if anything goes wrong. She readies herself with a prayer praising
her most important tools, her fingers. Then she doses the patient with cihuapatli
to help expel the baby, massages her in the sweathouse, 
and rubs her stomach with tobacco. Offering Teteoinnan a short prayer, she urges her patient 
to act like a warrior. A strong baby girl slips 
into her waiting hands and the old women shout triumphant cries. Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water 
from a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. She calls her a precious greenstone, 
a little warrior, and tells her how the Lord and Lady 
of the Ninth Sky breathed life into her, sending her 
to this place of burden and torment. She then turns to the new mother, 
praising her, telling her she acted like 
an eagle warrior, a jaguar warrior. By the time they finish, it’s late, 
and the flames of the fire have died down. Xoquauhtli piles the remaining hot coals 
in the center of the hearth, stoking them to keep them going. She lays the baby in a woven basket, 
head facing the warming fire. This will warm her tonalli, 
an important “soul” center in the body central to health and well-being. It’s almost midnight— 
if Xoquauhtli hurries, she can get back to the temple 
for the culmination of the festival. She makes her way to the city center, 
where a priest carries a woman on his back to the top of the pyramid. To begin the new season and feed the gods,
she will be beheaded, symbolizing how corn is cut in the fields. Afterward, she will be reborn 
as Lady Teteoinnan, and preside over the induction 
of new warriors.

**Transcript**:
Lord Sun dawns on the day called 7-Monkey, his fingers slowly spreading a rosy sheen that mixes softly with smoke rising 
from Tenochtitlan’s many hearth fires. The midwife, Xoquauhtli, 
has a difficult choice to make. A momentous shift from rainy season 
to dry season is underway. All summer, the gods have kept 
the people fed with corn, but the fertile summer months 
are disappearing. This day occurs during the festival 
that marks the shift between the summer season,
when the gods feed the people, and the winter season,
when the people feed the gods in return. Xoquauhtli owes a debt 
to her patron, Teteoinnan, the female warrior goddess 
at the center of this festival. Teteoinnan wages war both 
on women’s battlefields of birth and in men’s battles 
with Tenochtilan’s enemies. She must be kept happy 
or she will bring bad luck. The midwife should participate 
in the festival today, but one of her patients could 
go into labor any minute. Xoquauhtli decides to check 
on her patient first. The expecting mother hasn’t 
worked too hard, chewed gum, or lifted heavy things. Her family is taking good care of her. Surely Xoquauhtli can take a little time 
to honor her goddess. She leaves her apprentice in charge 
and heads to the center of the city. Along the way, she sees women sweeping
the roads and hanging gourds in preparation for the festival. Finally, she reaches the Great Pyramid. On top are two temples: the north, where rituals honor 
the rain god in the summer, and the south one is where rituals 
honor the war god in the winter. On the equinox, the sun rises 
between the two sides. The ceremony begins with a mock battle 
between the midwives and the other physicians. Xoquauhtli’s team battles heartily, 
throwing nochtles, marigolds, and balls made of reed and moss. They joke, call their rivals names, 
and laugh. But then, a girl comes running 
with a message for Xoquauhtli. Her patient is in labor! She hurries back to the house. All the old women 
from the extended family have already gathered for the birth— their experience is very valuable 
if anything goes wrong. She readies herself with a prayer praising
her most important tools, her fingers. Then she doses the patient with cihuapatli
to help expel the baby, massages her in the sweathouse, 
and rubs her stomach with tobacco. Offering Teteoinnan a short prayer, she urges her patient 
to act like a warrior. A strong baby girl slips 
into her waiting hands and the old women shout triumphant cries. Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water 
from a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. She calls her a precious greenstone, 
a little warrior, and tells her how the Lord and Lady 
of the Ninth Sky breathed life into her, sending her 
to this place of burden and torment. She then turns to the new mother, 
praising her, telling her she acted like 
an eagle warrior, a jaguar warrior. By the time they finish, it’s late, 
and the flames of the fire have died down. Xoquauhtli piles the remaining hot coals 
in the center of the hearth, stoking them to keep them going. She lays the baby in a woven basket, 
head facing the warming fire. This will warm her tonalli, 
an important “soul” center in the body central to health and well-being. It’s almost midnight— 
if Xoquauhtli hurries, she can get back to the temple 
for the culmination of the festival. She makes her way to the city center, 
where a priest carries a woman on his back to the top of the pyramid. To begin the new season and feed the gods,
she will be beheaded, symbolizing how corn is cut in the fields. Afterward, she will be reborn 
as Lady Teteoinnan, and preside over the induction 
of new warriors.

Reviewer: Mirjana Čutura About 10,000 years ago,
humans began to farm. This agricultural revolution
was a turning point in our history that enabled people to settle,
build and create. In short, agriculture
enabled the existence of civilization. Today, approximately 40 percent
of our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands
are the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed
every member of a growing population a healthy diet? Meeting this goal will require nothing short of a second
agricultural revolution. The first agricultural revolution was characterized
by expansion and exploitation, feeding people at the expense
of forests, wildlife and water and destabilizing the climate
in the process. That's not an option the next time around. Agriculture depends on a stable climate with predictable seasons
and weather patterns. This means we can't keep
expanding our agricultural lands, because doing so will undermine
the environmental conditions that make agriculture possible
in the first place. Instead, the next agricultural revolution will have to increase the output
of our existing farmland for the long term while protecting biodiversity,
conserving water and reducing pollution
and greenhouse gas emissions. So what will the future farms look like? This drone is part of a fleet
that monitors the crops below. The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered
use of the land that intertwines crops and livestock
with wild habitats. Conventional farming methods
cleared large swathes of land and planted them with a single crop, eradicating wildlife and emitting huge amounts
of greenhouse gases in the process. This approach aims to correct that damage. Meanwhile, moving among the crops, teams of field robots
apply fertilizer in targeted doses. Inside the soil, hundreds of sensors gather data
on nutrients and water levels. This information reduces
unnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply
more and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution
by showering it across the whole farm. But the farms of the future
won't be all sensors and robots. These technologies are designed
to help us produce food in a way that works with the environment rather than against it, taking into account
the nuances of local ecosystems. Lower-cost agricultural practices
can also serve those same goals and are much more accessible
to many farmers. In fact, many such practices
are already in use today and stand to have
an increasingly large impact as more farmers adopt them. In Costa Rica, farmers have intertwined farmland
with tropical habitat so successfully that they have significantly contributed
to doubling the country's forest cover. This provides food
and habitat for wildlife as well as natural pollination
and pest control from the birds and insects
these farms attract, producing food while restoring the planet. In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle
on grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon
and protect biodiversity. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease
greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Rice is a staple food
for three billion people and the main source of livelihood
for millions of households. More than 90 percent of rice
is grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent
of annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas
emissions globally. By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive
ways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased
their incomes and crop yields while cutting down
on greenhouse gas emissions. In Zambia, numerous organizations
are investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production,
reduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers. These efforts are projected
to increase crop yield by almost a quarter
over the next few decades. If combined with methods
to combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused
agricultural sector. And in India, where up to 40 percent
of post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement
solar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers
preserve their produce and become a viable part
of the supply chain. It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech
to the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming. High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented
approaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest
in implementing these technologies. Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access
to the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers. This vision of future farming
will also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions
in food loss and waste, both of which will reduce
pressure on the land and allow farmers to do more
with what they have available. If we optimize food production,
both on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental
limits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented
global cooperation and coordination of the agricultural
lands we have today.

Reviewer: Mirjana Čutura About 10,000 years ago,
humans began to farm. This agricultural revolution
was a turning point in our history that enabled people to settle,
build and create. In short, agriculture
enabled the existence of civilization. Today, approximately 40 percent
of our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands
are the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed
every member of a growing population a healthy diet? Meeting this goal will require nothing short of a second
agricultural revolution. The first agricultural revolution was characterized
by expansion and exploitation, feeding people at the expense
of forests, wildlife and water and destabilizing the climate
in the process. That's not an option the next time around. Agriculture depends on a stable climate with predictable seasons
and weather patterns. This means we can't keep
expanding our agricultural lands, because doing so will undermine
the environmental conditions that make agriculture possible
in the first place. Instead, the next agricultural revolution will have to increase the output
of our existing farmland for the long term while protecting biodiversity,
conserving water and reducing pollution
and greenhouse gas emissions. So what will the future farms look like? This drone is part of a fleet
that monitors the crops below. The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered
use of the land that intertwines crops and livestock
with wild habitats. Conventional farming methods
cleared large swathes of land and planted them with a single crop, eradicating wildlife and emitting huge amounts
of greenhouse gases in the process. This approach aims to correct that damage. Meanwhile, moving among the crops, teams of field robots
apply fertilizer in targeted doses. Inside the soil, hundreds of sensors gather data
on nutrients and water levels. This information reduces
unnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply
more and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution
by showering it across the whole farm. But the farms of the future
won't be all sensors and robots. These technologies are designed
to help us produce food in a way that works with the environment rather than against it, taking into account
the nuances of local ecosystems. Lower-cost agricultural practices
can also serve those same goals and are much more accessible
to many farmers. In fact, many such practices
are already in use today and stand to have
an increasingly large impact as more farmers adopt them. In Costa Rica, farmers have intertwined farmland
with tropical habitat so successfully that they have significantly contributed
to doubling the country's forest cover. This provides food
and habitat for wildlife as well as natural pollination
and pest control from the birds and insects
these farms attract, producing food while restoring the planet. In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle
on grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon
and protect biodiversity. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease
greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Rice is a staple food
for three billion people and the main source of livelihood
for millions of households. More than 90 percent of rice
is grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent
of annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas
emissions globally. By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive
ways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased
their incomes and crop yields while cutting down
on greenhouse gas emissions. In Zambia, numerous organizations
are investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production,
reduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers. These efforts are projected
to increase crop yield by almost a quarter
over the next few decades. If combined with methods
to combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused
agricultural sector. And in India, where up to 40 percent
of post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement
solar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers
preserve their produce and become a viable part
of the supply chain. It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech
to the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming. High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented
approaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest
in implementing these technologies. Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access
to the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers. This vision of future farming
will also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions
in food loss and waste, both of which will reduce
pressure on the land and allow farmers to do more
with what they have available. If we optimize food production,
both on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental
limits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented
global cooperation and coordination of the agricultural
lands we have today.

**Transcript**:
At this very moment, almost everything 
around you is being eaten. Invisible to the naked eye, organisms 
called microbes swarm every surface. Hordes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi 
have evolved to produce powerful enzymes that break down tough organic material 
into digestible nutrients. But there’s one particularly widespread 
type of material that almost no microbes can biodegrade: plastics. To make most plastics, molecules 
from oil, gas and coal are refined and turned into long, repeating chains 
called polymers. This process often requires temperatures 
above 100˚C, incredibly high pressure, and various chemical modifications. The resulting man-made polymers 
are quite different from the polymers found in nature. And since they’ve only been 
around since the 1950s, most microbes haven’t had time to evolve 
enzymes to digest them. Making matters even more difficult, breaking most plastics’ chemical bonds 
requires high temperatures comparable to those used to create them— and such heat is deadly to most microbes. This means that most plastics 
never biologically degrade— they just turn into countless, tiny, 
indigestible pieces. And pieces from the most common plastics 
like Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyester-terephthalate
have been piling up for decades. Each year humanity produces roughly 
400 million more tons of plastic, 80% of which is discarded as trash. Of that plastic waste, 
only 10% is recycled. 60% gets incinerated 
or goes into the landfills, and 30% leaks out into the environment where it will pollute natural ecosystems 
for centuries. An estimated 10 million tons of plastic 
waste end up in the ocean each year, mostly in the form of microplastic 
fragments that pollute the food chain. Fortunately, there are microbes 
that may be able to take a bite out of this 
growing problem. In 2016, a team of Japanese researchers 
sampling sludge at a plastic-bottle recycling plant 
discovered Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This never-before-identified bacterium 
contained two enzymes capable of slowly breaking 
down PET polymers at relatively low temperatures. Researchers isolated the genes coding 
for these plastic-digesting enzymes, allowing other bioengineers to combine 
and improve the pair— creating super-enzymes that could break 
down PET up to 6 times faster. Even with this boost, these lab-grown enzymes still took weeks 
to degrade a thin film of PET, and they operated best at temperatures 
below 40˚C. However, another group of scientists 
in Japan had been researching bacterial enzymes adapted 
to high temperature environments like compost piles. And within one particularly warm pile 
of rotting leaves and branches, they found gene sequences 
for powerful degrading enzymes known as Leaf Branch Compost Cutinases. Using fast-growing microorganisms, other researchers were able 
to genetically engineer high quantities of these enzymes. They then enhanced and selected 
special variants of the Cutinases that could degrade PET plastic 
in environments reaching 70˚C— a high temperature that can weaken 
PET polymers and make them digestible. With the help of these 
and other tiny diehards, the future of PET recycling 
looks promising. But PET is just one type of plastic. We still need ways to biologically degrade
all the other types, including abundant PEs and PPs which only begin breaking down 
at temperatures well above 130˚C. Researchers don’t currently know 
of any microbes or enzymes tough enough to tolerate 
such temperatures. So for now, the main way we deal 
with these plastics is through energy-intensive physical 
and chemical processes. Today only a small fraction 
of plasticwaste can be biologically degraded by microbes. Researchers are looking for more 
heat-tolerant plastivores in the planet’s most hostile environments and engineering better 
plastivorous enzymes in the lab. But we can’t rely solely on these tiny 
helpers to clean up our enormous mess. We need to completely rethink 
our relationship with plastics, make better use of existing plastics, and stopproducing more of the same. And we urgently need to design more 
environmentally friendly types of polymers that our growing entourage of plastivores 
can easily break down.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Plastics don’t easily break down biologically into nutrients because:
Options: A. Most naturally occurring microbes haven’t evolved the ability to biodegrade and compost plastics into useable nutrients., B. Most plastics are made from cellulose and lignin which microbes cannot digest., C. Plastic polymers require low temperatures and pressures to break down which are lethal to most biological organisms., D. Plastics aren’t made from carbon chains and therefore have no nutrients to offer.
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main reason why most microbes cannot biodegrade plastics?
Options: A. Plastics are made from natural materials that are difficult to break down., B. Plastics have only been around since the 1950s, and most microbes haven't had time to evolve enzymes to digest them., C. Plastics are too large for microbes to consume., D. Plastics are too small for microbes to consume.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
At this very moment, almost everything 
around you is being eaten. Invisible to the naked eye, organisms 
called microbes swarm every surface. Hordes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi 
have evolved to produce powerful enzymes that break down tough organic material 
into digestible nutrients. But there’s one particularly widespread 
type of material that almost no microbes can biodegrade: plastics. To make most plastics, molecules 
from oil, gas and coal are refined and turned into long, repeating chains 
called polymers. This process often requires temperatures 
above 100˚C, incredibly high pressure, and various chemical modifications. The resulting man-made polymers 
are quite different from the polymers found in nature. And since they’ve only been 
around since the 1950s, most microbes haven’t had time to evolve 
enzymes to digest them. Making matters even more difficult, breaking most plastics’ chemical bonds 
requires high temperatures comparable to those used to create them— and such heat is deadly to most microbes. This means that most plastics 
never biologically degrade— they just turn into countless, tiny, 
indigestible pieces. And pieces from the most common plastics 
like Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyester-terephthalate
have been piling up for decades. Each year humanity produces roughly 
400 million more tons of plastic, 80% of which is discarded as trash. Of that plastic waste, 
only 10% is recycled. 60% gets incinerated 
or goes into the landfills, and 30% leaks out into the environment where it will pollute natural ecosystems 
for centuries. An estimated 10 million tons of plastic 
waste end up in the ocean each year, mostly in the form of microplastic 
fragments that pollute the food chain. Fortunately, there are microbes 
that may be able to take a bite out of this 
growing problem. In 2016, a team of Japanese researchers 
sampling sludge at a plastic-bottle recycling plant 
discovered Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This never-before-identified bacterium 
contained two enzymes capable of slowly breaking 
down PET polymers at relatively low temperatures. Researchers isolated the genes coding 
for these plastic-digesting enzymes, allowing other bioengineers to combine 
and improve the pair— creating super-enzymes that could break 
down PET up to 6 times faster. Even with this boost, these lab-grown enzymes still took weeks 
to degrade a thin film of PET, and they operated best at temperatures 
below 40˚C. However, another group of scientists 
in Japan had been researching bacterial enzymes adapted 
to high temperature environments like compost piles. And within one particularly warm pile 
of rotting leaves and branches, they found gene sequences 
for powerful degrading enzymes known as Leaf Branch Compost Cutinases. Using fast-growing microorganisms, other researchers were able 
to genetically engineer high quantities of these enzymes. They then enhanced and selected 
special variants of the Cutinases that could degrade PET plastic 
in environments reaching 70˚C— a high temperature that can weaken 
PET polymers and make them digestible. With the help of these 
and other tiny diehards, the future of PET recycling 
looks promising. But PET is just one type of plastic. We still need ways to biologically degrade
all the other types, including abundant PEs and PPs which only begin breaking down 
at temperatures well above 130˚C. Researchers don’t currently know 
of any microbes or enzymes tough enough to tolerate 
such temperatures. So for now, the main way we deal 
with these plastics is through energy-intensive physical 
and chemical processes. Today only a small fraction 
of plasticwaste can be biologically degraded by microbes. Researchers are looking for more 
heat-tolerant plastivores in the planet’s most hostile environments and engineering better 
plastivorous enzymes in the lab. But we can’t rely solely on these tiny 
helpers to clean up our enormous mess. We need to completely rethink 
our relationship with plastics, make better use of existing plastics, and stopproducing more of the same. And we urgently need to design more 
environmentally friendly types of polymers that our growing entourage of plastivores 
can easily break down.

**Transcript**:
Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil,
slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer 
of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience. Historically, the union between 
Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium 
between thought and action on which the well-being 
of the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of energy, 
growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, 
and the world would remain static. But together, the two formed 
a divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection 
to all living things. For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped
far and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart 
to Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants
were bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet a rift had grown 
between these two formidable forces. While Parvati sustained daily life 
with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle 
his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling 
about their roles in the universe. He believed that Brahma, 
the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane 
purely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things 
were merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. For millennia Parvati 
had merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed 
the things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove 
the importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy
that kept the Earth turning. At her disappearance, a sudden, 
terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, 
the land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank 
and crops shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity. Parents struggled to console 
their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled. With nothing to eat, people no longer
gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank 
from the darkening world. To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness
left by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune
to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt 
bottomless and unbearable. As Shiva despaired 
over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that 
the material world could not be so easily dismissed. At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati 
could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To walk among them 
and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge 
and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, 
the Goddess of food. With the arrival of Annapurna, 
the world blossomed anew. People rejoiced at fertility and food, 
and communed together to give thanks. Some believe that Annapurna first appeared
in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, 
on the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen 
to fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more. But it was not only mere mortals 
who were served at her feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure
blooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess
with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For this reason, the supreme deity 
is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand,
while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, 
this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world 
is anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life 
that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths 
and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth.

while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, 
this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world 
is anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life 
that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths 
and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth.

**Transcript**:
In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with 
his latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake 
occurred in their kingdom– including the direction 
they should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came 
for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to 
identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique
challenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so 
hard to anticipate, and how could we get better 
at predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories 
behind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten
layer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to 
spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 
centimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful 
enough to cause deep cracks in the
interacting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may 
ultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into 
seismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker–
under pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to
friction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks
moving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables 
should we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our 
growing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur 
at largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates 
is somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues 
come from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions 
about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict 
very loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the 
vibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are 
also capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially 
crowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts 
people to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able
to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings 
would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck 
the east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly 
high concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: 
radon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right 
before an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built 
a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising 
warning system– potentially predicting quakes 
a week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies 
would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside 
the earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale 
geological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands 
of lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare 
and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions 
from a vase.

**Transcript**:
In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with 
his latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake 
occurred in their kingdom– including the direction 
they should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came 
for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to 
identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique
challenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so 
hard to anticipate, and how could we get better 
at predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories 
behind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten
layer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to 
spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 
centimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful 
enough to cause deep cracks in the
interacting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may 
ultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into 
seismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker–
under pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to
friction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks
moving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables 
should we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our 
growing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur 
at largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates 
is somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues 
come from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions 
about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict 
very loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the 
vibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are 
also capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially 
crowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts 
people to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able
to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings 
would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck 
the east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly 
high concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: 
radon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right 
before an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built 
a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising 
warning system– potentially predicting quakes 
a week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies 
would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside 
the earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale 
geological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands 
of lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare 
and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions 
from a vase.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1953, a tidal surge 
shook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded 
the Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm 
threatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands 
were ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors 
activated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms 
swung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm 
with the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed 
with minimal flooding. The first field activation 
of the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile 
structures, this storm surge barrier 
is a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part
of a massive, interlocking system of water controls 
known as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention 
project in the world. The Netherlands has a long history 
with water management. The country lies along the delta 
of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory 
is below sea level. This geography makes the region 
extremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest 
Dutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that 
coordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch
government took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting 
the entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds 
of flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe
as the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required
various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam 
the region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of 
the country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed 
flood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta 
Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve 
as nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work 
for the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping 
industry, this passage had to be kept open 
in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible 
protection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, 
like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk 
of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on 
holding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, 
the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works 
and protect against floods further inland. Under the "Room for the River" plan, farms and dikes were relocated 
away from the shore. This left more space for water 
to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats 
for local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only 
decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped 
settlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' 
multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city 
almost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts 
are protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts 
have been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs 
that store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city 
transform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters 
and sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating 
pavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned 
amphibious structures, some of which house water purification
systems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some 
of the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands 
at the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways 
to make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels 
caused by climate change threaten low-lying cities 
across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional 
example of how to go with the flow.

extremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest 
Dutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that 
coordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch
government took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting 
the entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds 
of flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe
as the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required
various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam 
the region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of 
the country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed 
flood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta 
Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve 
as nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work 
for the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping 
industry, this passage had to be kept open 
in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible 
protection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, 
like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk 
of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on 
holding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, 
the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works 
and protect against floods further inland. Under the "Room for the River" plan, farms and dikes were relocated 
away from the shore. This left more space for water 
to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats 
for local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only 
decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped 
settlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' 
multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city 
almost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts 
are protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts 
have been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs 
that store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city 
transform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters 
and sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating 
pavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned 
amphibious structures, some of which house water purification
systems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some 
of the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands 
at the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways 
to make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels 
caused by climate change threaten low-lying cities 
across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional 
example of how to go with the flow.

**Transcript**:
In January of 1953, a tidal surge 
shook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded 
the Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm 
threatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands 
were ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors 
activated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms 
swung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm 
with the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed 
with minimal flooding. The first field activation 
of the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile 
structures, this storm surge barrier 
is a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part
of a massive, interlocking system of water controls 
known as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention 
project in the world. The Netherlands has a long history 
with water management. The country lies along the delta 
of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory 
is below sea level. This geography makes the region 
extremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest

**Transcript**:
In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission
to take over Eurasia, swiftly conquering countries and drawing 
them into his expanding Mongol Empire. With his vast armies he became almost 
unstoppable. But, legend has it that there was 
one obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t 
overcome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from 
invading their territory. No one knows how historically accurate 
that particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram 
and Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers 
and using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating 
phenomenon, it’s important to understand the 
difference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and 
accumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the 
stacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, 
summer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, 
and centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted 
glacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great 
mountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for
centuries that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different 
genders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers
by grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and 
female glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, 
wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully 
active glaciers that grow each year with 
additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting 
reserves of water that farmers can use 
to irrigate their crops. These practices have spread 
to other cultures, where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious 
modern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region
in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the 
Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten 
centimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because 
of climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing 
their own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: 
horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when 
farmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series
of basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of 
water into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin 
with another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with 
irrigation for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using 
the meltwater from already-existing glaciers 
high above their villages. The meltwater enters channels 
that run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing
straight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs 
out of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice 
sculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount
of surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water 
to feed the farmers’ crops. These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own
glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier 
growing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 
in the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in 
villages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness
our homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s
harshest landscapes.

**Transcript**:
In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission
to take over Eurasia, swiftly conquering countries and drawing 
them into his expanding Mongol Empire. With his vast armies he became almost 
unstoppable. But, legend has it that there was 
one obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t 
overcome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from 
invading their territory. No one knows how historically accurate 
that particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram 
and Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers 
and using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating 
phenomenon, it’s important to understand the 
difference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and 
accumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the 
stacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, 
summer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, 
and centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted 
glacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great 
mountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for
centuries that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different 
genders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers
by grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and 
female glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, 
wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully 
active glaciers that grow each year with 
additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting 
reserves of water that farmers can use 
to irrigate their crops. These practices have spread 
to other cultures, where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious 
modern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region
in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the 
Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten 
centimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because 
of climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing 
their own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: 
horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when 
farmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series
of basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of 
water into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin 
with another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with 
irrigation for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using 
the meltwater from already-existing glaciers 
high above their villages. The meltwater enters channels 
that run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing
straight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs 
out of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice 
sculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount
of surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water 
to feed the farmers’ crops. These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own
glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier 
growing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 
in the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in 
villages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness
our homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s

**Transcript**:
You’ve filled up your cart and made 
it to the front of the grocery line when you’re confronted 
with yet another choice: what kind of bag should you use? If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags
strewn across the ocean, it might seem obvious that plastic 
is bad for the environment. Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote
would be the better option. But is that really true? Each of these three materials 
has a unique environmental impact that’s determined by its carbon footprint, its potential to be reused and recycled,
and its degradability. So, to get the full story 
on these grocery bags we need to look at how they’re made, how they’re used, 
and where they ultimately go. Let’s start with plastic. The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag 
is made of high-density polyethylene, commonly known as HDPE. Producing this material requires
extracting petroleum from the ground and applying extreme heat. The resulting polymer resin 
is then transported alongside additional ingredients 
like titanium oxide and chalk to a bag manufacturing plant. Here, coal powered machines 
melt the materials down and spin them into sheets of plastic, which are then folded into bags. By the time a bag reaches
its final destination, it’s contributed an estimated 1.6 kg
of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the same amount of carbon
a car produces, driving a little over 6 kilometers. But the alternatives actually possess
a much larger carbon footprint. Paper is made from wood pulp, and when you account for the carbon cost
of removing trees from their ecosystems, a single paper bag can be responsible
for about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely
energy and water intensive process. The production of a single cotton tote emits an estimated 272 kg
of carbon dioxide. When we compare carbon footprints,
plastic bags are the clear winner. But environmental impact 
is also determined by how the bag is used. Reusing or recycling these bags significantly offsets 
their environmental toll by reducing demand for new production. To quantify that offset, we can divide
the bag’s carbon footprint by the number of times it’s reused. For example, if a typical paper bag 
is reused three times, it has a lower net impact 
than a single-use plastic bag. The carbon footprint of a cotton tote
can similarly be lowered, if it’s reused 131 times. Of these three options, durable cloth
totes are most likely to be reused. Evidence shows paper bags are quickly
discarded due to their tendency to tear. This issue plagues HDPE
plastic bags as well. But even when they’re made 
to avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes
it easy to treat them as single-use items. Fortunately, researchers estimate
that 40% of HDPE bags are reused at least once
for throwing out waste. Recycling these bags also offsets 
their carbon footprint, but it’s not universally possible 
for each material. Many countries lack the infrastructure
to efficiently recycle plastic bags. Cotton totes are perhaps even more
difficult to breakdown and process, but since they’re often reused 
for long periods, they’re still least likely 
to end up in landfills. Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating
environmental impact comes into play: degradability. Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant
and insoluble, they stick around long after we’re done
with them. Partially broken down plastic 
can circulate in ecosystems for centuries. Cotton on the other hand degrades
substantially in a matter of months, and paper bags break down 
completely in just 90 days. So, which bag should you use? It turns out the most 
environmentally friendly bags have features of several materials
we've discussed. They’re durable and reusable, like cotton,
but made of plastic, which has a lower carbon footprint
than cotton or paper. These sturdy shopping bags consist of
polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide. Most importantly, 
they should last a lifetime— making them the best option 
for the planet, and your groceries.

**Transcript**:
You’ve filled up your cart and made 
it to the front of the grocery line when you’re confronted 
with yet another choice: what kind of bag should you use? If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags
strewn across the ocean, it might seem obvious that plastic 
is bad for the environment. Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote
would be the better option. But is that really true? Each of these three materials 
has a unique environmental impact that’s determined by its carbon footprint, its potential to be reused and recycled,
and its degradability. So, to get the full story 
on these grocery bags we need to look at how they’re made, how they’re used, 
and where they ultimately go. Let’s start with plastic. The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag 
is made of high-density polyethylene, commonly known as HDPE. Producing this material requires
extracting petroleum from the ground and applying extreme heat. The resulting polymer resin 
is then transported alongside additional ingredients 
like titanium oxide and chalk to a bag manufacturing plant. Here, coal powered machines 
melt the materials down and spin them into sheets of plastic, which are then folded into bags. By the time a bag reaches
its final destination, it’s contributed an estimated 1.6 kg
of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the same amount of carbon
a car produces, driving a little over 6 kilometers. But the alternatives actually possess
a much larger carbon footprint. Paper is made from wood pulp, and when you account for the carbon cost
of removing trees from their ecosystems, a single paper bag can be responsible
for about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely
energy and water intensive process. The production of a single cotton tote emits an estimated 272 kg
of carbon dioxide. When we compare carbon footprints,
plastic bags are the clear winner. But environmental impact 
is also determined by how the bag is used. Reusing or recycling these bags significantly offsets 
their environmental toll by reducing demand for new production. To quantify that offset, we can divide
the bag’s carbon footprint by the number of times it’s reused. For example, if a typical paper bag 
is reused three times, it has a lower net impact 
than a single-use plastic bag. The carbon footprint of a cotton tote
can similarly be lowered, if it’s reused 131 times. Of these three options, durable cloth
totes are most likely to be reused. Evidence shows paper bags are quickly
discarded due to their tendency to tear. This issue plagues HDPE
plastic bags as well. But even when they’re made 
to avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes
it easy to treat them as single-use items. Fortunately, researchers estimate
that 40% of HDPE bags are reused at least once
for throwing out waste. Recycling these bags also offsets 
their carbon footprint, but it’s not universally possible 
for each material. Many countries lack the infrastructure
to efficiently recycle plastic bags. Cotton totes are perhaps even more
difficult to breakdown and process, but since they’re often reused 
for long periods, they’re still least likely 
to end up in landfills. Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating
environmental impact comes into play: degradability. Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant
and insoluble, they stick around long after we’re done
with them. Partially broken down plastic 
can circulate in ecosystems for centuries. Cotton on the other hand degrades
substantially in a matter of months, and paper bags break down 
completely in just 90 days. So, which bag should you use? It turns out the most 
environmentally friendly bags have features of several materials
we've discussed. They’re durable and reusable, like cotton,
but made of plastic, which has a lower carbon footprint
than cotton or paper. These sturdy shopping bags consist of
polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide. Most importantly, 
they should last a lifetime— making them the best option 
for the planet, and your groceries.

**Transcript**:
In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska 
were enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city. But their laughter froze when they heard
the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door. Sendler rushed to the window to dispose
of incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina 
her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names 
of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety. This arrest wasn’t the first consequence 
Sendler had faced in her lifelong crusade
against anti-Semitism. Born to Catholic parents in 1910,
she grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish 
patients other doctors refused to help. Irena was furious at the constant
discrimination against her Jewish friends. As a graduate student in social welfare
at the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced 
the segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation
for troublemaking. Buoyed by her socialist ideals 
and inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish
families across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism
surging through Europe. But in September 1939, 
Nazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further
eroded Jewish rights. In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds
of thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just 
over one square mile of land. Bordered by high walls and subject 
to constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto
quickly became starving and sick. Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues
secured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking
for typhus outbreaks. At first, her group worked 
to smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish 
officials and the medical underground. But as desperate parents began sending
their children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that
to help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape. Sendler and her associates developed 
a coordinated campaign of rescue missions. Children were bundled into dirty laundry,
packed into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses 
in coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases. Bigger children escaped 
through the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries. Sendler helped ferry these children 
to safe houses, before forging them new documents 
and sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families
across Poland. To retain their Jewish identities
and keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records
on thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars. This work was punishable by death. But for Sendler, such consequences
paled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents
to part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion. In 1942, the Nazis began transporting 
Jews from the ghetto into concentration camps. Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi
resistance group called Zegota. Zegota helped Sendler expand her
operation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw. But this system would also be 
Sendler’s downfall. When the Gestapo threatened a laundry
owner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name. At 3am on October 20th, the 
Gestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews
throughout the country. The police had captured Sendler,
but her records remained safe. Janina protected the children’s names
with her life, all without knowing whether 
her friend would ever return. Despite enduring months of physical
and psychological torture, Sendler betrayed no information. Defiant to the end, she was sentenced
to execution on January 20th, 1944. But as she walked to her death, 
a German officer diverted her course. Zegota had paid the Gestapo 
the modern equivalent of over $100,000 for Sendler’s release. That night as she listened to bullhorns
proclaiming her death, Sendler’s work began anew. Remaining in hiding, she continued 
to oversee Zegota’s rescue missions until Germany’s defeat in 1945. After the war, Sendler reconnected
with the children she’d helped escape, remaining in contact with many
for the rest of her life. And while the new Polish government
sought to suppress her story, the children she rescued ensured 
she was recognized for her work. Yet despite all the lives she saved, Sendler remained hesitant to accept
praise for her actions, remarking, “I continue to have qualms of conscience
that I did so little.”

packed into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses 
in coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases. Bigger children escaped 
through the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries. Sendler helped ferry these children 
to safe houses, before forging them new documents 
and sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families
across Poland. To retain their Jewish identities
and keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records
on thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars. This work was punishable by death. But for Sendler, such consequences
paled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents
to part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion. In 1942, the Nazis began transporting 
Jews from the ghetto into concentration camps. Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi
resistance group called Zegota. Zegota helped Sendler expand her
operation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw. But this system would also be 
Sendler’s downfall. When the Gestapo threatened a laundry
owner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name. At 3am on October 20th, the 
Gestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews
throughout the country. The police had captured Sendler,
but her records remained safe. Janina protected the children’s names
with her life, all without knowing whether 
her friend would ever return. Despite enduring months of physical
and psychological torture, Sendler betrayed no information. Defiant to the end, she was sentenced
to execution on January 20th, 1944. But as she walked to her death, 
a German officer diverted her course. Zegota had paid the Gestapo 
the modern equivalent of over $100,000 for Sendler’s release. That night as she listened to bullhorns
proclaiming her death, Sendler’s work began anew. Remaining in hiding, she continued 
to oversee Zegota’s rescue missions until Germany’s defeat in 1945. After the war, Sendler reconnected
with the children she’d helped escape, remaining in contact with many
for the rest of her life. And while the new Polish government
sought to suppress her story, the children she rescued ensured 
she was recognized for her work. Yet despite all the lives she saved, Sendler remained hesitant to accept
praise for her actions, remarking, “I continue to have qualms of conscience
that I did so little.”

**Transcript**:
In Warsaw, late October 1943, Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska 
were enjoying a rare moment of peace in their war-torn city. But their laughter froze when they heard
the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door. Sendler rushed to the window to dispose
of incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina 
her most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names 
of over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety. This arrest wasn’t the first consequence 
Sendler had faced in her lifelong crusade
against anti-Semitism. Born to Catholic parents in 1910,
she grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish 
patients other doctors refused to help. Irena was furious at the constant
discrimination against her Jewish friends. As a graduate student in social welfare
at the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced 
the segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation
for troublemaking. Buoyed by her socialist ideals 
and inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish
families across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism
surging through Europe. But in September 1939, 
Nazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further
eroded Jewish rights. In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds
of thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just 
over one square mile of land. Bordered by high walls and subject 
to constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto
quickly became starving and sick. Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues
secured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking
for typhus outbreaks. At first, her group worked 
to smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish 
officials and the medical underground. But as desperate parents began sending
their children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that
to help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape. Sendler and her associates developed

**Transcript**:
Whether she’s describing 
bickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as 
though it was written just for you. Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness 
informs her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers
with a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers 
feel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully 
wicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of 
tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found 
in her sly satires of society, civility, 
and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode 
the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common 
thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style 
of writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, 
and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, 
friendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs 
about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules 
of their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, 
and small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, 
but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule 
senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical 
importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial 
necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between
the mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits 
of making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums 
this up in "Mansfield Park;" “I would have everybody marry 
if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people 
throw themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also 
present in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles 
found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write 
and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found
in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, 
pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide 
an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet 
of "Pride and Prejudice," whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives 
blinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot 
of "Persuasion," who chooses to remain unmarried 
after the disappearance of her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family 
at the cost of her own desires in "Sense and Sensibility." These women all encounter 
difficult choices about romantic, filial, and 
financial stability, and they resolve them without 
sacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters 
are far from perfect. They often think they have 
all the answers. And by telling the story 
from their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing 
their heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under 
the protagonist and the reader. In "Emma," the titular character feels 
surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope 
to match her wit. As her guests prattle on and 
on about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character 
in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control 
as she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing 
her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the 
inconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen 
prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable 
for modern sensibilities. So hopefully, new readers will continue 
to find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to come.

**Transcript**:
Whether she’s describing 
bickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as 
though it was written just for you. Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness 
informs her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers
with a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers 
feel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully 
wicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of 
tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found 
in her sly satires of society, civility, 
and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode 
the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common 
thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style 
of writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, 
and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, 
friendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs 
about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules 
of their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, 
and small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, 
but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule 
senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical 
importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial 
necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between
the mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits 
of making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums 
this up in "Mansfield Park;" “I would have everybody marry 
if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people 
throw themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also 
present in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles 
found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write 
and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found
in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, 
pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide

**Transcript**:
Noor Inayat Khan was in the midst of a 
desperate escape. She had been imprisoned for her activities
as an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and 
two other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind 
of events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian 
Muslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly 
peaceful home. Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of 
music and compassion. They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology 
and published children’s books. But all this changed with the advent 
of the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army 
ready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced 
with a difficult choice. As pacifists, they believed that all 
disputes should be settled non-violently. But witnessing the devastation 
across Europe, they decided that standing on the 
sidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s 
Auxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless 
operations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored 
by a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive 
was established to sabotage the Germans 
in Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio operator who knew 
Paris well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In her interview, she was warned that 
wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work 
in the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous 
transmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t 
protect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her 
pacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence 
networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed 
in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed 
with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, 
and Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors 
to let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio 
operators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies 
to the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back 
to London and arranged safe passage 
for allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the 
French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick 
thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way 
out of questioning. When the Gestapo searched 
her on the train, she gave them a casual tour 
of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted 
her hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for 
listening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping 
her set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth 
never failed her. But her charm had inspired 
lethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister 
of a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away 
from the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight 
and slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began 
to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again 
and sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured, 
deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who 
waged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom 
without ever taking a life.

in the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous 
transmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t 
protect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her 
pacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence 
networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed 
in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed 
with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, 
and Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors 
to let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio 
operators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies 
to the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back 
to London and arranged safe passage 
for allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the 
French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick 
thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way 
out of questioning. When the Gestapo searched 
her on the train, she gave them a casual tour 
of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted 
her hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for 
listening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping 
her set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth 
never failed her. But her charm had inspired 
lethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister 
of a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away 
from the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight 
and slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began 
to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again 
and sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured, 
deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who 
waged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom 
without ever taking a life.

**Transcript**:
The discovery of the structure of DNA was one of the most important scientific
achievements in the last century, in human history, in fact. The now-famous double helix is almost
synonymous with Watson and Crick, two of the scientists who won
the Nobel Prize for figuring it out. But there's another name 
you may know, too, Rosalind Franklin. You may have heard that her data supported
Watson and Crick's brilliant idea, or that she was a plain-dressing,
belligerent scientist, which is how Watson actually described her
in "The Double Helix." But thanks to Franklin's biographers, who investigated her life 
and interviewed many people close to her, we now know that that account
is far from true, and her scientific contributions
have been vastly underplayed. Let's hear the real story. Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born
in London in 1920. She wanted to be a scientist ever
since she was a teenager, which wasn't a common or easy
career path for girls at that time. But she excelled at science anyway. She won a scholarship to Cambridge
to study chemistry, where she earned her Ph.D., and she later conducted research on
the structure of coal that led to better gas masks for 
the British during World War II. In 1951, she joined King's College to use x-ray techniques to study
the structure of DNA, then one of the hottest topics in science. Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab
and got to work shining high-energy x-rays 
on tiny, wet crystals of DNA. But the acadmemic culture at the time
wasn't very friendly to women, and Franklin was isolated 
from her colleagues. She clashed with Maurice Wilkins, a labmate who assumed Franklin
had been hired as his assistant. But Franklin kept working, and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51,
the most famous x-ray image of DNA. Just getting the image took 100 hours, the calculations necessary to analyze it
would take a year. Meanwhile, the American biologist
James Watson and the British physicist Francis Crick were also working 
on finding DNA's structure. Without Franklin's knowledge, Wilkins took Photo 51
and showed it to Watson and Crick. Instead of calculating the exact
position of every atom, they did a quick analysis 
of Franklin's data and used that to build 
a few potential structures. Eventually, they arrived at the right one. DNA is made of two helicoidal strands, one opposite the other with bases
in the center like rungs of a ladder. Watson and Crick published their model
in April 1953. Meanwhile, 
Franklin had finished her calculations, come to the same conclusion, and submitted her own manuscript. The journal published 
the manuscripts together, but put Franklin's last, making it look like her experiments just
confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough instead of inspiring it. But Franklin had already 
stopped working on DNA and died of cancer in 1958, never knowing that Watson and Crick
had seen her photographs. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won
the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA. It's often said that Franklin would have
been recognized by a Nobel Prize if only they could be 
awarded posthumously. And, in fact, it's possible 
she could have won twice. Her work on the structure of viruses
led to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982. It's time to tell the story of a brave
woman who fought sexism in science, and whose work revolutionized
medicine, biology, and agriculture. It's time to honor 
Rosalind Elsie Franklin, the unsung mother of the double helix.

**Transcript**:
From 1930 to 1961, thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered under Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship 
in the Dominican Republic. Three sisters would go on to lead 
an underground revolution. But while their courage inspired many,
it threatened the man in power, and their lives would come 
to a tragic early end. Trujillo rose through the military ranks 
during the United States’ occupation of the Dominican Republic. He assumed power in 1930 through a coup
and rigged election and created a system that enriched 
himself and his allies. Trujillo’s family alone 
controlled three-fifths of the country’s gross domestic product, including monopolies 
over salt, beef, and newspapers. He renamed the country's
capital after himself and expected his portrait to be
displayed in every household. And he committed atrocities, including 
the massacre of thousands of Haitians. All the while, a secret police force
maintained his power by targeting opponents at home and abroad. The Mirabal sisters grew up in a middle
class family in the countryside. Their parents sent the four sisters— Patria, Dedé, Minerva, and María Teresa— to one of the country’s 
best boarding schools. There, Minerva met a classmate whose
relative was killed on Trujillo's orders. She began seeking out strong
voices of opposition and discussing issues of oppression
and justice with her sisters. While Dedé stayed out of politics, Minerva, Patria, and María Teresa became
invested in changing their country. However, the Mirabal family’s 
safe standing soon collapsed. In 1949, they were invited 
to one of Trujillo’s parties, which served as his personal hunting
grounds for young women. Declining the invitation
was not an option. Despite Minerva’s attempts 
to avoid him at the reception, she eventually danced with Trujillo
but rejected his advances. The Mirabal family left the party early, which was seldom done and considered
disrespectful to the dictator. Their father, Enrique, was imprisoned
and family property was confiscated. Minerva graduated with highest honors as one of the first women in the country 
to receive a law degree. But she was denied state authorization
to practice— a process Trujillo oversaw. While studying, Minerva met 
Manolo Tavárez Justo. He shared her political convictions
and the two married in 1955. They watched as armed revolutions launched
throughout Latin America. After Trujillo crushed an attempt
to overthrow him in 1959, they began to prepare a revolution
of their own. The Mirabal sisters and their husbands
formed the June 14th movement along with many others 
from the middle class. Codenamed Las Mariposas, 
or the Butterflies, the three sisters organized 
and attended clandestine meetings and distributed pamphlets detailing
Trujillo’s violations. In January of 1960, they called representatives together 
from all over the country to establish the movement’s structure 
and prepare an uprising. But it was not to be. Trujillo had spies everywhere. Soon, many revolutionaries, including
Minerva and María Teresa, were arrested. During this time, Patria found creative
ways of transmitting information to and from imprisoned rebels. Fearful of losing the support
of the U.S. and the Church, which had recently begun to criticize him, Trujillo released the sisters while
leaving their husbands imprisoned. But they continued to threaten 
his regime’s stability— and his ego. On November 25th, as the three sisters were returning from 
visiting two of their imprisoned husbands, Trujillo’s men stopped their car. The sisters, along with their driver,
Rufino de la Cruz, were asphyxiated and beaten to death. The men rolled the Jeep off a hill 
to frame the murder as a car accident. Patria was 36, Minerva was 33,
and María Teresa was 25. But Trujillo's plan to silence
the Mirabal sisters and stabilize his regime 
backfired. Much of the public wasn’t fooled
by the flimsy coverup. The international community condemned
the assassination. And the U.S. closed its Dominican embassy and secretly invested 
in the anti-Trujillo movement. Months later, former members 
of the Dominican military killed the dictator, bringing his violent,
31-year reign to an end. Thanks to their family, especially
their surviving sister, Dedé, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters would 
surpass the clutches of Trujillo’s tyranny even long after their deaths. Today, the Mirabal sisters
are national heroes with monuments and honors 
commemorating their struggle. In 1999, the United Nations
declared November 25th, the anniversary of their deaths, the International Day for the Elimination
of Violence Against Women. Their courageous fight for justice
has inspired generations.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From 1930 to 1961, thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered under Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship 
in the Dominican Republic. Three sisters would go on to lead 
an underground revolution. But while their courage inspired many,
it threatened the man in power, and their lives would come 
to a tragic early end. Trujillo rose through the military ranks 
during the United States’ occupation of the Dominican Republic. He assumed power in 1930 through a coup
and rigged election and created a system that enriched 
himself and his allies. Trujillo’s family alone 
controlled three-fifths of the country’s gross domestic product, including monopolies 
over salt, beef, and newspapers. He renamed the country's
capital after himself and expected his portrait to be
displayed in every household. And he committed atrocities, including 
the massacre of thousands of Haitians. All the while, a secret police force
maintained his power by targeting opponents at home and abroad. The Mirabal sisters grew up in a middle
class family in the countryside. Their parents sent the four sisters— Patria, Dedé, Minerva, and María Teresa— to one of the country’s 
best boarding schools. There, Minerva met a classmate whose
relative was killed on Trujillo's orders. She began seeking out strong
voices of opposition and discussing issues of oppression
and justice with her sisters. While Dedé stayed out of politics, Minerva, Patria, and María Teresa became
invested in changing their country. However, the Mirabal family’s 
safe standing soon collapsed. In 1949, they were invited 
to one of Trujillo’s parties, which served as his personal hunting
grounds for young women. Declining the invitation
was not an option. Despite Minerva’s attempts 
to avoid him at the reception, she eventually danced with Trujillo
but rejected his advances. The Mirabal family left the party early, which was seldom done and considered
disrespectful to the dictator. Their father, Enrique, was imprisoned
and family property was confiscated. Minerva graduated with highest honors as one of the first women in the country 
to receive a law degree. But she was denied state authorization
to practice— a process Trujillo oversaw. While studying, Minerva met 
Manolo Tavárez Justo. He shared her political convictions
and the two married in 1955. They watched as armed revolutions launched
throughout Latin America. After Trujillo crushed an attempt
to overthrow him in 1959, they began to prepare a revolution
of their own. The Mirabal sisters and their husbands
formed the June 14th movement along with many others 
from the middle class. Codenamed Las Mariposas, 
or the Butterflies, the three sisters organized 
and attended clandestine meetings and distributed pamphlets detailing
Trujillo’s violations. In January of 1960, they called representatives together 
from all over the country to establish the movement’s structure 
and prepare an uprising. But it was not to be. Trujillo had spies everywhere. Soon, many revolutionaries, including
Minerva and María Teresa, were arrested. During this time, Patria found creative
ways of transmitting information to and from imprisoned rebels. Fearful of losing the support
of the U.S. and the Church, which had recently begun to criticize him, Trujillo released the sisters while
leaving their husbands imprisoned. But they continued to threaten 
his regime’s stability— and his ego. On November 25th, as the three sisters were returning from 
visiting two of their imprisoned husbands, Trujillo’s men stopped their car. The sisters, along with their driver,
Rufino de la Cruz, were asphyxiated and beaten to death. The men rolled the Jeep off a hill 
to frame the murder as a car accident. Patria was 36, Minerva was 33,
and María Teresa was 25. But Trujillo's plan to silence
the Mirabal sisters and stabilize his regime 
backfired. Much of the public wasn’t fooled
by the flimsy coverup. The international community condemned
the assassination. And the U.S. closed its Dominican embassy and secretly invested 
in the anti-Trujillo movement. Months later, former members 
of the Dominican military killed the dictator, bringing his violent,
31-year reign to an end. Thanks to their family, especially
their surviving sister, Dedé, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters would 
surpass the clutches of Trujillo’s tyranny even long after their deaths. Today, the Mirabal sisters
are national heroes with monuments and honors 
commemorating their struggle. In 1999, the United Nations
declared November 25th, the anniversary of their deaths, the International Day for the Elimination
of Violence Against Women. Their courageous fight for justice
has inspired generations.
