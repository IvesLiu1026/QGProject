[Music] good morning I would like to discuss with you your place in space now I'm not going to talk about black holes are gonna be no multiverses there will not even be plunk time I'm talking about fundamental astronomy that lets us know where we are in the cosmos our story begins on earth many people you know are from Earth including my father now my father was in law school in 1940 I don't want to shock anybody over here but he didn't really like it so he got a summer job working for the US Navy on earth on Wake Island now Wake Island is in the middle of Pacific Ocean nowhere so my dad was working for a contractor building an airstrip which is still there on Wake Island and they had a great time says it's the greatest summer job he ever had but then in the late fall of 1941 December 7th Wake Island was bombed same day as Pearl Harbor many other Pacific Ocean targets my father and his comrades fought back for two weeks and they shot down at least two Japanese bombers every day for two weeks but they the Japanese Navy eventually showed up with foe Atilla many ships and they captured everybody on Christmas Eve my dad wrote in his diary saddest day of my life well they were taken to China someplace and my dad was in prison camp for almost four years 44 months longer than anyone else from the United States and he had very dark skies at night they had no electricity and the Japanese military confiscated all their jewelry and watches and so on so they had no way to tell time so the family myth is my dad would tell time by sticking a shovel handle in the dirt and watching the shadow he watched the shadows of sticks and Pera they would tell the guard what it was and when it was time to eat lunch and he was also the family myth able to infer when you know the time of year they're able to figure out their latitude so this guy who my dad said wasn't even this tall was able to crawl through a vent in this train car and get back to the east coast of China and make it all the way to the United States and tell everybody what happened because these guys essentially disappeared I mean I don't know why they didn't tweet where they were just or use Facebook but eventually the deal is my dad lived through it and he got back to the states he married his college sweetheart Here I am along with my older brother and sister and through all this my father became fascinated with sundials so yes he created the well known sand dial which you take to the beach so you don't have to get sand in your watch Oh everybody needs one believe me and then he wrote articles for the Washington DC area newspapers and he eventually wrote a book about sundials and that's when he was given a lifetime membership in the North American sundial Society anybody now ecology does tell you there's a lot of CFO's here chief financial officers a lot of operating there's a lot of accountants and you know how the accountants can party it's crazy yeah well let me tell you it when you're with the sundial people it is nuts man I mean everybody's it's movie look it's moving so so I of course was a rebellious teenager and so on but I did notice that last summer I brought out one of the old sand aisles and seemed to still work just fine and someone I know converted a conventional pizza box into a polar sundial now this might be evidence of a Saudi sundial obsessive disorder but I'm fine now I'm fine I could quit if I wanted I just don't want to that's all so I got invited to a meeting many years ago at Cornell University and they had this thing this is the test pattern for the cameras that were going to Mars this is the photometric calibration target and I think you can see their color coupons that you get the colors right and there are three gray rings of different values and so they were casting a shadow with this little metal post so you could look at the color of the Martian sky now if you look at the at a shadow on earth that's something very white you'll see it's blue just a little bit from the Earth's sky so I'm in this meeting and I go you guys we gotta turn the photometric calibration target into a sundial and they're looking at me no you guys it'll be cool we can reckon time on another world it'll be like speaking Klingon except it'll be real and so the head guy Steve Squire said okay so my friends there are two sundials on Mars while we're here so here's what I want you to do when you go to Mars next time and you're standing there you got to take some food and water it's 687 Earth days you will see the Sun make this pattern through the sky as the year goes on if you do it on earth you will see this pattern that's I started on the 2nd of March it'll go north and this pattern is called the analemma the analemma zone Latin word that means the pedestal of niall so what I want you guys to do is to build one of these and so what we have done if you go to our website Planetary org and we'll find the instructions for laying out the lines and getting the hours right for your sundial anywhere in the world you can furnish it anything that's not on the dial to tell time is its furniture you can furnish it with here some sailboats and anchors and here's the traditional latitude and longitude and it's the ping-pong ball is the gnomon because ping-pong balls are available anywhere in the world so we did this back in 2004 when the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars and people all over the world built these but those days webcams were kind of a hassle this year we're hoping it will be really cool so here's what I'm telling you almost everybody has observed the Sun go up and down as the year goes on in the sky very few of us have heard the word analemma yet we all depend on it you go to office supply stores you get your calendars with the kittens and the puppies and the firefighters with no shirts on and all of that has figured out we had a leap day this year all of that is figured out by knowing intimately our relationship to the Sun knowing intimately our place in space so I submit to you my friends if you take the time you can dare I say it change the world thank you all very much thank you [Applause]

but I'm fine now I'm fine I could quit if I wanted I just don't want to that's all so I got invited to a meeting many years ago at Cornell University and they had this thing this is the test pattern for the cameras that were going to Mars this is the photometric calibration target and I think you can see their color coupons that you get the colors right and there are three gray rings of different values and so they were casting a shadow with this little metal post so you could look at the color of the Martian sky now if you look at the at a shadow on earth that's something very white you'll see it's blue just a little bit from the Earth's sky so I'm in this meeting and I go you guys we gotta turn the photometric calibration target into a sundial and they're looking at me no you guys it'll be cool we can reckon time on another world it'll be like speaking Klingon except it'll be real and so the head guy Steve Squire said okay so my friends there are two sundials on Mars while we're here so here's what I want you to do when you go to Mars next time and you're standing there you got to take some food and water it's 687 Earth days you will see the Sun make this pattern through the sky as the year goes on if you do it on earth you will see this pattern that's I started on the 2nd of March it'll go north and this pattern is called the analemma the analemma zone Latin word that means the pedestal of niall so what I want you guys to do is to build one of these and so what we have done if you go to our website Planetary org and we'll find the instructions for laying out the lines and getting the hours right for your sundial anywhere in the world you can furnish it anything that's not on the dial to tell time is its furniture you can furnish it with here some sailboats and anchors and here's the traditional latitude and longitude and it's the ping-pong ball is the gnomon because ping-pong balls are available anywhere in the world so we did this back in 2004 when the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars and people all over the world built these but those days webcams were kind of a hassle this year we're hoping it will be really cool so here's what I'm telling you almost everybody has observed the Sun go up and down as the year goes on in the sky very few of us have heard the word analemma yet we all depend on it you go to office supply stores you get your calendars with the kittens and the puppies and the firefighters with no shirts on and all of that has figured out we had a leap day this year all of that is figured out by knowing intimately our relationship to the Sun knowing intimately our place in space so I submit to you my friends if you take the time you can dare I say it change the world thank you all very much thank you [Applause]

[Music] good morning I would like to discuss with you your place in space now I'm not going to talk about black holes are gonna be no multiverses there will not even be plunk time I'm talking about fundamental astronomy that lets us know where we are in the cosmos our story begins on earth many people you know are from Earth including my father now my father was in law school in 1940 I don't want to shock anybody over here but he didn't really like it so he got a summer job working for the US Navy on earth on Wake Island now Wake Island is in the middle of Pacific Ocean nowhere so my dad was working for a contractor building an airstrip which is still there on Wake Island and they had a great time says it's the greatest summer job he ever had but then in the late fall of 1941 December 7th Wake Island was bombed same day as Pearl Harbor many other Pacific Ocean targets my father and his comrades fought back for two weeks and they shot down at least two Japanese bombers every day for two weeks but they the Japanese Navy eventually showed up with foe Atilla many ships and they captured everybody on Christmas Eve my dad wrote in his diary saddest day of my life well they were taken to China someplace and my dad was in prison camp for almost four years 44 months longer than anyone else from the United States and he had very dark skies at night they had no electricity and the Japanese military confiscated all their jewelry and watches and so on so they had no way to tell time so the family myth is my dad would tell time by sticking a shovel handle in the dirt and watching the shadow he watched the shadows of sticks and Pera they would tell the guard what it was and when it was time to eat lunch and he was also the family myth able to infer when you know the time of year they're able to figure out their latitude so this guy who my dad said wasn't even this tall was able to crawl through a vent in this train car and get back to the east coast of China and make it all the way to the United States and tell everybody what happened because these guys essentially disappeared I mean I don't know why they didn't tweet where they were just or use Facebook but eventually the deal is my dad lived through it and he got back to the states he married his college sweetheart Here I am along with my older brother and sister and through all this my father became fascinated with sundials so yes he created the well known sand dial which you take to the beach so you don't have to get sand in your watch Oh everybody needs one believe me and then he wrote articles for the Washington DC area newspapers and he eventually wrote a book about sundials and that's when he was given a lifetime membership in the North American sundial Society anybody now ecology does tell you there's a lot of CFO's here chief financial officers a lot of operating there's a lot of accountants and you know how the accountants can party it's crazy yeah well let me tell you it when you're with the sundial people it is nuts man I mean everybody's it's movie look it's moving so so I of course was a rebellious teenager and so on but I did notice that last summer I brought out one

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain that we'll label our subconscious. The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens
thousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information
and details from our experience. We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects
that we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions. This is also where
our emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away? Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served. And now this guy
has just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. "That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience. "That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot." And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby, called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor and needs to get
to the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely, and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual. "My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk." But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique
human function of free will. Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations
did you filter in as a result of your beliefs, and why? Are your assumptions valid
and supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings, and result in new and better
conclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks who first proposed the Ladder of Inference, while Question 1 asks what the Ladder of Inference is and who proposed it. Both questions are related to the origin of the Ladder of Inference, and both mention the proposer, Chris Argyris.

However, it's worth noting that Question 1 is not a perfect match, as it combines two questions into one and does not provide a direct match for the options in the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, it is the closest match among the generated MCQs.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain that we'll label our subconscious. The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens
thousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information
and details from our experience. We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects
that we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions. This is also where
our emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away? Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served. And now this guy
has just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. "That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience. "That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot." And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby, called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor and needs to get
to the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely, and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual. "My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk." But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique
human function of free will. Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations
did you filter in as a result of your beliefs, and why? Are your assumptions valid
and supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings, and result in new and better
conclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content is similar. Question 4 asks, "What happens on the second rung of the Ladder of Inference?" and one of the options (A) states, "We filter in specific information and details from our experience." This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks, "On the second rung of the Ladder of Inference, we filter in specific information and details because:" 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on recalling specific steps or events in the Ladder of Inference model, whereas the ground truth MCQ requires a deeper understanding of why specific information is filtered in on the second rung. 

Therefore, while Question 4 is the most similar, it's not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be needed to accurately assess the same knowledge and understanding as the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As you can imagine, 400 years ago, navigating the open ocean was difficult. The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course, and so sailors based their directions on the port they left, attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed. This process was known as dead reckoning, because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon. This was an easy mistake to make. Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible: sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily. All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land. John Bird, an instrument maker in London, made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day, called a sextant. Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time. Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship. Clocks came next. In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter, built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea. The timepiece that could maintain accurate time while on a pitching, yawing deck in harsh conditions was necessary in order to know the time back in England. There was one catch though: since such a timepiece was handmade, it was very expensive. So an alternate method using lunar measurements and intense calculations was often used to cut costs. The calculations to determine a ship's location for each measurement could take hours. But sextants and clocks weren't useful unless sailors could use these tools to determine their position. Fortunately, in the 1600s, an amateur mathematician had invented the missing piece. John Napier toiled for more than 20 years in his castle in Scotland to develop logarithms, a calculation device. Napier's ideas on logarithms involved the form of one over E and the constant 10 to the seventh power. Algebra in the early 1600s was not fully developed, and Napier's logarithm of one did not equal zero. This made the calculations much less convenient than logarithms with a base of 10. Henry Briggs, a famous mathematician at Gresham College in London, read Napier's work in 1614, and the following year made the long journey to Edinburgh to meet Napier. Briggs showed up unannounced at Napier's castle door and suggested that John switch the base and form of his logarithms into something much simpler. They both agreed that a base of 10 with the log of one equal to zero would greatly simplify everyday calculations. Today we remember these as Briggs Common Logarithms. Until the development of electric calculating machines in the 20th century, any calculations involving multiplication, division, powers, and extraction of roots with large and small numbers were done using logarithms. The history of logarithms isn't just a lesson in math. There were many players responsible for successful navigation. Instrument makers, astronomers, mathematicians, and of course sailors. Creativity isn't only about going deep into one's field of work, it's about cross-pollination between disciplines too.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As you can imagine, 400 years ago, navigating the open ocean was difficult. The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course, and so sailors based their directions on the port they left, attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed. This process was known as dead reckoning, because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon. This was an easy mistake to make. Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible: sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily. All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land. John Bird, an instrument maker in London, made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day, called a sextant. Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time. Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship. Clocks came next. In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter, built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As you can imagine, 400 years ago, navigating the open ocean was difficult. The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course, and so sailors based their directions on the port they left, attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed. This process was known as dead reckoning, because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon. This was an easy mistake to make. Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible: sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily. All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land. John Bird, an instrument maker in London, made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day, called a sextant. Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time. Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship. Clocks came next. In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter, built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea. The timepiece that could maintain accurate time while on a pitching, yawing deck in harsh conditions was necessary in order to know the time back in England. There was one catch though: since such a timepiece was handmade, it was very expensive. So an alternate method using lunar measurements and intense calculations was often used to cut costs. The calculations to determine a ship's location for each measurement could take hours. But sextants and clocks weren't useful unless sailors could use these tools to determine their position. Fortunately, in the 1600s, an amateur mathematician had invented the missing piece. John Napier toiled for more than 20 years in his castle in Scotland to develop logarithms, a calculation device. Napier's ideas on logarithms involved the form of one over E and the constant 10 to the seventh power. Algebra in the early 1600s was not fully developed, and Napier's logarithm of one did not equal zero. This made the calculations much less convenient than logarithms with a base of 10. Henry Briggs, a famous mathematician at Gresham College in London, read Napier's work in 1614, and the following year made the long journey to Edinburgh to meet Napier. Briggs showed up unannounced at Napier's castle door and suggested that John switch the base and form of his logarithms into something much simpler. They both agreed that a base of 10 with the log of one equal to zero would greatly simplify everyday calculations. Today we remember these as Briggs Common Logarithms. Until the development of electric calculating machines in the 20th century, any calculations involving multiplication, division, powers, and extraction of roots with large and small numbers were done using logarithms. The history of logarithms isn't just a lesson in math. There were many players responsible for successful navigation. Instrument makers, astronomers, mathematicians, and of course sailors. Creativity isn't only about going deep into one's field of work, it's about cross-pollination between disciplines too.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every minute of every day, you breathe without even thinking about it. Your body does it on its own, from the day you're born until the day you die. You have muscles contract to bring oxygen, a gas, into your lungs, which is then transferred by your bloodstream to every cell in your body. Gases are strange. We can't see them, but we know they're there because we can feel them. What we experience as wind is really trillions and trillions of gas molecules slamming into your body. And it feels good, right? Science is based on observation. Unfortunately, we cannot observe gases with our eyes -- they're too small. We have to use our other senses to make observations and draw conclusions. Observations are then compiled, and we create a model. No, not that kind of model. A model is a way scientists describe the properties of physical phenomena. First, gases always move in a straight line. We don't really have anything to demonstrate this with because gravity always pulls objects down. So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line. That would be like a gas molecule. Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own. As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes. But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter. Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity. Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do -- remember, these are assumptions -- their energy remains constant. An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top. Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy, and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball and it flies away when that energy is transferred. The total energy stays the same. Gases work the same way. If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down. The total energy is constant. Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don't like to touch. But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide. Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy the gases have. The crazy thing is that at the same temperature, all gases have the same energy. It doesn't depend on the type of gas, just the temperature that gas is at. Keep in mind this is a model for the way gas particles behave, and based on our observations, gases always move in straight lines. They're so small, that they're not measurable on their own, and they don't interact with one another. But if they do bump into one another, that energy is transferred from one particle to another, and the total amount never changes. Temperature has a major effect, and in fact, all gases at the same temperature have the same average energy. Whew! I need to go catch my breath.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every minute of every day, you breathe without even thinking about it. Your body does it on its own, from the day you're born until the day you die. You have muscles contract to bring oxygen, a gas, into your lungs, which is then transferred by your bloodstream to every cell in your body. Gases are strange. We can't see them, but we know they're there because we can feel them. What we experience as wind is really trillions and trillions of gas molecules slamming into your body. And it feels good, right? Science is based on observation. Unfortunately, we cannot observe gases with our eyes -- they're too small. We have to use our other senses to make observations and draw conclusions. Observations are then compiled, and we create a model. No, not that kind of model. A model is a way scientists describe the properties of physical phenomena. First, gases always move in a straight line. We don't really have anything to demonstrate this with because gravity always pulls objects down. So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line. That would be like a gas molecule. Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own. As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes. But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter. Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity. Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do -- remember, these are assumptions -- their energy remains constant. An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top. Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy, and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball and it flies away when that energy is transferred. The total energy stays the same. Gases work the same way. If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down. The total energy is constant. Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don't like to touch. But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide. Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy the gases have. The crazy thing is that at the same temperature, all gases have the same energy. It doesn't depend on the type of gas, just the temperature that gas is at. Keep in mind this is a model for the way gas particles behave, and based on our observations, gases always move in straight lines. They're so small, that they're not measurable on their own, and they don't interact with one another. But if they do bump into one another, that energy is transferred from one particle to another, and the total amount never changes. Temperature has a major effect, and in fact, all gases at the same temperature have the same average energy. Whew! I need to go catch my breath.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In society, we have to follow laws that maintain order. Did you know all chemical matter follows certain laws as well? In fact, we can describe those laws by looking at relationships. Some easy laws to begin with are the ones that govern the gases. Back in 1662, Robert Boyle realized that gases had an interesting response when he put them into containers and changed their volume. Take an empty bottle and put the cap on it, closing that container. Now squeeze your bottle, and what happens? The pressure inside the bottle increases when the size of the container decreases. You can only crush that container so much until the gases inside push back on your hand. This is called an inverse proportion, and it changes at the same rate for every gas. Boyle's law allows chemists to predict the volume of any gas at any given pressure because the relationship is always the same. In 1780, Jacques Charles noticed a different relationship between gases and their temperature. If you've ever seen a hot-air balloon, you've seen this law in action. When the ballons are laid out, they're totally flat. Instead of blowing the balloon up like a party balloon, they use a giant flame to heat the air inside that envelope. As the air is heated up, the balloon begins to inflate as the gas volume increases. The hotter the gas becomes, the larger the volume, and that's Charles' law. Notice this law is different from Boyle's. Charles' law is a direct relationship. As the temperature increases, the volume increases as well. The third law is also easily demonstrated. When you're blowing up party balloons, the volume increases. As you are blowing, you're forcing more and more gas particles into the balloon from your lungs. This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action. As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased, the volume will increase as well. If you add too many particles, well, you know what happens next. Laws are everywhere, even in the tiniest particles of gas. If you squeeze them, the pressure will increase as the particles are pushed together. Low volume means a high pressure because those particles push back. As the temperature increases, gases move away from one another, and the volume increases as well. Finally, if you add gas to a closed container, that container's volume will expand. But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In society, we have to follow laws that maintain order. Did you know all chemical matter follows certain laws as well? In fact, we can describe those laws by looking at relationships. Some easy laws to begin with are the ones that govern the gases. Back in 1662, Robert Boyle realized that gases had an interesting response when he put them into containers and changed their volume. Take an empty bottle and put the cap on it, closing that container. Now squeeze your bottle, and what happens? The pressure inside the bottle increases when the size of the container decreases. You can only crush that container so much until the gases inside push back on your hand. This is called an inverse proportion, and it changes at the same rate for every gas. Boyle's law allows chemists to predict the volume of any gas at any given pressure because the relationship is always the same. In 1780, Jacques Charles noticed a different relationship between gases and their temperature. If you've ever seen a hot-air balloon, you've seen this law in action. When the ballons are laid out, they're totally flat. Instead of blowing the balloon up like a party balloon, they use a giant flame to heat the air inside that envelope. As the air is heated up, the balloon begins to inflate as the gas volume increases. The hotter the gas becomes, the larger the volume, and that's Charles' law. Notice this law is different from Boyle's. Charles' law is a direct relationship. As the temperature increases, the volume increases as well. The third law is also easily demonstrated. When you're blowing up party balloons, the volume increases. As you are blowing, you're forcing more and more gas particles into the balloon from your lungs. This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action. As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased, the volume will increase as well. If you add too many particles, well, you know what happens next. Laws are everywhere, even in the tiniest particles of gas. If you squeeze them, the pressure will increase as the particles are pushed together. Low volume means a high pressure because those particles push back. As the temperature increases, gases move away from one another, and the volume increases as well. Finally, if you add gas to a closed container, that container's volume will expand. But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Optics, or the enhancement of our natural vision, has been one of the biggest catalysts for science over the past 500 years, Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest, but more practical matters that led to the initial advancements in optics, starting around 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press. In short order, books, which had been a rarity, were now becoming a widespread phenomenon. All that new reading material meant more knowledge was circulating, but it also meant that more people were straining their eyes, likely as they read by candlelight. And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286, the need for reading glasses increased substantially. Now that people could use lenses to see things more clearly, they started wondering if vision could be enhanced to see things the human eye couldn't perceive by its own devices. Robert Hooke pursued microscopy, and 1665 he published his findings of worlds inside worlds, which he called "cells" in the book "Micrographia." At the other end of the spectrum, Galileo innovated with telescopic lenses, and in 1609, he had refined a telescope until he had an instrument powerful enough to see distant objects in the sky with an accuracy no one had before him. He found that the moon had craters and mountains, that Jupiter had moons of its own, and the whole system governing the earth and space was brought into question. Not everyone was thrilled with all the things Galileo saw though. For instance, it was taught at the time that the moon was a perfectly smooth sphere. Yet here was visual proof that was awfully hard to discount. Upon finding moons around Jupiter, he also verified what Johannes Kepler had surmised: that the earth was not the center of the universe, dispelling another central dogma of Galileo's day. Then almost exactly a year after Galileo died, Isaac Newton was born. A lot that had been unknown was visible by now, but much of it was simply the foundation for further questions. What was light anyway? And color, for that matter? What were the laws that governed the earth, and the heavens? And could we capture them through keen observation? Newton experimented extensively with optics, and came to understand light as something of substance, and colors as components of light at different frequencies. Before Newton, people widely believed that the color was due to different amounts of light, with red being lots of light, and blue being mostly dark. Newton's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism, but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again, thus showing that color was a matter of light's refraction rather than how light or dark it was. Newton's studies of optics led to the development of the reflecting telescope. This, together with his study of planetary motion, led to his theory of gravitation, one of the world's greatest examples of learning to see something invisible by observing its effect on things that are visible. So fast forward a few hundred years, and here we stand. We've evolved from a single lens to optics that reveal the birth of a star in another galaxy, or a child developing in the womb, or an electron whirling around an atom. At a time when so much is visible, how we see the world around us matters even more than what we see. Will we see a world where everything important has already been discovered? Or will we see one in which yesterday's discoveries are but a doorway to the breakthroughs of tomorrow?

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, Question 4 is the closest match, as it mentions Galileo Galilei and his telescope, which is also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the year Galileo innovated telescopic lenses, the best match is not very similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say Question 4 is the closest match, but with a very low similarity score.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Optics, or the enhancement of our natural vision, has been one of the biggest catalysts for science over the past 500 years, Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest, but more practical matters that led to the initial advancements in optics, starting around 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press. In short order, books, which had been a rarity, were now becoming a widespread phenomenon. All that new reading material meant more knowledge was circulating, but it also meant that more people were straining their eyes, likely as they read by candlelight. And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286, the need for reading glasses increased substantially. Now that people could use lenses to see things more clearly, they started wondering if vision could be enhanced to see things the human eye couldn't perceive by its own devices. Robert Hooke pursued microscopy, and 1665 he published his findings of worlds inside worlds, which he called "cells" in the book "Micrographia." At the other end of the spectrum, Galileo innovated with telescopic lenses, and in 1609, he had refined a telescope until he had an instrument powerful enough to see distant objects in the sky with an accuracy no one had before him. He found that the moon had craters and mountains, that Jupiter had moons of its own, and the whole system governing the earth and space was brought into question. Not everyone was thrilled with all the things Galileo saw though. For instance, it was taught at the time that the moon was a perfectly smooth sphere. Yet here was visual proof that was awfully hard to discount. Upon finding moons around Jupiter, he also verified what Johannes Kepler had surmised: that the earth was not the center of the universe, dispelling another central dogma of Galileo's day. Then almost exactly a year after Galileo died, Isaac Newton was born. A lot that had been unknown was visible by now, but much of it was simply the foundation for further questions. What was light anyway? And color, for that matter? What were the laws that governed the earth, and the heavens? And could we capture them through keen observation? Newton experimented extensively with optics, and came to understand light as something of substance, and colors as components of light at different frequencies. Before Newton, people widely believed that the color was due to different amounts of light, with red being lots of light, and blue being mostly dark. Newton's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism, but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again, thus showing that color was a matter of light's refraction rather than how light or dark it was. Newton's studies of optics led to the development of the reflecting telescope. This, together with his study of planetary motion, led to his theory of gravitation, one of the world's greatest examples of learning to see something invisible by observing its effect on things that are visible. So fast forward a few hundred years, and here we stand. We've evolved from a single lens to optics that reveal the birth of a star in another galaxy, or a child developing in the womb, or an electron whirling around an atom. At a time when so much is visible, how we see the world around us matters even more than what we see. Will we see a world where everything important has already been discovered? Or will we see one in which yesterday's discoveries are but a doorway to the breakthroughs of tomorrow?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We take a breath every few seconds. Our life depends upon inhaling oxygen, but we never think about how we breathe. It just seems to happen automatically. How can something that seems so simple be the key to keeping us alive? Breathing starts with the environment around us. The air we breathe in, or inspire, has a mixture of gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, which is the most important for our survival. It enters our body through the nose and mouth, moves down into the pharynx, trachea and bronchial tubes, and ultimately reaches the alveoli air sacs in the lungs. The alveoli use pressure to move oxygen and nutrients into the blood. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are a pumping system that facilitates this air exchange. How you breathe affects your energy level, especially when you are under physical or emotional stress. Think back to the last difficult test you had to take. It's likely that as you became more nervous, the tension in your body increased, and your breathing quickly sped up. The shallower our breath, the less oxygen that reaches our brain, and the harder it is to focus. What's our response to physical stress, like a fast-paced game of field hockey after school? As we exert pressure on our bodies, the muscles require a great deal of energy and demand additional oxygen. Our panting breath starts to kick in, which creates pressure to draw in more air and oxygen to the body, and regulates body temperature by allowing it to cool down naturally. These aren't the only times our breathing is affected or altered. Think about the last time you got angry or emotional. Anger creates a metabolic reaction in the body, which stresses it out and heats up our internal temperature. Have you ever seen anyone lose their cool? Ultimately, if we're breathing under stress over long periods of time, there are consequences. When the cells of a body aren't getting the oxygen they need, the nutrients available to the body decrease and toxins build up in the blood. It is thought that a hypoxic, or oxygen-poor environment, can increase cancerous cells. The good news is that we can control our breath much more than we realize. This means we can increase both the quality and quantity of the breath. The science of breathing has been around for thousands of years, from ancient yogis in India to respiratory therapists working with patients today. Both would tell you that there are specific techniques that will help you improve your breathing. Breathing is all about moving air from a higher-pressure to a lower-pressure environment. More breath means more oxygen, and ultimately a greater amount of nutrients that's available for our cells and blood. We naturally do this when we let out a big sigh. Changing the air pressure going into the lungs is one of the main ways to alter breathing. Our body automatically does this when we cough, sneeze, or have the hiccups. Here's a simple experiment. Close off your right nostril with your right thumb. Breathe in and out just through the left nostril. Notice how much harder it is to get the breath in. You have to focus your attention, and use your diaphragm and muscles much more than normal. By decreasing the surface area of the airways, you're increasing the pressure of oxygen moving from the alveoli to the blood. Yogis often practice alternate nostril breathing to slow down the breath, increase oxygen, and activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which deals with the body's operations when it's at rest. Let's try another exercise. Visualize the way a dog pants when it breathes. Now try doing the same type of panting, first with your tongue out, then with your mouth closed. You will find yourself using your stomach muscles to push the air out as you exhale. Place your hand under your nose, and you'll feel the strength of the breath coming out. Breathing this way is hard because it requires an active movement of our diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Our body temperature changes quickly during this exercise from the amount of pressure we are exerting on our breath. It's no surprise that you'll find dogs doing this breath often to cool down on a hot day. When we sleep at night, the medulla center of the brain makes sure that we keep breathing. Lucky for us we don't have to think about it. During the day, our breath is much more vulnerable, especially under stressful or difficult situations. That's why it's helpful to pay attention to your breathing. If you can monitor and change your breath, you can improve both the quality and quantity of oxygen that enters your body. This lowers stress, increases energy, and strengthens your immune system. So the next time someone tells you to relax and take a deep breath, you'll know exactly why.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although Question 9 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, its options and content are more closely related to the intent of the ground truth MCQ than the other generated MCQs. The ground truth MCQ asks how the alveoli move oxygen and nutrients into the bloodstream, and the correct answer is "Pressure." Question 9 asks about the primary function of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles in breathing, which is related to facilitating air exchange and moving oxygen and nutrients into the blood. While it does not directly mention the alveoli, it does mention the role of pressure in breathing, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks how the alveoli move oxygen and nutrients into the bloodstream, with "Pressure" as one of the options. Since this is not available among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We take a breath every few seconds. Our life depends upon inhaling oxygen, but we never think about how we breathe. It just seems to happen automatically. How can something that seems so simple be the key to keeping us alive? Breathing starts with the environment around us. The air we breathe in, or inspire, has a mixture of gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, which is the most important for our survival. It enters our body through the nose and mouth, moves down into the pharynx, trachea and bronchial tubes, and ultimately reaches the alveoli air sacs in the lungs. The alveoli use pressure to move oxygen and nutrients into the blood. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are a pumping system that facilitates this air exchange. How you breathe affects your energy level, especially when you are under physical or emotional stress. Think back to the last difficult test you had to take. It's likely that as you became more nervous, the tension in your body increased, and your breathing quickly sped up. The shallower our breath, the less oxygen that reaches our brain, and the harder it is to focus. What's our response to physical stress, like a fast-paced game of field hockey after school? As we exert pressure on our bodies, the muscles require a great deal of energy and demand additional oxygen. Our panting breath starts to kick in, which creates pressure to draw in more air and oxygen to the body, and regulates body temperature by allowing it to cool down naturally. These aren't the only times our breathing is affected or altered. Think about the last time you got angry or emotional. Anger creates a metabolic reaction in the body, which stresses it out and heats up our internal temperature. Have you ever seen anyone lose their cool? Ultimately, if we're breathing under stress over long periods of time, there are consequences. When the cells of a body aren't getting the oxygen they need, the nutrients available to the body decrease and toxins build up in the blood. It is thought that a hypoxic, or oxygen-poor environment, can increase cancerous cells. The good news is that we can control our breath much more than we realize. This means we can increase both the quality and quantity of the breath. The science of breathing has been around for thousands of years, from ancient yogis in India to respiratory therapists working with patients today. Both would tell you that there are specific techniques that will help you improve your breathing. Breathing is all about moving air from a higher-pressure to a lower-pressure environment. More breath means more oxygen, and ultimately a greater amount of nutrients that's available for our cells and blood. We naturally do this when we let out a big sigh. Changing the air pressure going into the lungs is one of the main ways to alter breathing. Our body automatically does this when we cough, sneeze, or have the hiccups. Here's a simple experiment. Close off your right nostril with your right thumb. Breathe in and out just through the left nostril. Notice how much harder it is to get the breath in. You have to focus your attention, and use your diaphragm and muscles much more than normal. By decreasing the surface area of the airways, you're increasing the pressure of oxygen moving from the alveoli to the blood. Yogis often practice alternate nostril breathing to slow down the breath, increase oxygen, and activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which deals with the body's operations when it's at rest. Let's try another exercise. Visualize the way a dog pants when it breathes. Now try doing the same type of panting, first with your tongue out, then with your mouth closed. You will find yourself using your stomach muscles to push the air out as you exhale. Place your hand under your nose, and you'll feel the strength of the breath coming out. Breathing this way is hard because it requires an active movement of our diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Our body temperature changes quickly during this exercise from the amount of pressure we are exerting on our breath. It's no surprise that you'll find dogs doing this breath often to cool down on a hot day. When we sleep at night, the medulla center of the brain makes sure that we keep breathing. Lucky for us we don't have to think about it. During the day, our breath is much more vulnerable, especially under stressful or difficult situations. That's why it's helpful to pay attention to your breathing. If you can monitor and change your breath, you can improve both the quality and quantity of oxygen that enters your body. This lowers stress, increases energy, and strengthens your immune system. So the next time someone tells you to relax and take a deep breath, you'll know exactly why.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Geckos and grasshoppers, worms and watermelons, elephants and Escherichia Coli, man and mushroom. All so different in form and function, but amazingly the same in how their form and function are determined. First, all these organisms are made of one or more cells, and every cell of every living thing on earth contains all the information it takes to create and duplicate and make variations of itself. That information is stored in a very long but quite simple double molecule called DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic Acid. And the DNA of every living organism is made of chains of four smaller molecules called nucleotides. What dictates the difference between a man and a mushroom is the sequence of these nucleotides in the long DNA chain. The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases, are made of a few carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus atoms, and the molecules look like this. And each of these four bases is attached to an identical backbone molecule, a sugar called deoxyribose - the "D" in DNA - and a phosphate group. Let's simplify these nucleotides and show them like this. So, a single sequence of nucleotides joined by their common sugars would look like this. And the DNA molecule where such sequences are stored looks like this. But how does a simple molecule dictate the form and function of millions of different living things? You can think of DNA as a great library of information, information that is used to do one thing and one thing only: direct the building of different protein molecules. And it's the proteins that build the cells and keep them functioning and changing and reproducing. Here's where the familiar word 'gene' comes in. If your DNA is a library of information, a gene is a book in that library. A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule. Let's say your body needs a particular protein, like insulin. To get it, some of your cells send a protein signal through the bloodstream to the cells in your pancreas, where insulin is made. That signal protein tells other proteins in the cell's nuclei to open up a part of the DNA double helix, the insulin gene, and start making insulin proteins. As soon as enough insulin has been produced, another signal protein comes to the pancreas' cells that tells them to stop making insulin. It's like looking up a book in the DNA library about insulin, and then putting it back when you're done. There are genes in DNA for visible and invisible things that make up your body, like genes for eye color, protein pigments, for skin color, for hair color, for stopping and starting bone growth, for your blood type, for how many fingers or arms and legs you have, for proteins that influence how long you live. Your DNA probably contains between 25 thousand and 40 thousand genes, while the DNA of a worm or a plant or a fruit fly contains about 12 thousand to 20 thousand genes. Some of those genes have quite different sequences of nucleotides than yours, and some are similar to yours. Though it happens infrequently, our own nucleotide sequences can change as the result of spontaneous or environmental damage which might remove or shift a nucleotide position. This changes the gene involved, and can then change the protein. Most of these changes, called mutations, have very little effect on the organism or its descendants. some are mildly damaging, and a few can make the organism better-suited to its environment. It is these tiny changes in DNA gene sequences, happening over millions of years, that create the differences among living organisms, from geckos to grasshoppers. worms to watermelons, elephants to Escherichia Coli, and man to mushroom.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent of Question 3 is similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the information contained in every cell to create and duplicate itself, implying the uniqueness of each living thing. Question 3 asks what dictates the difference between living organisms, which is related to the uniqueness of each living thing.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the information contained in every cell. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar one based on the provided options, I would choose Question 3, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Geckos and grasshoppers, worms and watermelons, elephants and Escherichia Coli, man and mushroom. All so different in form and function, but amazingly the same in how their form and function are determined. First, all these organisms are made of one or more cells, and every cell of every living thing on earth contains all the information it takes to create and duplicate and make variations of itself. That information is stored in a very long but quite simple double molecule called DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic Acid. And the DNA of every living organism is made of chains of four smaller molecules called nucleotides. What dictates the difference between a man and a mushroom is the sequence of these nucleotides in the long DNA chain. The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases, are made of a few carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus atoms, and the molecules look like this. And each of these four bases is attached to an identical backbone molecule, a sugar called deoxyribose - the "D" in DNA - and a phosphate group. Let's simplify these nucleotides and show them like this. So, a single sequence of nucleotides joined by their common sugars would look like this. And the DNA molecule where such sequences are stored looks like this. But how does a simple molecule dictate the form and function of millions of different living things? You can think of DNA as a great library of information, information that is used to do one thing and one thing only: direct the building of different protein molecules. And it's the proteins that build the cells and keep them functioning and changing and reproducing. Here's where the familiar word 'gene' comes in. If your DNA is a library of information, a gene is a book in that library. A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule. Let's say your body needs a particular protein, like insulin. To get it, some of your cells send a protein signal through the bloodstream to the cells in your pancreas, where insulin is made. That signal protein tells other proteins in the cell's nuclei to open up a part of the DNA double helix, the insulin gene, and start making insulin proteins. As soon as enough insulin has been produced, another signal protein comes to the pancreas' cells that tells them to stop making insulin. It's like looking up a book in the DNA library about insulin, and then putting it back when you're done. There are genes in DNA for visible and invisible things that make up your body, like genes for eye color, protein pigments, for skin color, for hair color, for stopping and starting bone growth, for your blood type, for how many fingers or arms and legs you have, for proteins that influence how long you live. Your DNA probably contains between 25 thousand and 40 thousand genes, while the DNA of a worm or a plant or a fruit fly contains about 12 thousand to 20 thousand genes. Some of those genes have quite different sequences of nucleotides than yours, and some are similar to yours. Though it happens infrequently, our own nucleotide sequences can change as the result of spontaneous or environmental damage which might remove or shift a nucleotide position. This changes the gene involved, and can then change the protein. Most of these changes, called mutations, have very little effect on the organism or its descendants. some are mildly damaging, and a few can make the organism better-suited to its environment. It is these tiny changes in DNA gene sequences, happening over millions of years, that create the differences among living organisms, from geckos to grasshoppers. worms to watermelons, elephants to Escherichia Coli, and man to mushroom.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the main greenhouse gas in climate change. So how does CO2 get into our atmosphere? Well, carbon is part of a cycle. It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth's surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth. When this happens, they're compressed under tons of pressure, and turned into carbon-based fossil fuels like oil, coal or natural gas. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been pulling those fossil fuels out of the ground and burning them, activating the stored energy to make electricity and power engines. But the thing is it also releases millions of years worth of stored CO2 back into the air. In addition, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2. But plants do the opposite. Trees suck up huge amounts of CO2, which balances the cycle. Thus, deforestation reduces the plants that store CO2. We're attacking the cycle from both sides. Think of it like a computer.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the main greenhouse gas in climate change. So how does CO2 get into our atmosphere? Well, carbon is part of a cycle. It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth's surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth. When this happens, they're compressed under tons of pressure, and turned into carbon-based fossil fuels like oil, coal or natural gas. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been pulling those fossil fuels out of the ground and burning them, activating the stored energy to make electricity and power engines. But the thing is it also releases millions of years worth of stored CO2 back into the air. In addition, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2. But plants do the opposite. Trees suck up huge amounts of CO2, which balances the cycle. Thus, deforestation reduces the plants that store CO2. We're attacking the cycle from both sides. Think of it like a computer. A computer can operate a few programs at a time, right? Normally, when you've finished with a document, you save, and you close it, so as not to overwork the computer.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why are gas stations always built
right next to other gas stations? Why can I drive for a mile
without finding a coffee shop and then stumble
across three on the same corner? Why do grocery stores,
auto repair shops and restaurants always seem to exist in groups instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community? While there are several factors that might go into deciding
where to place your business, clusters of similar companies can
be explained by a very simple story called Hotelling's Model
of Spatial Competition. Imagine that you sell
ice cream at the beach. Your beach is one mile long
and you have no competition. Where would you place your cart
in order to sell the most product? In the middle. The one-half-mile walk may
be too far for some people at each end of the beach, but your cart serves
as many people as possible. One day you show up at work just as your cousin Teddy
is arriving at the beach with his own ice cream cart. In fact, he's selling exactly the same type
of ice cream as you are. You agree that you will split
the beach in half. In order to ensure that customers
don't have to walk too far you set up your cart a quarter mile
south of the beach center, right in the middle of your territory. Teddy sets up a quarter mile
north of the center, in the middle of Teddy territory. With this agreement, everyone south
of you buys ice cream from you. Everyone north of Teddy buys from him,
and the 50% of beachgoers in between walk to the closest cart. No one walks
more than a quarter of a mile, and both vendors sell
to half of the beachgoers. Game theorists consider
this a socially optimal solution. It minimizes the maximum number
of steps any visitor must take in order to reach an ice cream cart. The next day, when you arrive at work, Teddy has set up his cart
in the middle of the beach. You return to your location
a quarter mile south of center and get the 25% of customers
to the south of you. Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory, but now you split the 25% of people
in between the two carts. Day three of the ice cream wars,
you get to the beach early, and set up right in the center
of Teddy territory, assuming you'll serve
the 75% of beachgoers to your south, leaving your cousin to sell
to the 25% of customers to the north. When Teddy arrives,
he sets up just south of you stealing all of the southerly customers, and leaving you with a small group
of people to the north. Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces
south of Teddy to regain your customers. When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you, and again, steals back all the customers
to the far end of the beach. Throughout the course of the day, both of you continue
to periodically move south towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers, until both of you eventually end up
at the center of the beach, back to back, each serving 50%
of the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers. At this point, you
and your competitive cousin have reached what game theorists
call a Nash Equilibrium - the point where neither of you
can improve your position by deviating from your current strategy. Your original strategy, where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach, didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium. Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream. With both of you now
in the center of the beach, you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers without making your current
customers worse off. However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution, since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat. Think about all the fast food chains, clothing boutiques,
or mobile phone kiosks at the mall. Customers may be better served by distributing services
throughout a community, but this leaves businesses vulnerable
to aggressive competition. In the real world, customers come
from more than one direction, and businesses are free to compete
with marketing strategies, by differentiating their product line,
and with price cuts, but at the heart of their strategy, companies like to keep their competition
as close as possible.

call a Nash Equilibrium - the point where neither of you
can improve your position by deviating from your current strategy. Your original strategy, where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach, didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium. Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream. With both of you now
in the center of the beach, you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers without making your current
customers worse off. However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution, since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat. Think about all the fast food chains, clothing boutiques,
or mobile phone kiosks at the mall. Customers may be better served by distributing services
throughout a community, but this leaves businesses vulnerable
to aggressive competition. In the real world, customers come
from more than one direction, and businesses are free to compete
with marketing strategies, by differentiating their product line,
and with price cuts, but at the heart of their strategy, companies like to keep their competition
as close as possible.

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why are gas stations always built
right next to other gas stations? Why can I drive for a mile
without finding a coffee shop and then stumble
across three on the same corner? Why do grocery stores,
auto repair shops and restaurants always seem to exist in groups instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community? While there are several factors that might go into deciding
where to place your business, clusters of similar companies can
be explained by a very simple story called Hotelling's Model
of Spatial Competition. Imagine that you sell
ice cream at the beach. Your beach is one mile long
and you have no competition. Where would you place your cart
in order to sell the most product? In the middle. The one-half-mile walk may
be too far for some people at each end of the beach, but your cart serves
as many people as possible. One day you show up at work just as your cousin Teddy
is arriving at the beach with his own ice cream cart. In fact, he's selling exactly the same type
of ice cream as you are. You agree that you will split
the beach in half. In order to ensure that customers
don't have to walk too far you set up your cart a quarter mile
south of the beach center, right in the middle of your territory. Teddy sets up a quarter mile
north of the center, in the middle of Teddy territory. With this agreement, everyone south
of you buys ice cream from you. Everyone north of Teddy buys from him,
and the 50% of beachgoers in between walk to the closest cart. No one walks
more than a quarter of a mile, and both vendors sell
to half of the beachgoers. Game theorists consider
this a socially optimal solution. It minimizes the maximum number
of steps any visitor must take in order to reach an ice cream cart. The next day, when you arrive at work, Teddy has set up his cart
in the middle of the beach. You return to your location
a quarter mile south of center and get the 25% of customers
to the south of you. Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory, but now you split the 25% of people
in between the two carts. Day three of the ice cream wars,
you get to the beach early, and set up right in the center
of Teddy territory, assuming you'll serve
the 75% of beachgoers to your south, leaving your cousin to sell
to the 25% of customers to the north. When Teddy arrives,
he sets up just south of you stealing all of the southerly customers, and leaving you with a small group
of people to the north. Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces
south of Teddy to regain your customers. When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you, and again, steals back all the customers
to the far end of the beach. Throughout the course of the day, both of you continue
to periodically move south towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers, until both of you eventually end up
at the center of the beach, back to back, each serving 50%
of the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers. At this point, you
and your competitive cousin have reached what game theorists
call a Nash Equilibrium - the point where neither of you
can improve your position by deviating from your current strategy. Your original strategy, where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach, didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium. Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream. With both of you now
in the center of the beach, you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers without making your current
customers worse off. However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution, since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat. Think about all the fast food chains, clothing boutiques,

as close as possible.

**Transcript**:
Think about how your favorite stories hook you. "When he was nearly 13, my brother Jim got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jim's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self conscious about his injury." "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his." "My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than 'Pip.' So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip." Imagery, intrigue, emotion: each introduction makes you want to read more. If you have an assignment to write a literary analysis, your introduction will be just as important. There will be four elements in your essay: your introduction, thesis statement, analysis and conclusion. If you begin writing a literary analysis with the introduction, you may be discouraged. Here's a tip for writing a great introduction: Write it last, and write your thesis first. Figure out what you want to analyze before you actually analyze it. Your thesis is the foundation for the rest of your essay, including your introduction. So how do you find your thesis? Start by asking questions. To Charles Dickens you may ask, "why do you draw attention to characters' hands?" "What's up with their names?" "Pumblechook? Really?" To narrow your concept for analysis, answer the questions yourself. "Estella ridicules Pip's hands, Jaggers constantly washes his hands, Pip insufferably burns his hands, Mrs. Joe brings Pip up by hand." Are there patterns in your answers? "Estella's comments smack of cruelty, while Jaggers' cleanses his immoral conscience. Pip finds a second chance, while Mrs. Joe abuses a child under the guise of love and dedication." What can you analyze with this pattern? "Hands symbolize social class inequities, and through Dickens' criticism, he exposes the dire need for reform in Victorian London. What you will do next, which is an entirely different lesson, is to draft and revise your analysis. Only after you write your analysis, return to your introduction. Like authors earlier, try to intrigue and inspire your reader. Avoid starting with famous quotations, dictionary definitions or rhetorical questions. Consider the historical context of your topic, or an anecdote or some larger idea or concept. Here's an example: "27 bones in the hand and wrist allow humans to concurrently create and destroy. Thousands of hands have been behind history's astounding creations. Hands represent a powerful symbol, one that was not lost on Charles Dickens. In Great Expectations, Dickens uses hands to symbolize social class inequities, and through his criticism, he exposes the dire need for social reform in Victorian London." Take time crafting and revising your thesis and introduction. Remember, if you are bored while writing, your reader will be bored while reading. By the way, did you notice the introduction to this lesson? It didn't start with "here's how to write a thesis and introduction." Would that have hooked you?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the four elements that a literary analysis should include, and the correct answer is "Hyperbole" as it is NOT one of the four elements.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: "What is the relationship between the thesis statement and the introduction?" However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the components of a literary analysis essay. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the four elements of a literary analysis essay.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2: "What is the recommended approach to writing a literary analysis essay?" This question is related to the components of a literary analysis essay, but it does not directly ask about the four elements.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ, but Question 2 is the closest match.

Consider the historical context of your topic, or an anecdote or some larger idea or concept. Here's an example: "27 bones in the hand and wrist allow humans to concurrently create and destroy. Thousands of hands have been behind history's astounding creations. Hands represent a powerful symbol, one that was not lost on Charles Dickens. In Great Expectations, Dickens uses hands to symbolize social class inequities, and through his criticism, he exposes the dire need for social reform in Victorian London." Take time crafting and revising your thesis and introduction. Remember, if you are bored while writing, your reader will be bored while reading. By the way, did you notice the introduction to this lesson? It didn't start with "here's how to write a thesis and introduction." Would that have hooked you?

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Think about how your favorite stories hook you. "When he was nearly 13, my brother Jim got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jim's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self conscious about his injury." "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his." "My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than 'Pip.' So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip." Imagery, intrigue, emotion: each introduction makes you want to read more. If you have an assignment to write a literary analysis, your introduction will be just as important. There will be four elements in your essay: your introduction, thesis statement, analysis and conclusion. If you begin writing a literary analysis with the introduction, you may be discouraged. Here's a tip for writing a great introduction: Write it last, and write your thesis first. Figure out what you want to analyze before you actually analyze it. Your thesis is the foundation for the rest of your essay, including your introduction. So how do you find your thesis? Start by asking questions. To Charles Dickens you may ask, "why do you draw attention to characters' hands?" "What's up with their names?" "Pumblechook? Really?" To narrow your concept for analysis, answer the questions yourself. "Estella ridicules Pip's hands, Jaggers constantly washes his hands, Pip insufferably burns his hands, Mrs. Joe brings Pip up by hand." Are there patterns in your answers? "Estella's comments smack of cruelty, while Jaggers' cleanses his immoral conscience. Pip finds a second chance, while Mrs. Joe abuses a child under the guise of love and dedication." What can you analyze with this pattern? "Hands symbolize social class inequities, and through Dickens' criticism, he exposes the dire need for reform in Victorian London. What you will do next, which is an entirely different lesson, is to draft and revise your analysis. Only after you write your analysis, return to your introduction. Like authors earlier, try to intrigue and inspire your reader. Avoid starting with famous quotations, dictionary definitions or rhetorical questions.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. 

Although the options do not exactly match, the intent and content of the question are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the consequence of being bored while writing, and the correct answer is that the reader will also be bored. Question 10 asks about the importance of taking time to craft and revise the thesis and introduction, and the correct answer (although not explicitly stated) implies that a well-crafted thesis and introduction will make the essay more engaging and effective, which is related to the idea that if the writer is bored, the reader will also be bored.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Circus music) [Ted N' Ed's Carnival] [John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible] [Adapted from a TEDTalk
given by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker
has spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, "What is invisible?" There's more of it
than you think, actually. Everything, I would say --
everything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears. In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic
substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. One of the interesting things
about invisibility is, the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand. It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds, when we can touch each other,
taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion which some claim
is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works. Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see
is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,
it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,
but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,
the less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient
for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,
except in your memory. One of the interesting
things about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, "Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two? And I said, "Yes." He said, "Why can't I?" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body remains from what was there
seven years ago. The question is:
who then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller
than the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word
called "blas," meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading
honey, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves
because they radiated. Somebody said to him,
"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?" And he said, "Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything." And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:
"What's another thing we can't see?" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions
really worth asking. "Why are we here?", and "What should
we do about it while we are?" To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, "I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves." (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here
on Earth to help others. What the others
are here for, I've no idea." (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and idea.

The ground truth MCQ discusses the idea that the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears, which is a concept mentioned in the transcript. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 2 mentions the idea of invisibility and its impact on our lives.

Although Question 2 does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of theme and idea. However, I must emphasize that the options provided in Question 2 do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would suggest Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

has spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, "What is invisible?" There's more of it
than you think, actually. Everything, I would say --
everything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears. In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic
substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. One of the interesting things
about invisibility is, the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand. It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds, when we can touch each other,
taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion which some claim
is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works. Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see
is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,
it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,
but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,
the less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient
for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,
except in your memory. One of the interesting
things about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, "Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two? And I said, "Yes." He said, "Why can't I?" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body remains from what was there
seven years ago. The question is:
who then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller
than the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word
called "blas," meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading
honey, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves
because they radiated. Somebody said to him,
"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?" And he said, "Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything." And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:
"What's another thing we can't see?" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions
really worth asking. "Why are we here?", and "What should
we do about it while we are?" To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, "I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves." (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here
on Earth to help others. What the others
are here for, I've no idea." (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music)

and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, "I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves." (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here

**Transcript**:
Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Circus music) [Ted N' Ed's Carnival] [John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible] [Adapted from a TEDTalk
given by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker
has spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, "What is invisible?" There's more of it
than you think, actually. Everything, I would say --
everything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears. In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic
substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. One of the interesting things
about invisibility is, the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand. It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds, when we can touch each other,
taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion which some claim
is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works. Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see
is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,
it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,
but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,
the less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient
for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,
except in your memory. One of the interesting
things about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, "Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two? And I said, "Yes." He said, "Why can't I?" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body remains from what was there
seven years ago. The question is:
who then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller
than the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word
called "blas," meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading
honey, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves
because they radiated. Somebody said to him,
"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?" And he said, "Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything." And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:
"What's another thing we can't see?" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions
really worth asking. "Why are we here?", and "What should
we do about it while we are?" To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, "I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves." (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here
on Earth to help others. What the others

**Transcript**:
You've probably seen
an email or an internet post about how weird and random
English spelling seems to be. But what if I told you that it
actually makes perfect sense? In fact, that's spelling's job: Making sense. Think of spelling a word as peeling back the layers of an onion. The first layer
is a word's sense and meaning. Often there are multiple
layers of meaning. Another layer is the word's structure. Think of the center of the onion
as a word's base element, its essential kernel of meaning. A free-base element, like O-N-E, or T-W-O, can stand on its own as a word, like one, or two. A bound base, like the R-U-P-T
of "erupt" or "rupture" needs another element in order
to surface in a word. Two or more bases give us compounds, like "twofold"
or "someone" or "bankrupt." Once we figure
out a word's meaningful elements, We can peel back its history
to shed a little more light on why it's spelled as it is. The word "two," for example, needs its "W" in order
to mark its connection to words like "twice," "twelve," "twenty," "twin" and "between." A word's history
is another layer of the onion. With that understanding,
let's investigate the word "one." First we need to check
in with what it means. Unique, single, solitary. "One's" historical layers
include its relatives "only," "once," "eleven," and even "a," "an" and "any." But it's the morphological relatives - the ones that share the base O-N-E - That are really astonishing. There are the familiar
ones, like "anyone," and "one-track" and "oneself"
- those are obvious. But let's take a look
at some unexpected derivations of the word "one." The word "alone" is built from the prefix
A-L plus the base O-N-E. It's the same A-L prefix that we see in "always," "already,"
"almighty" and "almost." It means "all." the word "alone" means "all one." It was misanalysed in the middle ages as having the prefix "a," like in "asleep"
and "awake" and "around," and a new base was born: L-O-N-E, which then developed into its own family. In the word "atone," we find
the familiar preposition "at" compounded with the base O-N-E. See, when we atone for something
we've done wrong, we attempt to make things whole again, to fix what's broken, to be
at one again with whomever we hurt. But here's perhaps the best one of all: the word "onion," which is also
frequently derided as irregular or crazy, for its spelling
of "uh" with an O. But again, if we look
into the word's structure, and its history, it's a mystery no more. When we look at the roots of an onion, we learn that it is written
as O-N-E plus I-O-N, the same suffix we find
in "tension," "action," "union" and thousands of other words in English. Unlike the many cloves
in a head of garlic, an onion has a single bulb. It is marked by the state
or condition of oneness. Like an onion, English is one - one single writing system
shared across time and space. Its structure and its
history have many layers, and peeling them apart can really
add flavor to our language and spice up our understanding. See,
spelling is never just about spelling, but about how written words make sense. It's almost enough to make
you want to cry.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What is the purpose of peeling back the layers of a word's structure and history?**

Although the wording of this question is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the primary purpose of the English spelling system, and the correct answer is "To make sense and meaning." Question 9 asks about the purpose of peeling back the layers of a word's structure and history, and the correct answer would be related to understanding the word's meaning and significance, which is closely related to the concept of making sense and meaning.

The other generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ as closely, either because they focus on specific aspects of word structure or history, or because they do not capture the overall purpose of the English spelling system.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

Although the question is not an exact match, the concept of a "free-base element" is closely related to the idea of a word's "base element" being its essential kernel of meaning. The options in Question 2 also touch on the idea of a base element that can stand on its own as a word, which aligns with the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the essential kernel of meaning in a written word. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Given the available options, I would recommend Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
You've probably seen
an email or an internet post about how weird and random
English spelling seems to be. But what if I told you that it
actually makes perfect sense? In fact, that's spelling's job: Making sense. Think of spelling a word as peeling back the layers of an onion. The first layer
is a word's sense and meaning. Often there are multiple
layers of meaning. Another layer is the word's structure. Think of the center of the onion
as a word's base element, its essential kernel of meaning. A free-base element, like O-N-E, or T-W-O, can stand on its own as a word, like one, or two. A bound base, like the R-U-P-T
of "erupt" or "rupture" needs another element in order
to surface in a word. Two or more bases give us compounds, like "twofold"
or "someone" or "bankrupt." Once we figure
out a word's meaningful elements, We can peel back its history
to shed a little more light on why it's spelled as it is. The word "two," for example, needs its "W" in order
to mark its connection to words like "twice," "twelve," "twenty," "twin" and "between." A word's history
is another layer of the onion. With that understanding,
let's investigate the word "one." First we need to check
in with what it means. Unique, single, solitary. "One's" historical layers
include its relatives "only," "once," "eleven," and even "a," "an" and "any." But it's the morphological relatives - the ones that share the base O-N-E - That are really astonishing. There are the familiar
ones, like "anyone," and "one-track" and "oneself"
- those are obvious. But let's take a look
at some unexpected derivations of the word "one." The word "alone" is built from the prefix
A-L plus the base O-N-E. It's the same A-L prefix that we see in "always," "already,"
"almighty" and "almost." It means "all." the word "alone" means "all one." It was misanalysed in the middle ages as having the prefix "a," like in "asleep"
and "awake" and "around," and a new base was born: L-O-N-E, which then developed into its own family. In the word "atone," we find
the familiar preposition "at" compounded with the base O-N-E. See, when we atone for something
we've done wrong, we attempt to make things whole again, to fix what's broken, to be
at one again with whomever we hurt. But here's perhaps the best one of all: the word "onion," which is also
frequently derided as irregular or crazy, for its spelling
of "uh" with an O. But again, if we look
into the word's structure, and its history, it's a mystery no more. When we look at the roots of an onion, we learn that it is written
as O-N-E plus I-O-N, the same suffix we find
in "tension," "action," "union" and thousands of other words in English. Unlike the many cloves
in a head of garlic, an onion has a single bulb. It is marked by the state
or condition of oneness. Like an onion, English is one - one single writing system
shared across time and space. Its structure and its
history have many layers, and peeling them apart can really
add flavor to our language and spice up our understanding. See,
spelling is never just about spelling, but about how written words make sense. It's almost enough to make
you want to cry.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: What is the meaning of the prefix "A-L" in the word "alone"? 

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and the options provided are related to the analysis of word structure and history, which is the main idea of the ground truth MCQ. However, a more suitable match is found in the options of Question 5, where the origin of the word "atone" is discussed in relation to the base "one", similar to how the ground truth MCQ discusses the history of the base element "one" in relation to the word "alone".

But the most suitable match is Question 5's discussion of the word "atone" is not as strong as the match found in the discussion of the word "alone" in the transcript, which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

A stronger match is found in the discussion of the word "alone" in the transcript which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, and that discussion is not present in the generated MCQs, but the closest generated MCQ related to the word "alone" is the one discussing the prefix "A-L" in question 4.

However the best answer is Question 5, because the ground truth MCQ discusses the history of the base element in relation to the word "alone" and how a new base was born from the misanalysis of "alone" which is closely related to how the word "atone" is also derived from the base "one" as discussed in question 5.

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we talk, sometimes
we say things directly. "I'm going to the store,
I'll be back in five minutes." Other times though, we talk in a way
that conjures up a small scene. "It's raining cats and dogs out," we say, or "I was waiting
for the other shoe to drop." Metaphors are a way
to talk about one thing by describing something else. That may seem roundabout, but it's not. Seeing and hearing and tasting
are how we know anything first. The philosopher William James
described the world of newborn infants as a "buzzing and blooming confusion." Abstract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees and blossoms. Metaphors think
with the imagination and the senses. The hot chili peppers in them
explode in the mouth and the mind. They're also precise. We don't really stop
to think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog, but as soon as I do, I realize that I'm quite certain
the dog has to be a small one -- a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund -- and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland. I think a beagle might be about right. A metaphor isn't true or untrue
in any ordinary sense. Metaphors are art, not science, but they can still feel right or wrong. A metaphor that isn't good
leaves you confused. You know what it means
to feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like
to be tired as a whale. There's a paradox to metaphors. They almost always
say things that aren't true. If you say, "there's
an elephant in the room," there isn't an actual one, looking for the peanut dish on the table. Metaphors get under your skin
by ghosting right past the logical mind. Plus, we're used to thinking in images. Every night we dream impossible things. And when we wake up,
that way of thinking's still in us. We take off our dream shoes, and button ourselves into our lives. Some metaphors
include the words "like" or "as." "Sweet as honey," "strong as a tree." Those are called similes. A simile is a metaphor
that admits it's making a comparison. Similes tend to make you think. Metaphors let you feel things directly. Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor, "All the world's a stage." "The world is like a stage"
just seems thinner, and more boring. Metaphors can also live in verbs. Emily Dickinson begins a poem, "I saw no way --
the heavens were stitched --" and we know instantly what it would feel like
if the sky were a fabric sewn shut. They can live in adjectives, too. "Still waters run deep,"
we say of someone quiet and thoughtful. And the deep matters
as much as the stillness and the water do. One of the clearest places
to find good metaphors is in poems. Take this haiku by the 18th-century
Japanese poet Issa. "On a branch floating downriver,
a cricket singing." The first way to meet a metaphor
is just to see the world through its eyes: an insect sings from a branch
passing by in the middle of the river. Even as you see that though, some part of you recognizes in the image a small portrait of what it's like
to live in this world of change and time, our human fate is to vanish,
as surely as that small cricket will, and still, we do what it does. We live, we sing. Sometimes a poem
takes a metaphor and extends it, building on one idea in many ways. Here's the beginning
of Langston Hughes' famous poem "Mother to Son." "Well, son, I'll tell you. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor." Langston Hughes is making
a metaphor that compares a hard life to a wrecked house
you still have to live in. Those splinters and tacks feel real, they hurt your own feet
and your own heart, but the mother
is describing her life here, not her actual house. And hunger, and cold,
exhausting work and poverty are what's also inside those splinters. Metaphors aren't always
about our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches, and then moves on." The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door
of what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world
that only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world.

**Transcript**:
Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we talk, sometimes
we say things directly. "I'm going to the store,
I'll be back in five minutes." Other times though, we talk in a way
that conjures up a small scene. "It's raining cats and dogs out," we say, or "I was waiting
for the other shoe to drop." Metaphors are a way
to talk about one thing by describing something else. That may seem roundabout, but it's not. Seeing and hearing and tasting
are how we know anything first. The philosopher William James
described the world of newborn infants as a "buzzing and blooming confusion." Abstract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees and blossoms. Metaphors think
with the imagination and the senses. The hot chili peppers in them
explode in the mouth and the mind. They're also precise. We don't really stop
to think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog, but as soon as I do, I realize that I'm quite certain
the dog has to be a small one -- a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund -- and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland. I think a beagle might be about right. A metaphor isn't true or untrue
in any ordinary sense. Metaphors are art, not science, but they can still feel right or wrong. A metaphor that isn't good
leaves you confused. You know what it means
to feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like
to be tired as a whale. There's a paradox to metaphors. They almost always
say things that aren't true. If you say, "there's
an elephant in the room," there isn't an actual one, looking for the peanut dish on the table. Metaphors get under your skin
by ghosting right past the logical mind. Plus, we're used to thinking in images. Every night we dream impossible things. And when we wake up,
that way of thinking's still in us. We take off our dream shoes, and button ourselves into our lives. Some metaphors
include the words "like" or "as." "Sweet as honey," "strong as a tree." Those are called similes. A simile is a metaphor
that admits it's making a comparison. Similes tend to make you think. Metaphors let you feel things directly. Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor, "All the world's a stage." "The world is like a stage"
just seems thinner, and more boring. Metaphors can also live in verbs. Emily Dickinson begins a poem, "I saw no way --
the heavens were stitched --" and we know instantly what it would feel like
if the sky were a fabric sewn shut. They can live in adjectives, too. "Still waters run deep,"
we say of someone quiet and thoughtful. And the deep matters
as much as the stillness and the water do. One of the clearest places
to find good metaphors is in poems. Take this haiku by the 18th-century
Japanese poet Issa. "On a branch floating downriver,
a cricket singing." The first way to meet a metaphor
is just to see the world through its eyes: an insect sings from a branch
passing by in the middle of the river. Even as you see that though, some part of you recognizes in the image a small portrait of what it's like
to live in this world of change and time, our human fate is to vanish,
as surely as that small cricket will, and still, we do what it does. We live, we sing. Sometimes a poem
takes a metaphor and extends it, building on one idea in many ways. Here's the beginning
of Langston Hughes' famous poem "Mother to Son." "Well, son, I'll tell you. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor." Langston Hughes is making
a metaphor that compares a hard life to a wrecked house
you still have to live in. Those splinters and tacks feel real, they hurt your own feet
and your own heart, but the mother
is describing her life here, not her actual house. And hunger, and cold,
exhausting work and poverty are what's also inside those splinters. Metaphors aren't always
about our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches, and then moves on." The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door
of what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world
that only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that shares a similar intent and concept.

The ground truth MCQ is about understanding the metaphorical expression "An elephant in the room" and its meaning. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this expression, Question 7: "What is the paradox of metaphors, according to the transcript?" touches on the idea that metaphors often say things that aren't true but can still convey a meaning or feeling.

Although not a perfect match, I would recommend Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the concept of metaphors conveying meaning beyond their literal interpretation.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the mother in Langston Hughes' poem "Mother to Son" and asks about her character, while the generated MCQs are about metaphors, their functions, effects, and examples.

However, Question 5 is the closest in terms of content, as it mentions an example of a metaphor given in the transcript, which includes Langston Hughes' poem "Mother to Son" in the surrounding context. But the question intent and options are still quite different.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, but it's still not a good match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we talk, sometimes
we say things directly. "I'm going to the store,
I'll be back in five minutes." Other times though, we talk in a way
that conjures up a small scene. "It's raining cats and dogs out," we say, or "I was waiting
for the other shoe to drop." Metaphors are a way
to talk about one thing by describing something else. That may seem roundabout, but it's not. Seeing and hearing and tasting
are how we know anything first. The philosopher William James
described the world of newborn infants as a "buzzing and blooming confusion." Abstract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees and blossoms. Metaphors think
with the imagination and the senses. The hot chili peppers in them
explode in the mouth and the mind. They're also precise. We don't really stop
to think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog, but as soon as I do, I realize that I'm quite certain
the dog has to be a small one -- a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund -- and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland. I think a beagle might be about right. A metaphor isn't true or untrue
in any ordinary sense. Metaphors are art, not science, but they can still feel right or wrong. A metaphor that isn't good
leaves you confused. You know what it means
to feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like
to be tired as a whale. There's a paradox to metaphors. They almost always
say things that aren't true. If you say, "there's
an elephant in the room," there isn't an actual one, looking for the peanut dish on the table. Metaphors get under your skin
by ghosting right past the logical mind. Plus, we're used to thinking in images. Every night we dream impossible things. And when we wake up,
that way of thinking's still in us. We take off our dream shoes, and button ourselves into our lives. Some metaphors
include the words "like" or "as." "Sweet as honey," "strong as a tree." Those are called similes. A simile is a metaphor
that admits it's making a comparison. Similes tend to make you think. Metaphors let you feel things directly. Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor, "All the world's a stage." "The world is like a stage"
just seems thinner, and more boring. Metaphors can also live in verbs. Emily Dickinson begins a poem, "I saw no way --
the heavens were stitched --" and we know instantly what it would feel like
if the sky were a fabric sewn shut. They can live in adjectives, too. "Still waters run deep,"
we say of someone quiet and thoughtful. And the deep matters
as much as the stillness and the water do. One of the clearest places
to find good metaphors is in poems. Take this haiku by the 18th-century
Japanese poet Issa. "On a branch floating downriver,
a cricket singing." The first way to meet a metaphor
is just to see the world through its eyes: an insect sings from a branch
passing by in the middle of the river. Even as you see that though, some part of you recognizes in the image a small portrait of what it's like
to live in this world of change and time, our human fate is to vanish,
as surely as that small cricket will, and still, we do what it does. We live, we sing. Sometimes a poem
takes a metaphor and extends it, building on one idea in many ways. Here's the beginning
of Langston Hughes' famous poem "Mother to Son." "Well, son, I'll tell you. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor." Langston Hughes is making
a metaphor that compares a hard life to a wrecked house
you still have to live in. Those splinters and tacks feel real, they hurt your own feet
and your own heart, but the mother
is describing her life here, not her actual house. And hunger, and cold,
exhausting work and poverty are what's also inside those splinters. Metaphors aren't always
about our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches, and then moves on." The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door
of what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world
that only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world.

**Transcript**:
In the early days of organic chemistry, chemists understood
that molecules were made of atoms connected through chemical bonds. However, the three-dimensional
shapes of molecules were utterly unclear, since they couldn't
be observed directly. Molecules were represented using
simple connectivity graphs like the one you see here. It was clear to savvy chemists
of the mid-19th century that these flat representations
couldn't explain many of their observations. But chemical theory hadn't provided
a satisfactory explanation for the three-dimensional
structures of molecules. In 1874, the chemist Van't Hoff
published a remarkable hypothesis: the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom point to the corners of a tetrahedron. It would take over 25 years for the quantum revolution
to theoretically validate his hypothesis. But Van't Hoff supported
his theory using optical rotation. Van't Hoff noticed that only compounds
containing a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups rotated plane-polarized light. Clearly there's something unique
about this class of compounds. Take a look at the two molecules
you see here. Each one is characterized
by a central, tetrahedral carbon atom bound to four different atoms: bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and hydrogen. We might be tempted to conclude
that the two molecules are the same, if we just concern
ourselves with what they're made of. However, let's see if we can
overlay the two molecules perfectly to really prove
that they're the same. We have free license to rotate
and translate both of the molecules as we wish. Remarkably though, no matter how we move the molecules, we find that perfect superposition
is impossible to achieve. Now take a look at your hands. Notice that your two hands
have all the same parts: a thumb, fingers, a palm, etc. Like our two molecules under study, both of your hands are made
of the same stuff. Furthermore, the distances between stuff
in both of your hands are the same. The index finger
is next to the middle finger, which is next to the ring finger, etc. The same is true
of our hypothetical molecules. All of their internal distances are the same. Despite
the similarities between them, your hands, and our molecules, are certainly not the same. Try superimposing
your hands on one another. Just like our molecules from before, you'll find that it can't
be done perfectly. Now, point your palms toward one another. Wiggle both of your index fingers. Notice that your left hand
looks as if it's looking in a mirror at your right. In other words, your hands
are mirror images. The same can be said of our molecules. We can turn them so
that one looks at the other as in a mirror. Your hands
- and our molecules - possess a spatial property
in common called chirality, or handedness. Chirality means exactly
what we've just described: a chiral object is not
the same as its mirror image. Chiral objects are very special
in both chemistry and everyday life. Screws, for example, are also chiral. That's why we need the terms
right-handed and left-handed screws. And believe it or not,
certain types of light can behave like chiral screws. Packed into every linear,
plane-polarized beam of light are right-handed and left-handed parts that rotate together
to produce plane polarization. Chiral molecules, placed
in a beam of such light, interact differently
with the two chiral components. As a result, one component of the light
gets temporarily slowed down relative to the other. The
effect on the light beam is a rotation of its plane
from the original one, otherwise known as optical rotation. Van't Hoff and later chemists
realized that the chiral nature of tetrahedral carbons can explain
this fascinating phenomenon. Chirality is responsible for all kinds
of other fascinating effects in chemistry, and everyday life. Humans tend to love symmetry and so if you look around you,
you'll find that chiral objects made by humans are rare. But chiral molecules
are absolutely everywhere. Phenomena as separate as optical rotation, Screwing together furniture, and clapping your hands all involve this intriguing
spatial property.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, its content and options are the most similar. Question 3 asks about the unique property of compounds containing a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups, which is related to van't Hoff's theory concerning the geometry of saturated carbon atoms. The correct answer to Question 3, "They rotate plane-polarized light," is also related to the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ, "optical rotation." 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that asks about the phenomenon used by van't Hoff to support his theory, with options that include optical rotation and other relevant concepts.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 2: Who published a hypothesis about the three-dimensional structures of molecules in 1874?

Although this question does not directly ask about the geometry of the atom, it does mention Van't Hoff's hypothesis, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, it would be more accurate to generate a new set of MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. However, if you insist on an index, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 2 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example of a generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: What geometry did Van't Hoff propose for the carbon atom in chiral compounds?
Options: A. Linear, B. Bent, C. Trigonal planar, D. Tetrahedral, E. T-shaped

**Transcript**:
In the early days of organic chemistry, chemists understood
that molecules were made of atoms connected through chemical bonds. However, the three-dimensional
shapes of molecules were utterly unclear, since they couldn't
be observed directly. Molecules were represented using
simple connectivity graphs like the one you see here. It was clear to savvy chemists
of the mid-19th century that these flat representations
couldn't explain many of their observations. But chemical theory hadn't provided
a satisfactory explanation for the three-dimensional
structures of molecules. In 1874, the chemist Van't Hoff
published a remarkable hypothesis: the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom point to the corners of a tetrahedron. It would take over 25 years for the quantum revolution
to theoretically validate his hypothesis. But Van't Hoff supported
his theory using optical rotation. Van't Hoff noticed that only compounds
containing a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups rotated plane-polarized light. Clearly there's something unique
about this class of compounds. Take a look at the two molecules
you see here. Each one is characterized
by a central, tetrahedral carbon atom bound to four different atoms: bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and hydrogen. We might be tempted to conclude
that the two molecules are the same, if we just concern
ourselves with what they're made of. However, let's see if we can
overlay the two molecules perfectly to really prove
that they're the same. We have free license to rotate
and translate both of the molecules as we wish. Remarkably though, no matter how we move the molecules, we find that perfect superposition
is impossible to achieve. Now take a look at your hands. Notice that your two hands
have all the same parts: a thumb, fingers, a palm, etc. Like our two molecules under study, both of your hands are made
of the same stuff. Furthermore, the distances between stuff
in both of your hands are the same. The index finger
is next to the middle finger, which is next to the ring finger, etc. The same is true
of our hypothetical molecules. All of their internal distances are the same. Despite
the similarities between them, your hands, and our molecules, are certainly not the same. Try superimposing
your hands on one another. Just like our molecules from before, you'll find that it can't
be done perfectly. Now, point your palms toward one another. Wiggle both of your index fingers. Notice that your left hand
looks as if it's looking in a mirror at your right. In other words, your hands
are mirror images. The same can be said of our molecules. We can turn them so
that one looks at the other as in a mirror. Your hands
- and our molecules - possess a spatial property
in common called chirality, or handedness. Chirality means exactly
what we've just described: a chiral object is not
the same as its mirror image. Chiral objects are very special
in both chemistry and everyday life. Screws, for example, are also chiral. That's why we need the terms
right-handed and left-handed screws. And believe it or not,
certain types of light can behave like chiral screws. Packed into every linear,
plane-polarized beam of light are right-handed and left-handed parts that rotate together
to produce plane polarization. Chiral molecules, placed
in a beam of such light, interact differently
with the two chiral components. As a result, one component of the light
gets temporarily slowed down relative to the other. The
effect on the light beam is a rotation of its plane
from the original one, otherwise known as optical rotation. Van't Hoff and later chemists
realized that the chiral nature of tetrahedral carbons can explain
this fascinating phenomenon. Chirality is responsible for all kinds
of other fascinating effects in chemistry, and everyday life. Humans tend to love symmetry and so if you look around you,
you'll find that chiral objects made by humans are rare. But chiral molecules
are absolutely everywhere. Phenomena as separate as optical rotation, Screwing together furniture, and clapping your hands all involve this intriguing
spatial property.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although the question and options are not identical, the content and intent of Question 3 are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Question 3 asks about the unique property of compounds containing a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups, which is related to the concept of chirality and the requirement that the four groups attached to a chiral carbon must be different.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 3 do not directly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the requirement for the four groups attached to a chiral carbon, with options that include the correct answer "they all must be different". Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

Therefore, while Question 3 is the most similar, it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed that it's harder 
to start pedaling your bicycle than it is to ride at a constant speed? Or wondered what causes your bicycle to move? Or thought about why it goes forward 
instead of backwards or sideways? Perhaps not, and you wouldn't be alone. It wasn't until the 17th century that Isaac Newton described 
the fundamental laws of motion and we understood the answer 
to these three questions. What Newton recognized was that 
things tend to keep on doing what they are already doing. 
So when your bicycle is stopped, it stays stopped, and when it is going, it stays going. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest. That's Newton's First Law. Physicists call it the Law of Inertia, 
which is a fancy way of saying that moving objects don't spontaneously 
speed up, slow down, or change direction. It is this inertia that you must overcome 
to get your bicycle moving. Now you know that you have to overcome 
inertia to get your bicycle moving, but what is it that allows you to overcome it? Well, the answer is explained by Newton's Second Law. In mathematical terms, Newton's Second Law says that force is the product of mass times acceleration. To cause an object to accelerate, or speed up, a force must be applied. The more force you apply, the quicker you accelerate. 
And the more mass your bicycle has, and the more mass you have too, the more force you have to use 
to accelerate at the same rate. This is why it would be really difficult 
to pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle. And it is this force, which is applied 
by your legs pushing down on the pedals, that allows you to overcome Newton's Law of Inertia. The harder you push down on the pedals, 
the bigger the force and the quicker you accelerate. Now on to the final question: When you do get your bike moving, why does it go forward? According to Newton's Third Law, 
for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. To understand this, think about what 
happens when you drop a bouncy ball. As the bouncy ball hits the floor, it causes a downward force on the floor. This is the action. The floor reacts by pushing 
on the ball with the same force, but in the opposite direction, upward, causing it to bounce back up to you. Together, the floor and the ball form what's called the action/reaction pair. 
When it comes to your bicycle, it is a little more complicated. 
As your bicycle wheels spin clockwise, the parts of each tire 
touching the ground push backwards against the Earth: the actions. The ground pushes 
forward with the same force against each of your tires: the reactions. Since you have two bicycle tires, 
each one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward.

each one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward.

**Question 5: What is the action/reaction pair in the case of a bouncy ball hitting the floor?**

Although this question does not directly ask about Newton's Third Law, it does relate to the concept of action and reaction, which is the core idea of Newton's Third Law. However, a more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about Newton's Third Law.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly ask about Newton's Third Law. However, I can suggest an alternative approach to identify a suitable match.

**Alternative Match: Question 6: What is the action/reaction pair in the case of a bicycle wheel spinning clockwise and touching the ground?**

This question is related to Newton's Third Law, as it describes an action/reaction pair. However, it does not directly ask about the law itself.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would select **Question 6** as the closest match, despite it not being a perfect match.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would recommend generating new MCQs that directly ask about Newton's Third Law, as none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed that it's harder 
to start pedaling your bicycle than it is to ride at a constant speed? Or wondered what causes your bicycle to move? Or thought about why it goes forward 
instead of backwards or sideways? Perhaps not, and you wouldn't be alone. It wasn't until the 17th century that Isaac Newton described 
the fundamental laws of motion and we understood the answer 
to these three questions. What Newton recognized was that 
things tend to keep on doing what they are already doing. 
So when your bicycle is stopped, it stays stopped, and when it is going, it stays going. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest. That's Newton's First Law. Physicists call it the Law of Inertia, 
which is a fancy way of saying that moving objects don't spontaneously 
speed up, slow down, or change direction. It is this inertia that you must overcome 
to get your bicycle moving. Now you know that you have to overcome 
inertia to get your bicycle moving, but what is it that allows you to overcome it? Well, the answer is explained by Newton's Second Law. In mathematical terms, Newton's Second Law says that force is the product of mass times acceleration. To cause an object to accelerate, or speed up, a force must be applied. The more force you apply, the quicker you accelerate. 
And the more mass your bicycle has, and the more mass you have too, the more force you have to use 
to accelerate at the same rate. This is why it would be really difficult 
to pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle. And it is this force, which is applied 
by your legs pushing down on the pedals, that allows you to overcome Newton's Law of Inertia. The harder you push down on the pedals, 
the bigger the force and the quicker you accelerate. Now on to the final question: When you do get your bike moving, why does it go forward? According to Newton's Third Law, 
for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. To understand this, think about what 
happens when you drop a bouncy ball. As the bouncy ball hits the floor, it causes a downward force on the floor. This is the action. The floor reacts by pushing 
on the ball with the same force, but in the opposite direction, upward, causing it to bounce back up to you. Together, the floor and the ball form what's called the action/reaction pair. 
When it comes to your bicycle, it is a little more complicated. 
As your bicycle wheels spin clockwise, the parts of each tire 
touching the ground push backwards against the Earth: the actions. The ground pushes 
forward with the same force against each of your tires: the reactions. Since you have two bicycle tires, 
each one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward.

Today we're talking about weird materials that we use in space, in robots
and in your mouth. I'm talking about shape memory alloys. Like the name says, these are metals that remember different shapes. To understand how these metals work, we've got to talk about atoms and organizing. Let's talk about atoms first. Atoms are tiny bits of matter
that you cannot see with your eye yet they make up everything in our world, from the chair that you're sitting on
to your cell phone. Atoms have some surprising ways of behaving too. We'll talk about that shortly. Now, how big is an atom? Well, imagine pulling one of your hairs
out of your head and whittling it like a stick 100,000 times. One of those shavings 
would be the width of an atom. They're that small. Now let's talk about atoms and organizing. You may not know this,
but atoms arrange themselves similar to the way we humans arrange ourselves. Sometimes they sit in rows, like we do on a bus or an airplane. We call that seating arrangement a phase. Other times they sit diagonal from each other, sort of like seats in a movie theater or sports stadium. This is another phase. When atoms move from one seating to another this is called a phase change. Phase changes are all around us. You may already know about water's phases: solid, liquid and gas. Many other materials have phases like that too. Some of them have several solid phases. OK. Back to those shape memory alloys
we mentioned before. When we say that the metals 
remember their different shapes, what we're really saying is they
remember different seating arrangements of atoms. When the atoms rearrange, the metal moves from one shape to another. Let's look at a phase change in action. Here I have a metal wire that 
is made out of nickel and titanium. This metal wire is a shape memory alloy, and I'm going to make it switch
between its different shapes using heat from a lighter. Watch this. I'm going to wrap this wire around my finger and then heat it. Amazing! That wire returns to a straight line,
when I heat it. Let's try that again. I'm going to wrap it around my finger,
and heat it. Yep, that's still amazing. Not only is it amazing, this is weird, because metals generally don't do that. Here's a paper clip. When I heat it, I get nothing. What we're seeing is the shape memory wire
changing phases when it gets hot. When the wire is cold, atoms 
are in a diagonal arrangement, like the movie theater seating,
we talked about before. We call this a monoclinic arrangement, and scientists will call this phase martensite. When I heated up the wire, the atoms moved into columns like airplane seating. This is a cubic arrangement. Scientists will call this phase austenite. So when we added the heat, 
the atoms shifted positions seamlessly, and they'll do this forever. They have this coordinated motion, 
just like members of a tireless marching band. Each makes a small shift, but all 
together those small shifts create a totally different pattern. So that's pretty cool, but
where do we use these materials? Well, if you look in the sky tonight, shape memory alloys are at work - on Mars. They're used to move 
panels on the Mars rover, so that it can study the environment. Like our metal straightened when it was heated, the metals holding the panels
will move when electrically heated. When we stop heating the shape memory metal, the panel will return back,
due to an opposing spring. Back on Earth, shape memory alloys
are used to open up clogged arteries as stents, which are small collapsible springs that force open passages. Shape memory alloys are also used to move robots, toy butterflies, teeth in braces,
and for a perfect fit every time, shape memory wires are used 
as underwires in bras. Now you know Victoria's secret. By popping a bra into the dryer, 
it'll be brand new every time. So whether it's on Mars or in your mouth,
small atomic movements can create huge changes, and understanding the way atoms behave allows us to make materials 
that make our world a better place.

**Transcript**:
Today we're talking about weird materials that we use in space, in robots
and in your mouth. I'm talking about shape memory alloys. Like the name says, these are metals that remember different shapes. To understand how these metals work, we've got to talk about atoms and organizing. Let's talk about atoms first. Atoms are tiny bits of matter
that you cannot see with your eye yet they make up everything in our world, from the chair that you're sitting on
to your cell phone. Atoms have some surprising ways of behaving too. We'll talk about that shortly. Now, how big is an atom? Well, imagine pulling one of your hairs
out of your head and whittling it like a stick 100,000 times. One of those shavings 
would be the width of an atom. They're that small. Now let's talk about atoms and organizing. You may not know this,
but atoms arrange themselves similar to the way we humans arrange ourselves. Sometimes they sit in rows, like we do on a bus or an airplane. We call that seating arrangement a phase. Other times they sit diagonal from each other, sort of like seats in a movie theater or sports stadium. This is another phase. When atoms move from one seating to another this is called a phase change. Phase changes are all around us. You may already know about water's phases: solid, liquid and gas. Many other materials have phases like that too. Some of them have several solid phases. OK. Back to those shape memory alloys
we mentioned before. When we say that the metals 
remember their different shapes, what we're really saying is they
remember different seating arrangements of atoms. When the atoms rearrange, the metal moves from one shape to another. Let's look at a phase change in action. Here I have a metal wire that 
is made out of nickel and titanium. This metal wire is a shape memory alloy, and I'm going to make it switch
between its different shapes using heat from a lighter. Watch this. I'm going to wrap this wire around my finger and then heat it. Amazing! That wire returns to a straight line,
when I heat it. Let's try that again. I'm going to wrap it around my finger,
and heat it. Yep, that's still amazing. Not only is it amazing, this is weird, because metals generally don't do that. Here's a paper clip. When I heat it, I get nothing. What we're seeing is the shape memory wire
changing phases when it gets hot. When the wire is cold, atoms 
are in a diagonal arrangement, like the movie theater seating,
we talked about before. We call this a monoclinic arrangement, and scientists will call this phase martensite. When I heated up the wire, the atoms moved into columns like airplane seating. This is a cubic arrangement. Scientists will call this phase austenite. So when we added the heat, 
the atoms shifted positions seamlessly, and they'll do this forever. They have this coordinated motion, 
just like members of a tireless marching band. Each makes a small shift, but all 
together those small shifts create a totally different pattern. So that's pretty cool, but
where do we use these materials? Well, if you look in the sky tonight, shape memory alloys are at work - on Mars. They're used to move 
panels on the Mars rover, so that it can study the environment. Like our metal straightened when it was heated, the metals holding the panels
will move when electrically heated. When we stop heating the shape memory metal, the panel will return back,
due to an opposing spring. Back on Earth, shape memory alloys
are used to open up clogged arteries as stents, which are small collapsible springs that force open passages. Shape memory alloys are also used to move robots, toy butterflies, teeth in braces,
and for a perfect fit every time, shape memory wires are used 
as underwires in bras. Now you know Victoria's secret. By popping a bra into the dryer, 
it'll be brand new every time. So whether it's on Mars or in your mouth,
small atomic movements can create huge changes, and understanding the way atoms behave allows us to make materials 
that make our world a better place.

Transcriber: Ido Dekkers
Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo So what is gravity? I bet most of you think it's: "What goes up, must come down!" Is that right? Well, sorta, but not really. Technically, the law of gravity is an equation. It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between them squared. That was easy, right? Probably not. What does this actually mean? Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else. What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects, they are attracted to each other. OK. Let's try and wrap our minds around this. What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff? It falls to the earth. Right? Well, yes, but something else happens. You see, the law of gravity says that both objects, the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other. This means that the rock falls towards the earth, and the earth falls towards the rock. Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses. The earth is much much much more massive than the rock, so it moves a very very small distance, and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther with respect to the earth. Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars. It turns out they will be attracted to each other. I'm not talking about that kind of attraction. See, they have mass, and since they have mass, they will move towards each other. They are attracted to each other. Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets? You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles? When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other, they move together. They are attracted to each other. And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction. Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets. Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same, they just behave in a similar way. Let's think of one other thing - astronauts. You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon than on the earth. Why is that? Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth. Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. It's like the moon is a weaker magnet. They aren't as attracted to each other. Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet. The pull of the magnets towards each other are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity. For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth. It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system. It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away, so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak, it is a long ways away. Therefore the attraction isn't as strong. So let's look back at that law of gravity. The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2. You see the force of gravity is equal to a number. That's that universal gravitational constant G times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two. Think of M1 being the mass of the sun and M2 being the mass of the earth. And then we divide by the distance between them squared. This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth. You could just as easily plug in your mass and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth, and find out how much you are attracted to the earth, and the earth attracted to you. So, what's gravity? Everything is attracted to everything else. Everything. Oh, one last thing, just to make you wonder. What causes gravity? Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other? Well, the answer is - We don't know. The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists. We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity. It is one of the great mysteries of science.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo So what is gravity? I bet most of you think it's: "What goes up, must come down!" Is that right? Well, sorta, but not really. Technically, the law of gravity is an equation. It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between them squared. That was easy, right? Probably not. What does this actually mean? Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else. What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects, they are attracted to each other. OK. Let's try and wrap our minds around this. What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff? It falls to the earth. Right? Well, yes, but something else happens. You see, the law of gravity says that both objects, the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other. This means that the rock falls towards the earth, and the earth falls towards the rock. Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses. The earth is much much much more massive than the rock, so it moves a very very small distance, and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther with respect to the earth. Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars. It turns out they will be attracted to each other. I'm not talking about that kind of attraction. See, they have mass, and since they have mass, they will move towards each other. They are attracted to each other. Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets? You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles? When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other, they move together. They are attracted to each other. And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction. Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets. Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same, they just behave in a similar way. Let's think of one other thing - astronauts. You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon than on the earth. Why is that? Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth. Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. It's like the moon is a weaker magnet. They aren't as attracted to each other. Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet. The pull of the magnets towards each other are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity. For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth. It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system. It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away, so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak, it is a long ways away. Therefore the attraction isn't as strong. So let's look back at that law of gravity. The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2. You see the force of gravity is equal to a number. That's that universal gravitational constant G times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two. Think of M1 being the mass of the sun and M2 being the mass of the earth. And then we divide by the distance between them squared. This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth. You could just as easily plug in your mass and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth, and find out how much you are attracted to the earth, and the earth attracted to you. So, what's gravity? Everything is attracted to everything else. Everything. Oh, one last thing, just to make you wonder. What causes gravity? Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other? Well, the answer is - We don't know. The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists. We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity. It is one of the great mysteries of science.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 3: "According to the transcript, what happens when you drop a rock off a cliff?"

However, since Question 3 does not directly address the scenario of two teenagers with equal mass in space, it is not an exact match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the concept of attraction between two objects, I would choose Question 8: "What is the relationship between the mass of an object and its gravitational pull, according to the transcript?" or Question 5: "What is the analogy used in the transcript to help understand gravity?" (which discusses the attraction between two magnets).

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no exact match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not among the provided options, but if I had to choose, I would say it is: Question 3.

However, I must note that it would be best to generate a new MCQ that directly addresses the scenario of two teenagers with equal mass in space.

But if I had to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I would say: 3

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the options of Question 8 do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an explanation for my choice.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "What is gravity?" with options that describe the concept of gravity. Question 8 asks about the relationship between the mass of an object and its gravitational pull, but it indirectly relates to the concept of gravity.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks, "What is gravity?" with similar options. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would suggest Question 8, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
You know, back in the '40s and '50s, the original standard television 
had a 4 to 3 width to height ratio. That shape was chosen 
to be a slight rectangle, but still mostly square, thus having 
the maximal screen area for the given dimensions. And that's still the ratio on many TVs 
and computer monitors in today's homes. The problem is, hardly anybody today 
treats video content in a 4 to 3 ratio. See, this whole problem started when people wanted 
to watch movies from the theater in the comfort of their own homes. Movie screens are considerably larger 
than our home television. More important, the screen 
is completely different rectangle and can't mathematically fit 
on our TV screens without manipulation. A typical TV is one and a third times
wider than it is tall Some movie screens could be up to 
three times as wide as it is tall. So what're we going to do to make it fit? 
Well, we have all kinds of options. Well, we could squeeze and stretch 
and mangle everything onto the screen, to make it all fill up, and everyone would look
ridiculously thin and compressed. The good news is
the sound would be just fine, although I don't think people would be 
too happy about that option, particularly the actors in the movie. We could just cut a chunk 
of the original movie like a cookie cutter and just see that frame of the movie. The problem with that would be 
people and objects would be speaking from off the screen,
or, even worse, they might be cut in half. Some movie editors use what's called
the "pan and scan" technique to allow the full height 
of the TV screen to be used, but pick and choose what section 
of the original movie should be shown on your screen thus eliminating the annoying 
cutting of people. Imagine that job: staring at a 4 to 3 hole watching movies all day, 
deciding for everyone which piece of the screen is
the most important part for people to see. Now let's do a little quick math. If we compare a major cinematic film 
produced on a 2.35 to 1 aspect frame with my standard 4 to 3 TV screen, we find out that only 55% of the movie 
can actually fit on the screen at any one time. Just over half! You've seen the disclaimer 
at the beginning of the movie on TV or DVD that says, 
"This film has been modified from its original format 
to fit on your TV screen." Well, what it should say is, "We are only displaying 55% 
of the movie of our choosing." Now for all the full-screen TV lovers, this is your dilemma: do you want to see all the movie, 
or is 55% good enough? How about new TVs? Around the start of the century, 
some widescreen TVs emerged in a 16 to 9, or 1.78 times 
wider than it is tall. Well, this screen fits 
the movie a little better, but still only shows 75% 
of the original movie at one time. Suppose someone made 
a TV for your living room that was actually 2.35 to 1 
to show those full movies? Well, the TV with the same height 
as the most current 50-inch TVs - that TV would be close to six feet long. And on top of that, you'd only use 
the full screen when you watched movies. Most of the other content 
would have to be stretched, or have empty space on 
the sides of the screen. Of course, there is one more option. We can just shrink
the movie screen proportionally, to fit the width of your home television. We can mathematically scale the original 
to fit exactly the width of the screen and this'll preserve 
the entire movie screen, but show the infamous black bars
along the top and bottom that so many television watchers abhor. Of course, now you can argue 
that we're only using 75% of that screen. And that is where the real question is: do you want your full screen, 
or do you want to see the entire movie? Most likely, you just need a bigger TV.

a TV for your living room that was actually 2.35 to 1 
to show those full movies? Well, the TV with the same height 
as the most current 50-inch TVs - that TV would be close to six feet long. And on top of that, you'd only use 
the full screen when you watched movies. Most of the other content 
would have to be stretched, or have empty space on 
the sides of the screen. Of course, there is one more option. We can just shrink
the movie screen proportionally, to fit the width of your home television. We can mathematically scale the original 
to fit exactly the width of the screen and this'll preserve 
the entire movie screen, but show the infamous black bars
along the top and bottom that so many television watchers abhor. Of course, now you can argue 
that we're only using 75% of that screen. And that is where the real question is: do you want your full screen, 
or do you want to see the entire movie? Most likely, you just need a bigger TV.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You know, back in the '40s and '50s, the original standard television 
had a 4 to 3 width to height ratio. That shape was chosen 
to be a slight rectangle, but still mostly square, thus having 
the maximal screen area for the given dimensions. And that's still the ratio on many TVs 
and computer monitors in today's homes. The problem is, hardly anybody today 
treats video content in a 4 to 3 ratio. See, this whole problem started when people wanted 
to watch movies from the theater in the comfort of their own homes. Movie screens are considerably larger 
than our home television. More important, the screen 
is completely different rectangle and can't mathematically fit 
on our TV screens without manipulation. A typical TV is one and a third times
wider than it is tall Some movie screens could be up to 
three times as wide as it is tall. So what're we going to do to make it fit? 
Well, we have all kinds of options. Well, we could squeeze and stretch 
and mangle everything onto the screen, to make it all fill up, and everyone would look
ridiculously thin and compressed. The good news is
the sound would be just fine, although I don't think people would be 
too happy about that option, particularly the actors in the movie. We could just cut a chunk 
of the original movie like a cookie cutter and just see that frame of the movie. The problem with that would be 
people and objects would be speaking from off the screen,
or, even worse, they might be cut in half. Some movie editors use what's called
the "pan and scan" technique to allow the full height 
of the TV screen to be used, but pick and choose what section 
of the original movie should be shown on your screen thus eliminating the annoying 
cutting of people. Imagine that job: staring at a 4 to 3 hole watching movies all day, 
deciding for everyone which piece of the screen is
the most important part for people to see. Now let's do a little quick math. If we compare a major cinematic film 
produced on a 2.35 to 1 aspect frame with my standard 4 to 3 TV screen, we find out that only 55% of the movie 
can actually fit on the screen at any one time. Just over half! You've seen the disclaimer 
at the beginning of the movie on TV or DVD that says, 
"This film has been modified from its original format 
to fit on your TV screen." Well, what it should say is, "We are only displaying 55% 
of the movie of our choosing." Now for all the full-screen TV lovers, this is your dilemma: do you want to see all the movie, 
or is 55% good enough? How about new TVs? Around the start of the century, 
some widescreen TVs emerged in a 16 to 9, or 1.78 times 
wider than it is tall. Well, this screen fits 
the movie a little better, but still only shows 75% 
of the original movie at one time. Suppose someone made 
a TV for your living room that was actually 2.35 to 1 
to show those full movies? Well, the TV with the same height 
as the most current 50-inch TVs - that TV would be close to six feet long. And on top of that, you'd only use 
the full screen when you watched movies. Most of the other content 
would have to be stretched, or have empty space on 
the sides of the screen. Of course, there is one more option. We can just shrink
the movie screen proportionally, to fit the width of your home television. We can mathematically scale the original 
to fit exactly the width of the screen and this'll preserve 
the entire movie screen, but show the infamous black bars
along the top and bottom that so many television watchers abhor. Of course, now you can argue 
that we're only using 75% of that screen. And that is where the real question is: do you want your full screen, 
or do you want to see the entire movie? Most likely, you just need a bigger TV.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Although Question 3 does not ask about the exact ratio of movie screens, it does discuss the main problem with watching movies on a 4:3 TV screen, which is related to the fact that movie screens have a different aspect ratio.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the aspect ratio of movie screens. Since none of the generated MCQs ask this question directly, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

That being said, if I had to choose one of the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but only in terms of discussing the general topic of TV and movie screen aspect ratios.

But actually the best match is: 
 Question 9: What is the problem with making a TV with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio to show full movies? Options: A. It would be too expensive, B. It would be too small, C. It would be too long and most content would have to be stretched or have empty space on the sides, D. It would be too heavy 

This question contains information about the aspect ratio of a movie screen (2.35 to 1), which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Whether you like it or not,
we use numbers every day. Some numbers, such as the speed of sound, are small and easy to work with. Other numbers, such as the speed of light, are much larger
and cumbersome to work with. We can use scientific notation
to express these large numbers in a much more manageable format. So we can write
299,792,458 meters per second as 3.0 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second. Correct scientific notation requires that the first term
range in value so that it is greater than one
but less than 10, and the second term represents
the power of 10 or order of magnitude by which we multiply the first term. We can use the power of 10 as a tool
in making quick estimations when we do not need or care
for the exact value of a number. For example, the diameter of an atom is approximately 10 to the power
of negative 12 meters. The height of a tree is approximately
10 to the power of one meter. The diameter of the Earth is approximately
10 to the power of seven meters. The ability to use the power of 10
as an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again, like when you're trying to guess
the number of M&M's in a jar, but is also an essential skill
in math and science, especially when dealing with
what are known as Fermi problems. Fermi problems are named
after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who's famous for making rapid
order-of-magnitude estimations, or rapid estimations,
with seemingly little available data. Fermi worked on the Manhattan Project
in developing the atomic bomb, and when it was tested
at the Trinity site in 1945, Fermi dropped a few pieces
of paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled
backwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion
as 10 kilotons of TNT, which is on the same order of magnitude
as the actual value of 20 kilotons. One example of the classic
Fermi estimation problems is to determine
how many piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago, Illinois. At first, there seem to be
so many unknowns that the problem appears to be unsolvable. That is the perfect application
for a power-of-10 estimation, as we don't need an exact answer - an estimation will work. We can start by determining how many
people live in the city of Chicago. We know that it is a large city, but we may be unsure about exactly
how many people live in the city. Are the one million people?
Five million people? This is the point in the problem where many people become frustrated
with the uncertainty, but we can easily get through this
by using the power of 10. We can estimate the magnitude
of the population of Chicago as 10 to the power of six. While this doesn't tell us exactly
how many people live there, it serves an accurate estimation
for the actual population of just under three million people. So if there are approximately
10 to the sixth people in Chicago, how many pianos are there? If we want to continue
dealing with orders of magnitude, we can either say that one out of 10 or one out of one hundred
people own a piano. Given that our estimate of the population
includes children and adults, we'll go with the latter estimate, which estimates that there are
approximately 10 to the fourth, or 10,000 pianos, in Chicago. With this many pianos,
how many piano tuners are there? We could begin the process of thinking
about how often the pianos are tuned, how many pianos are tuned in one day, or how many days a piano tuner works, but that's not the point
of rapid estimation. We instead think in orders of magnitude, and say that a piano tuner tunes roughly
10 to the second pianos in a given year, which is approximately
a few hundred pianos. Given our previous estimate
of 10 to the fourth pianos in Chicago, and the estimate that each piano tuner can
tune 10 to the second pianos each year, we can say that there are approximately
10 to the second piano tuners in Chicago. Now, I know what you must be thinking: How can all of these estimates
produce a reasonable answer? Well, it's rather simple. In any Fermi problem, it is assumed that the overestimates and underestimates
balance each other out, and produce an estimation that is usually within one order
of magnitude of the actual answer. In our case we can confirm this
by looking in the phone book for the number of piano tuners
listed in Chicago. What do we find? 81. Pretty incredible, given
our order-of-magnitude estimation. But, hey - that's the power of 10.

**Transcript**:
Whether you like it or not,
we use numbers every day. Some numbers, such as the speed of sound, are small and easy to work with. Other numbers, such as the speed of light, are much larger
and cumbersome to work with. We can use scientific notation
to express these large numbers in a much more manageable format. So we can write
299,792,458 meters per second as 3.0 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second. Correct scientific notation requires that the first term
range in value so that it is greater than one
but less than 10, and the second term represents
the power of 10 or order of magnitude by which we multiply the first term. We can use the power of 10 as a tool
in making quick estimations when we do not need or care
for the exact value of a number. For example, the diameter of an atom is approximately 10 to the power
of negative 12 meters. The height of a tree is approximately
10 to the power of one meter. The diameter of the Earth is approximately
10 to the power of seven meters. The ability to use the power of 10
as an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again, like when you're trying to guess
the number of M&M's in a jar, but is also an essential skill
in math and science, especially when dealing with
what are known as Fermi problems. Fermi problems are named
after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who's famous for making rapid
order-of-magnitude estimations, or rapid estimations,
with seemingly little available data. Fermi worked on the Manhattan Project
in developing the atomic bomb, and when it was tested
at the Trinity site in 1945, Fermi dropped a few pieces
of paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled
backwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion
as 10 kilotons of TNT, which is on the same order of magnitude
as the actual value of 20 kilotons. One example of the classic
Fermi estimation problems is to determine
how many piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago, Illinois. At first, there seem to be
so many unknowns that the problem appears to be unsolvable. That is the perfect application
for a power-of-10 estimation, as we don't need an exact answer - an estimation will work. We can start by determining how many
people live in the city of Chicago. We know that it is a large city, but we may be unsure about exactly
how many people live in the city. Are the one million people?
Five million people? This is the point in the problem where many people become frustrated
with the uncertainty, but we can easily get through this
by using the power of 10. We can estimate the magnitude
of the population of Chicago as 10 to the power of six. While this doesn't tell us exactly
how many people live there, it serves an accurate estimation
for the actual population of just under three million people. So if there are approximately
10 to the sixth people in Chicago, how many pianos are there? If we want to continue
dealing with orders of magnitude, we can either say that one out of 10 or one out of one hundred
people own a piano. Given that our estimate of the population
includes children and adults, we'll go with the latter estimate, which estimates that there are
approximately 10 to the fourth, or 10,000 pianos, in Chicago. With this many pianos,
how many piano tuners are there? We could begin the process of thinking
about how often the pianos are tuned, how many pianos are tuned in one day, or how many days a piano tuner works, but that's not the point
of rapid estimation. We instead think in orders of magnitude, and say that a piano tuner tunes roughly
10 to the second pianos in a given year, which is approximately
a few hundred pianos. Given our previous estimate
of 10 to the fourth pianos in Chicago, and the estimate that each piano tuner can
tune 10 to the second pianos each year, we can say that there are approximately
10 to the second piano tuners in Chicago. Now, I know what you must be thinking: How can all of these estimates
produce a reasonable answer? Well, it's rather simple. In any Fermi problem, it is assumed that the overestimates and underestimates
balance each other out, and produce an estimation that is usually within one order
of magnitude of the actual answer. In our case we can confirm this
by looking in the phone book for the number of piano tuners
listed in Chicago. What do we find? 81. Pretty incredible, given
our order-of-magnitude estimation. But, hey - that's the power of 10.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the speed of light, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to scientific notation, Fermi problems, and estimation.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of numbers and values, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but only in terms of the topic of estimation and calculation, not in terms of the specific question about the speed of light.

Therefore, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 6 is the closest, but still not a good match.

Index: 6 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
OK, today we're going
to talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:
"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes
in the ground and destroys gardens." And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth
on your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept
that we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything
extremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms
there are in the universe? Or in your body? Or
even in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted
to answer that question, but how do you count something
as small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea
that if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same
temperature and pressure, they would contain an equal
number of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took
him to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists
didn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way
to prove he was right. There was no clear difference
between atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work
as purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!
By late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,
and his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,
Avogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount
of particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas
at zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,
then you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion
gas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros
after it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space
due to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you
thinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams
of water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,
which is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion
molecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro
was the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this
number has a second name. The mole. Chemists use the term mole to refer to the quantities
that are at the magnitude of 602 sextillion. This is known as a molar quantity. Atoms and molecules are so small, that chemists
have bundled them into groups called moles. Moles are hard for students to understand
because they have a hard time picturing the size of a mole, or of 602 sextillion. It's just too big to wrap
our brains around. Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water? Well, that's a mole of water. But how much is that? Exactly what does 602
sextillion look like? Maybe this'll help. Exchange the water particles for donuts. If you had a mole of donuts,
they would cover the entire earth to a depth of eight kilometers, which is about five miles. You really need a lot of coffee for that. If you had a mole of basketballs,
you could create a new planet the size of the earth. If you received a mole of pennies on the day
you were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age
of 100, you would still have more than 99.99% of your money in the bank. OK. Now we sort of have an idea
how large the mole is. So how do we use it? You might be surprised to know
that chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy
grapes, deli meat, or eggs. When you go to the grocery store,
you don't go to the deli counter and ask for 43 slices of salami,
you buy your salami by the pound. When you buy your eggs,
you buy a dozen eggs. When we hear the word dozen,
we probably think of the number 12. We also know that a pair is two, a baker's dozen is 13, a gross is 144, and a ream
of paper is - anybody? A ream is 500. Well, a mole is really the same thing. For a chemist, a mole conjures
up the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal.
The only difference is that the other quantities
are more familiar to us. So there you have it -
the story of the mole, Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy
salami at the grocery store.

**Transcript**:
OK, today we're going
to talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:
"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes
in the ground and destroys gardens." And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth
on your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept
that we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything
extremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms
there are in the universe? Or in your body? Or
even in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted
to answer that question, but how do you count something
as small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea
that if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same
temperature and pressure, they would contain an equal
number of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took
him to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists
didn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way
to prove he was right. There was no clear difference
between atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work
as purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!
By late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,
and his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,
Avogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount
of particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas
at zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,
then you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion
gas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros
after it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space
due to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you
thinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams
of water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,
which is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion
molecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro
was the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What is Avogadro's number? Options: A. 6.02 x 10^22, B. 6.02 x 10^23, C. 6.02 x 10^24, D. 6.02 x 10^25.

However, the question is asking for another name for the mole, not Avogadro's number itself. But among the given options, this question is the closest match because Avogadro's number is indeed another name for the mole.

A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks for another name for the mole. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Considering the available options, I would choose Question 3 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
OK, today we're going
to talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:
"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes
in the ground and destroys gardens." And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth
on your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept
that we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything
extremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms
there are in the universe? Or in your body? Or
even in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted
to answer that question, but how do you count something
as small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea
that if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same
temperature and pressure, they would contain an equal
number of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took
him to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists
didn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way
to prove he was right. There was no clear difference
between atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work
as purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!
By late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,
and his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,
Avogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount
of particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas
at zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,
then you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion
gas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros
after it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space
due to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you
thinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams
of water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,
which is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion
molecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro
was the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this
number has a second name. The mole. Chemists use the term mole to refer to the quantities
that are at the magnitude of 602 sextillion. This is known as a molar quantity. Atoms and molecules are so small, that chemists
have bundled them into groups called moles. Moles are hard for students to understand
because they have a hard time picturing the size of a mole, or of 602 sextillion. It's just too big to wrap
our brains around. Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water? Well, that's a mole of water. But how much is that? Exactly what does 602
sextillion look like? Maybe this'll help. Exchange the water particles for donuts. If you had a mole of donuts,
they would cover the entire earth to a depth of eight kilometers, which is about five miles. You really need a lot of coffee for that. If you had a mole of basketballs,
you could create a new planet the size of the earth. If you received a mole of pennies on the day
you were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age
of 100, you would still have more than 99.99% of your money in the bank. OK. Now we sort of have an idea
how large the mole is. So how do we use it? You might be surprised to know
that chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy
grapes, deli meat, or eggs. When you go to the grocery store,
you don't go to the deli counter and ask for 43 slices of salami,
you buy your salami by the pound. When you buy your eggs,
you buy a dozen eggs. When we hear the word dozen,
we probably think of the number 12. We also know that a pair is two, a baker's dozen is 13, a gross is 144, and a ream
of paper is - anybody? A ream is 500. Well, a mole is really the same thing. For a chemist, a mole conjures
up the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal.
The only difference is that the other quantities
are more familiar to us. So there you have it -
the story of the mole, Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy
salami at the grocery store.

What is proof? And why is it so important in mathematics? Proofs provide a solid
foundation for mathematicians logicians, statisticians,
economists, architects, engineers, and many others to build
and test their theories on. And they're just plain awesome! Let me start at the beginning. I'll introduce you
to a fellow named Euclid. As in, "here's looking at you, Clid." He lived in Greece about 2,300 years ago, and he's considered by many to be
the father of geometry. So if you've been wondering where
to send your geometry fan mail, Euclid of Alexandria is the guy
to thank for proofs. Euclid is not really known for inventing
or discovering a lot of mathematics but he revolutionized the way
in which it is written, presented, and thought about. Euclid set out to formalize mathematics
by establishing the rules of the game. These rules of the game are called axioms. Once you have the rules, Euclid says you have to use them
to prove what you think is true. If you can't, then your theorem or idea might be false. And if your theorem is false, then
any theorems that come after it and use it might be false too. Like how one misplaced beam can
bring down the whole house. So that's all that proofs are: using well-established rules to prove
beyond a doubt that some theorem is true. Then you use those theorems like blocks to build mathematics. Let's check out an example. Say I want to prove
that these two triangles are the same size and shape. In other words, they are congruent. Well, one way to do
that is to write a proof that shows that all three sides
of one triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the other triangle. So how do we prove it? First, I'll write down what we know. We know that point M
is the midpoint of AB. We also know that sides AC
and BC are already congruent. Now let's see. What does
the midpoint tell us? Luckily, I know
the definition of midpoint. It is basically the point in the middle. What this means is that AM
and BM are the same length, since M is the exact middle of AB. In other words, the bottom side
of each of our triangles are congruent. I'll put that as step two. Great! So far I have two pairs
of sides that are congruent. The last one is easy. The third side of the left triangle is CM, and the third side
of the right triangle is - well, also CM. They share the same side. Of course it's congruent to itself! This is called the reflexive property. Everything is congruent to itself. I'll put this as step three. Ta dah! You've just proven
that all three sides of the left triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the right triangle. Plus, the two triangles are congruent because of the side-side-side
congruence theorem for triangles. When finished with a proof,
I like to do what Euclid did. He marked the end of a proof
with the letters QED. It's Latin for "quod erat demonstrandum," which translates literally to "what was to be proven." But I just think of it
as "look what I just did!" I can hear what you're thinking: why should I study proofs? One reason is that they could
allow you to win any argument. Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest
leaders of all time used to keep a copy of Euclid's Elements
on his bedside table to keep his mind in shape. Another reason is you can
make a million dollars. You heard me. One million dollars. That's the price that the Clay
Mathematics Institute in Massachusetts is willing to pay anyone who proves
one of the many unproven theories that it calls "the millenium problems." A couple of these have been solved
in the 90s and 2000s. But beyond money and arguments, proofs are everywhere. They underly architecture, art, computer
programming, and internet security. If no one understood
or could generate a proof, we could not advance these
essential parts of our world. Finally, we all know
that the proof is in the pudding. And pudding is delicious. QED.

What is proof? And why is it so important in mathematics? Proofs provide a solid
foundation for mathematicians logicians, statisticians,
economists, architects, engineers, and many others to build
and test their theories on. And they're just plain awesome! Let me start at the beginning. I'll introduce you
to a fellow named Euclid. As in, "here's looking at you, Clid." He lived in Greece about 2,300 years ago, and he's considered by many to be
the father of geometry. So if you've been wondering where
to send your geometry fan mail, Euclid of Alexandria is the guy
to thank for proofs. Euclid is not really known for inventing
or discovering a lot of mathematics but he revolutionized the way
in which it is written, presented, and thought about. Euclid set out to formalize mathematics
by establishing the rules of the game. These rules of the game are called axioms. Once you have the rules, Euclid says you have to use them
to prove what you think is true. If you can't, then your theorem or idea might be false. And if your theorem is false, then
any theorems that come after it and use it might be false too. Like how one misplaced beam can
bring down the whole house. So that's all that proofs are: using well-established rules to prove
beyond a doubt that some theorem is true. Then you use those theorems like blocks to build mathematics. Let's check out an example. Say I want to prove
that these two triangles are the same size and shape. In other words, they are congruent. Well, one way to do
that is to write a proof that shows that all three sides
of one triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the other triangle. So how do we prove it? First, I'll write down what we know. We know that point M
is the midpoint of AB. We also know that sides AC
and BC are already congruent. Now let's see. What does
the midpoint tell us? Luckily, I know
the definition of midpoint. It is basically the point in the middle. What this means is that AM
and BM are the same length, since M is the exact middle of AB. In other words, the bottom side
of each of our triangles are congruent. I'll put that as step two. Great! So far I have two pairs
of sides that are congruent. The last one is easy. The third side of the left triangle is CM, and the third side
of the right triangle is - well, also CM. They share the same side. Of course it's congruent to itself! This is called the reflexive property. Everything is congruent to itself. I'll put this as step three. Ta dah! You've just proven
that all three sides of the left triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the right triangle. Plus, the two triangles are congruent because of the side-side-side
congruence theorem for triangles. When finished with a proof,
I like to do what Euclid did. He marked the end of a proof
with the letters QED. It's Latin for "quod erat demonstrandum," which translates literally to "what was to be proven." But I just think of it
as "look what I just did!" I can hear what you're thinking: why should I study proofs? One reason is that they could
allow you to win any argument. Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest
leaders of all time used to keep a copy of Euclid's Elements
on his bedside table to keep his mind in shape. Another reason is you can
make a million dollars. You heard me. One million dollars. That's the price that the Clay
Mathematics Institute in Massachusetts is willing to pay anyone who proves
one of the many unproven theories that it calls "the millenium problems." A couple of these have been solved
in the 90s and 2000s. But beyond money and arguments, proofs are everywhere. They underly architecture, art, computer
programming, and internet security. If no one understood
or could generate a proof, we could not advance these
essential parts of our world. Finally, we all know
that the proof is in the pudding. And pudding is delicious. QED.

**Transcript**:
Some of the best opportunities to learn are the moments in which we are perplexed. Those moments in which you
begin to wonder and question. These moments have happened
throughout history. and have led to some truly
amazing discoveries. Take this story, for example. There once was a fellow named Archimedes. He was born in 287 B.C. in the city
of Syracuse in Sicily. He was a Greek mathematician,
physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. One day, Archimedes was summoned
by the king of Sicily to investigate if he had
been cheated by a goldsmith. The king said he had given a goldsmith
the exact amount of gold needed to make a crown. However, when the crown was ready, the king
suspected that the goldsmith cheated and slipped some silver into the crown, keeping some of the gold for himself. The king asked Archimedes
to solve the problem. But there was a catch: he couldn't
do any damage to the crown. One day, while taking his bath, Archimedes noticed that the water
level in the bathtub rose and overflowed as he immersed
himself into the tub. He suddenly realized that how much
water was displaced depended on how much
of his body was immersed. This discovery excited him so much
that he jumped out of the tub and ran through the streets
naked, shouting "Eureka!" Which comes from the ancient
Greek meaning "I found it." What did he find? Well, he found a way
to solve the king's problem. You see, Archimedes needed
to check the crown's density to see if it was the same
as the density of pure gold. Density is a measure of an object's mass
divided by its volume. Pure gold is very dense,
while silver is less dense. So if there was silver in the crown, it would be
less dense than if it were made of pure gold. But no matter what it was made of,
the crown would be the same shape, which means the same volume. So if Archimedes could measure
the mass of the crown first, and then measure its volume, he could find out how dense it was. But it is not easy to measure
a crown's volume - it has an irregular shape, that's different
from a simple box or ball. You can't measure its size and multiply
like you might for other shapes. The solution, Archimedes realized, was to give the crown a bath. by placing it in water and seeing
how much water was displaced, he could measure the volume, and he'd calculate
the density of the crown. If the crown was less
dense than pure gold, then the goldsmith most definitely
cheated the king. When Archimedes went back
to the king and did his test, the story says, he found that the goldsmith
had indeed cheated the king, and slipped some silver in. These days, using the way an object displaces
water to measure volume is called Archimedes' principle. The
next time you take a bath, you can see Archimedes'
principle in action, and maybe you'll have
a genius idea of your own.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a method to identify a generated MCQ that might be related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of perplexity or learning opportunities.

The ground truth MCQ is about the moments in which we are perplexed being the best opportunities to learn. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic, Question 3: What did Archimedes discover while taking his bath? could be considered as a moment of perplexity or a learning opportunity for Archimedes.

However, please note that this is a very loose connection, and the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 3 (Index 3) is the closest, but it's not a good match.

**Transcript**:
Some of the best opportunities to learn are the moments in which we are perplexed. Those moments in which you
begin to wonder and question. These moments have happened
throughout history. and have led to some truly
amazing discoveries. Take this story, for example. There once was a fellow named Archimedes. He was born in 287 B.C. in the city
of Syracuse in Sicily. He was a Greek mathematician,
physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. One day, Archimedes was summoned
by the king of Sicily to investigate if he had
been cheated by a goldsmith. The king said he had given a goldsmith
the exact amount of gold needed to make a crown. However, when the crown was ready, the king
suspected that the goldsmith cheated and slipped some silver into the crown, keeping some of the gold for himself. The king asked Archimedes
to solve the problem. But there was a catch: he couldn't
do any damage to the crown. One day, while taking his bath, Archimedes noticed that the water
level in the bathtub rose and overflowed as he immersed
himself into the tub. He suddenly realized that how much
water was displaced depended on how much
of his body was immersed. This discovery excited him so much
that he jumped out of the tub and ran through the streets
naked, shouting "Eureka!" Which comes from the ancient
Greek meaning "I found it." What did he find? Well, he found a way
to solve the king's problem. You see, Archimedes needed
to check the crown's density to see if it was the same
as the density of pure gold. Density is a measure of an object's mass
divided by its volume. Pure gold is very dense,
while silver is less dense. So if there was silver in the crown, it would be
less dense than if it were made of pure gold. But no matter what it was made of,
the crown would be the same shape, which means the same volume. So if Archimedes could measure
the mass of the crown first, and then measure its volume, he could find out how dense it was. But it is not easy to measure
a crown's volume - it has an irregular shape, that's different
from a simple box or ball. You can't measure its size and multiply
like you might for other shapes. The solution, Archimedes realized, was to give the crown a bath. by placing it in water and seeing
how much water was displaced, he could measure the volume, and he'd calculate
the density of the crown. If the crown was less
dense than pure gold, then the goldsmith most definitely
cheated the king. When Archimedes went back
to the king and did his test, the story says, he found that the goldsmith
had indeed cheated the king, and slipped some silver in. These days, using the way an object displaces
water to measure volume is called Archimedes' principle. The
next time you take a bath, you can see Archimedes'
principle in action, and maybe you'll have
a genius idea of your own.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What did Archimedes discover while taking his bath? Options: A. The principle of buoyancy, B. The concept of density, C. The relationship between the water level and the object's volume, D. The formula for calculating the area of a circle.

However, the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that asks about what determines the amount of water displaced. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 10: What can be observed when an object is placed in water, according to Archimedes' principle? Options: A. The object's weight increases, B. The object's volume decreases, C. The water level rises, D. The object's density changes.

This question is related to the concept of water displacement, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ. However, it's still not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
If you think of culture as an iceberg, only a small fraction of it is visible. Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools, are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate. However, only when we look deeper, under the water, are we able to focus on the common values that connect us. In what seems to be an increasingly troubled world, where social and political systems are being stretched, conflict within and between countries is at times heightened, while human rights are being ignored, this desire for peace grows ever stronger. Sometimes we see this common value emerging above the surface and becoming visible. For example, it is part of everyday language used when people greet one another and welcome the new day. In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia, such as Bangladesh for example, the greeting of "as-salamu alaykum" can be translated to "peace be with you." The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan, where greetings of "namaste," which has not only a strong message of peace - "the spirit in me greets the spirit in you" - but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart, to honor a special place in each of us. In Myanmar, greetings of "mingalarbar" are met by bowing monks as they internalize a message where others add blessing to enhance the auspiciousness of the moment, or by giggling children as they scurry off to school. After many hours of hiking through the mountains of Lesotho, surrounded by the tranquility and rugged terrain, you are likely to meet a herdboy who has slept the night in a vacant rondoval and bellows out greetings of "lumela" or "khotso", which means "peace be with you." If you took a moment to research further the meanings behind "shalom," or the Korean greeting, you would find that they too have deeply-seated connections to peace. However, they have become quick comments made to welcome, greet, and say hello, and in this overuse, have likely lost the focus that was originally intended when put into practice hundreds or thousands of years ago. In highlighting this simple evidence of ingrained behavior, we can create the necessary shift in thinking needed to incorporate flexibility and open-mindedness in us all when looking at the globalization of the world.

**Transcript**:
If you think of culture as an iceberg, only a small fraction of it is visible. Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools, are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate. However, only when we look deeper, under the water, are we able to focus on the common values that connect us. In what seems to be an increasingly troubled world, where social and political systems are being stretched, conflict within and between countries is at times heightened, while human rights are being ignored, this desire for peace grows ever stronger. Sometimes we see this common value emerging above the surface and becoming visible. For example, it is part of everyday language used when people greet one another and welcome the new day. In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia, such as Bangladesh for example, the greeting of "as-salamu alaykum" can be translated to "peace be with you." The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan, where greetings of "namaste," which has not only a strong message of peace - "the spirit in me greets the spirit in you" - but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart, to honor a special place in each of us. In Myanmar, greetings of "mingalarbar" are met by bowing monks as they internalize a message where others add blessing to enhance the auspiciousness of the moment, or by giggling children as they scurry off to school. After many hours of hiking through the mountains of Lesotho, surrounded by the tranquility and rugged terrain, you are likely to meet a herdboy who has slept the night in a vacant rondoval and bellows out greetings of "lumela" or "khotso", which means "peace be with you." If you took a moment to research further the meanings behind "shalom," or the Korean greeting, you would find that they too have deeply-seated connections to peace. However, they have become quick comments made to welcome, greet, and say hello, and in this overuse, have likely lost the focus that was originally intended when put into practice hundreds or thousands of years ago. In highlighting this simple evidence of ingrained behavior, we can create the necessary shift in thinking needed to incorporate flexibility and open-mindedness in us all when looking at the globalization of the world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What is the common value that connects people across cultures, according to the transcript? Options: A. Respect for authority, B. Desire for wealth, C. Desire for peace, D. Love for nature.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask for an example to support the argument. Nevertheless, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks for an example of how the desire for peace is evident in everyday life, but such a question is not present in the provided set.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3, but with the caveat that it is not a perfect match.

However, another possible match could be Question 9: What is the significance of highlighting the simple evidence of ingrained behavior in greetings across cultures? Options: A. To show the diversity of cultures, B. To highlight the importance of language, C. To create a shift in thinking towards flexibility and open-mindedness, D. To promote cultural exchange programs.

The ground truth MCQ mentions that Jenkins gives an example to support her argument that the desire for peace is growing stronger. The example is that it is part of everyday language when people greet one another and welcome the new day. Question 9 refers to this example indirectly by mentioning "simple evidence of ingrained behavior in greetings across cultures."

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ could also be 9.

[Music] good morning I would like to discuss with you your place in space now I'm not going to talk about black holes are gonna be no multiverses there will not even be plunk time I'm talking about fundamental astronomy that lets us know where we are in the cosmos our story begins on earth many people you know are from Earth including my father now my father was in law school in 1940 I don't want to shock anybody over here but he didn't really like it so he got a summer job working for the US Navy on earth on Wake Island now Wake Island is in the middle of Pacific Ocean nowhere so my dad was working for a contractor building an airstrip which is still there on Wake Island and they had a great time says it's the greatest summer job he ever had but then in the late fall of 1941 December 7th Wake Island was bombed same day as Pearl Harbor many other Pacific Ocean targets my father and his comrades fought back for two weeks and they shot down at least two Japanese bombers every day for two weeks but they the Japanese Navy eventually showed up with foe Atilla many ships and they captured everybody on Christmas Eve my dad wrote in his diary saddest day of my life well they were taken to China someplace and my dad was in prison camp for almost four years 44 months longer than anyone else from the United States and he had very dark skies at night they had no electricity and the Japanese military confiscated all their jewelry and watches and so on so they had no way to tell time so the family myth is my dad would tell time by sticking a shovel handle in the dirt and watching the shadow he watched the shadows of sticks and Pera they would tell the guard what it was and when it was time to eat lunch and he was also the family myth able to infer when you know the time of year they're able to figure out their latitude so this guy who my dad said wasn't even this tall was able to crawl through a vent in this train car and get back to the east coast of China and make it all the way to the United States and tell everybody what happened because these guys essentially disappeared I mean I don't know why they didn't tweet where they were just or use Facebook but eventually the deal is my dad lived through it and he got back to the states he married his college sweetheart Here I am along with my older brother and sister and through all this my father became fascinated with sundials so yes he created the well known sand dial which you take to the beach so you don't have to get sand in your watch Oh everybody needs one believe me and then he wrote articles for the Washington DC area newspapers and he eventually wrote a book about sundials and that's when he was given a lifetime membership in the North American sundial Society anybody now ecology does tell you there's a lot of CFO's here chief financial officers a lot of operating there's a lot of accountants and you know how the accountants can party it's crazy yeah well let me tell you it when you're with the sundial people it is nuts man I mean everybody's it's movie look it's moving so so I of course was a rebellious teenager and so on but I did notice that last summer I brought out one of the old sand aisles and seemed to still work just fine and someone I know converted a conventional pizza box into a polar sundial now this might be evidence of a Saudi sundial obsessive disorder but I'm fine now I'm fine I could quit if I wanted I just don't want to that's all so I got invited to a meeting many years ago at Cornell University and they had this thing this is the test pattern for the cameras that were going to Mars this is the photometric calibration target and I think you can see their color coupons that you get the colors right and there are three gray rings of different values and so they were casting a shadow with this little metal post so you could look at the color of the Martian sky now if you look at the at a shadow on earth that's something very white you'll see it's blue just a little bit from the Earth's sky so I'm in this meeting and I go you guys we gotta turn the photometric calibration target into a sundial and they're looking at me no you guys it'll be cool we can reckon time on another world it'll be like speaking Klingon except it'll be real and so the head guy Steve Squire said okay so my friends there are two sundials on Mars while we're here so here's what I want you to do when you go to Mars next time and you're standing there you got to take some food and water it's 687 Earth days you will see the Sun make this pattern through the sky as the year goes on if you do it on earth you will see this pattern that's I started on the 2nd of March it'll go north and this pattern is called the analemma the analemma zone Latin word that means the pedestal of niall so what I want you guys to do is to build one of these and so what we have done if you go to our website Planetary org and we'll find the instructions for laying out the lines and getting the hours right for your sundial anywhere in the world you can furnish it anything that's not on the dial to tell time is its furniture you can furnish it with here some sailboats and anchors and here's the traditional latitude and longitude and it's the ping-pong ball is the gnomon because ping-pong balls are available anywhere in the world so we did this back in 2004 when the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars and people all over the world built these but those days webcams were kind of a hassle this year we're hoping it will be really cool so here's what I'm telling you almost everybody has observed the Sun go up and down as the year goes on in the sky very few of us have heard the word analemma yet we all depend on it you go to office supply stores you get your calendars with the kittens and the puppies and the firefighters with no shirts on and all of that has figured out we had a leap day this year all of that is figured out by knowing intimately our relationship to the Sun knowing intimately our place in space so I submit to you my friends if you take the time you can dare I say it change the world thank you all very much thank you [Applause]

for the Washington DC area newspapers and he eventually wrote a book about sundials and that's when he was given a lifetime membership in the North American sundial Society anybody now ecology does tell you there's a lot of CFO's here chief financial officers a lot of operating there's a lot of accountants and you know how the accountants can party it's crazy yeah well let me tell you it when you're with the sundial people it is nuts man I mean everybody's it's movie look it's moving so so I of course was a rebellious teenager and so on but I did notice that last summer I brought out one of the old sand aisles and seemed to still work just fine and someone I know converted a conventional pizza box into a polar sundial now this might be evidence of a Saudi sundial obsessive disorder but I'm fine now I'm fine I could quit if I wanted I just don't want to that's all so I got invited to a meeting many years ago at Cornell University and they had this thing this is the test pattern for the cameras that were going to Mars this is the photometric calibration target and I think you can see their color coupons that you get the colors right and there are three gray rings of different values and so they were casting a shadow with this little metal post so you could look at the color of the Martian sky now if you look at the at a shadow on earth that's something very white you'll see it's blue just a little bit from the Earth's sky so I'm in this meeting and I go you guys we gotta turn the photometric calibration target into a sundial and they're looking at me no you guys it'll be cool we can reckon time on another world it'll be like speaking Klingon except it'll be real and so the head guy Steve Squire said okay so my friends there are two sundials on Mars while we're here so here's what I want you to do when you go to Mars next time and you're standing there you got to take some food and water it's 687 Earth days you will see the Sun make this pattern through the sky as the year goes on if you do it on earth you will see this pattern that's I started on the 2nd of March it'll go north and this pattern is called the analemma the analemma zone Latin word that means the pedestal of niall so what I want you guys to do is to build one of these and so what we have done if you go to our website Planetary org and we'll find the instructions for laying out the lines and getting the hours right for your sundial anywhere in the world you can furnish it anything that's not on the dial to tell time is its furniture you can furnish it with here some sailboats and anchors and here's the traditional latitude and longitude and it's the ping-pong ball is the gnomon because ping-pong balls are available anywhere in the world so we did this back in 2004 when the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars and people all over the world built these but those days webcams were kind of a hassle this year we're hoping it will be really cool so here's what I'm telling you almost everybody has observed the Sun go up and down as the year goes on in the sky very few of us have heard the word analemma yet we all depend on it you go to office supply stores you get your calendars with the kittens and the puppies and the firefighters with no shirts on and all of that has figured out we had a leap day this year all of that is figured out by

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: On a typical sundial, anything that is there that doesn't help you tell time (the decorations, if you will) are called:
Options: A. embellishments, B. furniture, C. elaborations, D. jewelry
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is a sundial, and what is its purpose?
Options: A. A device that measures temperature, used for weather forecasting, B. A device that measures time, used for navigation, C. A device that measures distance, used for mapping, D. A device that measures light, used for photography
Correct Option: None

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.2000 (The generated question does not closely align with the content and intent of the ground truth question. The ground truth question is asking about a specific aspect of sundials, while the generated question is asking about the general purpose of a sundial.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer option in the generated question does not match the ground truth answer.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.5000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible but not directly related to the ground truth question.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.8000 (The question and options in the generated question are clear and understandable, but not directly related to the ground truth question.)
- Total Score: 0.3750

Note: The generated question does not match the ground truth question well, and the correct answer is not present in the generated question. A better-generated question would be one that asks about the term used to describe the decorations on a sundial, with options that include the correct answer "furniture".

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain that we'll label our subconscious. The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens
thousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information
and details from our experience. We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects
that we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions. This is also where
our emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away? Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served. And now this guy
has just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. "That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience. "That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot." And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby, called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor and needs to get
to the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely, and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual. "My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk." But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique
human function of free will. Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations
did you filter in as a result of your beliefs, and why? Are your assumptions valid
and supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings, and result in new and better
conclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs.

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain that we'll label our subconscious. The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens
thousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information
and details from our experience. We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects
that we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions. This is also where
our emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away? Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served. And now this guy
has just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. "That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience. "That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot." And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby, called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor and needs to get
to the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely, and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual. "My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk." But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique
human function of free will. Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations

and supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings, and result in new and better
conclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As you can imagine, 400 years ago, navigating the open ocean was difficult. The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course, and so sailors based their directions on the port they left, attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed. This process was known as dead reckoning, because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon. This was an easy mistake to make. Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible: sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily. All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land. John Bird, an instrument maker in London, made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day, called a sextant. Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time. Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship. Clocks came next. In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter, built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea. The timepiece that could maintain accurate time while on a pitching, yawing deck in harsh conditions was necessary in order to know the time back in England. There was one catch though: since such a timepiece was handmade, it was very expensive. So an alternate method using lunar measurements and intense calculations was often used to cut costs. The calculations to determine a ship's location for each measurement could take hours. But sextants and clocks weren't useful unless sailors could use these tools to determine their position. Fortunately, in the 1600s, an amateur mathematician had invented the missing piece. John Napier toiled for more than 20 years in his castle in Scotland to develop logarithms, a calculation device. Napier's ideas on logarithms involved the form of one over E and the constant 10 to the seventh power. Algebra in the early 1600s was not fully developed, and Napier's logarithm of one did not equal zero. This made the calculations much less convenient than logarithms with a base of 10. Henry Briggs, a famous mathematician at Gresham College in London, read Napier's work in 1614, and the following year made the long journey to Edinburgh to meet Napier. Briggs showed up unannounced at Napier's castle door and suggested that John switch the base and form of his logarithms into something much simpler. They both agreed that a base of 10 with the log of one equal to zero would greatly simplify everyday calculations. Today we remember these as Briggs Common Logarithms. Until the development of electric calculating machines in the 20th century, any calculations involving multiplication, division, powers, and extraction of roots with large and small numbers were done using logarithms. The history of logarithms isn't just a lesson in math. There were many players responsible for successful navigation. Instrument makers, astronomers, mathematicians, and of course sailors. Creativity isn't only about going deep into one's field of work, it's about cross-pollination between disciplines too.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As you can imagine, 400 years ago, navigating the open ocean was difficult. The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course, and so sailors based their directions on the port they left, attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed. This process was known as dead reckoning, because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon. This was an easy mistake to make. Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible: sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily. All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land. John Bird, an instrument maker in London, made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day, called a sextant. Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time. Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship. Clocks came next. In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter, built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea. The timepiece that could maintain accurate time while on a pitching, yawing deck in harsh conditions was necessary in order to know the time back in England. There was one catch though: since such a timepiece was handmade, it was very expensive. So an alternate method using lunar measurements and intense calculations was often used to cut costs. The calculations to determine a ship's location for each measurement could take hours. But sextants and clocks weren't useful unless sailors could use these tools to determine their position. Fortunately, in the 1600s, an amateur mathematician had invented the missing piece. John Napier toiled for more than 20 years in his castle in Scotland to develop logarithms, a calculation device. Napier's ideas on logarithms involved the form of one over E and the constant 10 to the seventh power. Algebra in the early 1600s was not fully developed, and Napier's logarithm of one did not equal zero. This made the calculations much less convenient than logarithms with a base of 10. Henry Briggs, a famous mathematician at Gresham College in London, read Napier's work in 1614, and the following year made the long journey to Edinburgh to meet Napier. Briggs showed up unannounced at Napier's castle door and suggested that John switch the base and form of his logarithms into something much simpler. They both agreed that a base of 10 with the log of one equal to zero would greatly simplify everyday calculations. Today we remember these as Briggs Common Logarithms. Until the development of electric calculating machines in the 20th century, any calculations involving multiplication, division, powers, and extraction of roots with large and small numbers were done using logarithms. The history of logarithms isn't just a lesson in math. There were many players responsible for successful navigation. Instrument makers, astronomers, mathematicians, and of course sailors. Creativity isn't only about going deep into one's field of work, it's about cross-pollination between disciplines too.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every minute of every day, you breathe without even thinking about it. Your body does it on its own, from the day you're born until the day you die. You have muscles contract to bring oxygen, a gas, into your lungs, which is then transferred by your bloodstream to every cell in your body. Gases are strange. We can't see them, but we know they're there because we can feel them. What we experience as wind is really trillions and trillions of gas molecules slamming into your body. And it feels good, right? Science is based on observation. Unfortunately, we cannot observe gases with our eyes -- they're too small. We have to use our other senses to make observations and draw conclusions. Observations are then compiled, and we create a model. No, not that kind of model. A model is a way scientists describe the properties of physical phenomena. First, gases always move in a straight line. We don't really have anything to demonstrate this with because gravity always pulls objects down. So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line. That would be like a gas molecule. Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own. As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes. But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter. Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity. Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do -- remember, these are assumptions -- their energy remains constant. An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top. Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy, and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball and it flies away when that energy is transferred. The total energy stays the same. Gases work the same way. If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down. The total energy is constant. Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don't like to touch. But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide. Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy the gases have. The crazy thing is that at the same temperature, all gases have the same energy. It doesn't depend on the type of gas, just the temperature that gas is at. Keep in mind this is a model for the way gas particles behave, and based on our observations, gases always move in straight lines. They're so small, that they're not measurable on their own, and they don't interact with one another. But if they do bump into one another, that energy is transferred from one particle to another, and the total amount never changes. Temperature has a major effect, and in fact, all gases at the same temperature have the same average energy. Whew! I need to go catch my breath.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Observations are then compiled, and we create a model. No, not that kind of model. A model is a way scientists describe the properties of physical phenomena. First, gases always move in a straight line. We don't really have anything to demonstrate this with because gravity always pulls objects down. So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line. That would be like a gas molecule. Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own. As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes. But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter. Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity. Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do -- remember, these are assumptions -- their energy remains constant. An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top. Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy, and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball and it flies away when that energy is transferred. The total energy stays the same. Gases work the same way. If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down. The total energy is constant. Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don't like to touch. But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide. Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy the gases have. The crazy thing is that at the same temperature, all gases have the same energy. It doesn't depend on the type of gas, just the temperature that gas is at. Keep in mind this is a model for the way gas particles behave, and based on our observations, gases always move in straight lines. They're so small, that they're not measurable on their own, and they don't interact with one another. But if they do bump into one another, that energy is transferred from one particle to another, and the total amount never changes. Temperature has a major effect, and in fact, all gases at the same temperature have the same average energy. Whew! I need to go catch my breath.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In society, we have to follow laws that maintain order. Did you know all chemical matter follows certain laws as well? In fact, we can describe those laws by looking at relationships. Some easy laws to begin with are the ones that govern the gases. Back in 1662, Robert Boyle realized that gases had an interesting response when he put them into containers and changed their volume. Take an empty bottle and put the cap on it, closing that container. Now squeeze your bottle, and what happens? The pressure inside the bottle increases when the size of the container decreases. You can only crush that container so much until the gases inside push back on your hand. This is called an inverse proportion, and it changes at the same rate for every gas. Boyle's law allows chemists to predict the volume of any gas at any given pressure because the relationship is always the same. In 1780, Jacques Charles noticed a different relationship between gases and their temperature. If you've ever seen a hot-air balloon, you've seen this law in action. When the ballons are laid out, they're totally flat. Instead of blowing the balloon up like a party balloon, they use a giant flame to heat the air inside that envelope. As the air is heated up, the balloon begins to inflate as the gas volume increases. The hotter the gas becomes, the larger the volume, and that's Charles' law. Notice this law is different from Boyle's. Charles' law is a direct relationship. As the temperature increases, the volume increases as well. The third law is also easily demonstrated. When you're blowing up party balloons, the volume increases. As you are blowing, you're forcing more and more gas particles into the balloon from your lungs. This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action. As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased, the volume will increase as well. If you add too many particles, well, you know what happens next. Laws are everywhere, even in the tiniest particles of gas. If you squeeze them, the pressure will increase as the particles are pushed together. Low volume means a high pressure because those particles push back. As the temperature increases, gases move away from one another, and the volume increases as well. Finally, if you add gas to a closed container, that container's volume will expand. But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How does the pressure of a container change as the volume is changed?
Options: A. As volume increases, pressure increases as well. It is a direct proportion., B. As volume decreases, pressure decreases as well. It is a direct proportion., C. As volume increases, pressure decreases. It is an indirect proportion., D. As volume increases, pressure increases. It is a direct proportion.

This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action. As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased, the volume will increase as well. If you add too many particles, well, you know what happens next. Laws are everywhere, even in the tiniest particles of gas. If you squeeze them, the pressure will increase as the particles are pushed together. Low volume means a high pressure because those particles push back. As the temperature increases, gases move away from one another, and the volume increases as well. Finally, if you add gas to a closed container, that container's volume will expand. But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In society, we have to follow laws that maintain order. Did you know all chemical matter follows certain laws as well? In fact, we can describe those laws by looking at relationships. Some easy laws to begin with are the ones that govern the gases. Back in 1662, Robert Boyle realized that gases had an interesting response when he put them into containers and changed their volume. Take an empty bottle and put the cap on it, closing that container. Now squeeze your bottle, and what happens? The pressure inside the bottle increases when the size of the container decreases. You can only crush that container so much until the gases inside push back on your hand. This is called an inverse proportion, and it changes at the same rate for every gas. Boyle's law allows chemists to predict the volume of any gas at any given pressure because the relationship is always the same. In 1780, Jacques Charles noticed a different relationship between gases and their temperature. If you've ever seen a hot-air balloon, you've seen this law in action. When the ballons are laid out, they're totally flat. Instead of blowing the balloon up like a party balloon, they use a giant flame to heat the air inside that envelope. As the air is heated up, the balloon begins to inflate as the gas volume increases. The hotter the gas becomes, the larger the volume, and that's Charles' law. Notice this law is different from Boyle's. Charles' law is a direct relationship. As the temperature increases, the volume increases as well. The third law is also easily demonstrated. When you're blowing up party balloons, the volume increases. As you are blowing, you're forcing more and more gas particles into the balloon from your lungs. This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action. As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased, the volume will increase as well.

But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of the following explains why a hot air balloon inflates when it is heated?
Options: A. The increased temperature causes the gases to spread out and inflate the balloon., B. The flame forces more gas particles into the balloon, causing it to inflate., C. The balloon lets the cool air out through the bottom, where it is circulated by the flame., D. The flame lowers the gas pressure inside by heating up the air, causing it to inflate.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Optics, or the enhancement of our natural vision, has been one of the biggest catalysts for science over the past 500 years, Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest, but more practical matters that led to the initial advancements in optics, starting around 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press. In short order, books, which had been a rarity, were now becoming a widespread phenomenon. All that new reading material meant more knowledge was circulating, but it also meant that more people were straining their eyes, likely as they read by candlelight. And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286, the need for reading glasses increased substantially. Now that people could use lenses to see things more clearly, they started wondering if vision could be enhanced to see things the human eye couldn't perceive by its own devices. Robert Hooke pursued microscopy, and 1665 he published his findings of worlds inside worlds, which he called "cells" in the book "Micrographia." At the other end of the spectrum, Galileo innovated with telescopic lenses, and in 1609, he had refined a telescope until he had an instrument powerful enough to see distant objects in the sky with an accuracy no one had before him. He found that the moon had craters and mountains, that Jupiter had moons of its own, and the whole system governing the earth and space was brought into question. Not everyone was thrilled with all the things Galileo saw though. For instance, it was taught at the time that the moon was a perfectly smooth sphere. Yet here was visual proof that was awfully hard to discount. Upon finding moons around Jupiter, he also verified what Johannes Kepler had surmised: that the earth was not the center of the universe, dispelling another central dogma of Galileo's day. Then almost exactly a year after Galileo died, Isaac Newton was born. A lot that had been unknown was visible by now, but much of it was simply the foundation for further questions. What was light anyway? And color, for that matter? What were the laws that governed the earth, and the heavens? And could we capture them through keen observation? Newton experimented extensively with optics, and came to understand light as something of substance, and colors as components of light at different frequencies. Before Newton, people widely believed that the color was due to different amounts of light, with red being lots of light, and blue being mostly dark. Newton's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism, but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again, thus showing that color was a matter of light's refraction rather than how light or dark it was. Newton's studies of optics led to the development of the reflecting telescope. This, together with his study of planetary motion, led to his theory of gravitation, one of the world's greatest examples of learning to see something invisible by observing its effect on things that are visible. So fast forward a few hundred years, and here we stand. We've evolved from a single lens to optics that reveal the birth of a star in another galaxy, or a child developing in the womb, or an electron whirling around an atom. At a time when so much is visible, how we see the world around us matters even more than what we see. Will we see a world where everything important has already been discovered? Or will we see one in which yesterday's discoveries are but a doorway to the breakthroughs of tomorrow?

Newton's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism, but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again, thus showing that color was a matter of light's refraction rather than how light or dark it was. Newton's studies of optics led to the development of the reflecting telescope. This, together with his study of planetary motion, led to his theory of gravitation, one of the world's greatest examples of learning to see something invisible by observing its effect on things that are visible. So fast forward a few hundred years, and here we stand. We've evolved from a single lens to optics that reveal the birth of a star in another galaxy, or a child developing in the womb, or an electron whirling around an atom. At a time when so much is visible, how we see the world around us matters even more than what we see. Will we see a world where everything important has already been discovered? Or will we see one in which yesterday's discoveries are but a doorway to the breakthroughs of tomorrow?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Optics, or the enhancement of our natural vision, has been one of the biggest catalysts for science over the past 500 years, Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest, but more practical matters that led to the initial advancements in optics, starting around 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press. In short order, books, which had been a rarity, were now becoming a widespread phenomenon. All that new reading material meant more knowledge was circulating, but it also meant that more people were straining their eyes, likely as they read by candlelight. And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286, the need for reading glasses increased substantially. Now that people could use lenses to see things more clearly, they started wondering if vision could be enhanced to see things the human eye couldn't perceive by its own devices. Robert Hooke pursued microscopy, and 1665 he published his findings of worlds inside worlds, which he called "cells" in the book "Micrographia." At the other end of the spectrum, Galileo innovated with telescopic lenses, and in 1609, he had refined a telescope until he had an instrument powerful enough to see distant objects in the sky with an accuracy no one had before him. He found that the moon had craters and mountains, that Jupiter had moons of its own, and the whole system governing the earth and space was brought into question. Not everyone was thrilled with all the things Galileo saw though. For instance, it was taught at the time that the moon was a perfectly smooth sphere. Yet here was visual proof that was awfully hard to discount. Upon finding moons around Jupiter, he also verified what Johannes Kepler had surmised: that the earth was not the center of the universe, dispelling another central dogma of Galileo's day. Then almost exactly a year after Galileo died, Isaac Newton was born. A lot that had been unknown was visible by now, but much of it was simply the foundation for further questions. What was light anyway? And color, for that matter? What were the laws that governed the earth, and the heavens? And could we capture them through keen observation? Newton experimented extensively with optics, and came to understand light as something of substance, and colors as components of light at different frequencies.

Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We take a breath every few seconds. Our life depends upon inhaling oxygen, but we never think about how we breathe. It just seems to happen automatically. How can something that seems so simple be the key to keeping us alive? Breathing starts with the environment around us. The air we breathe in, or inspire, has a mixture of gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, which is the most important for our survival. It enters our body through the nose and mouth, moves down into the pharynx, trachea and bronchial tubes, and ultimately reaches the alveoli air sacs in the lungs. The alveoli use pressure to move oxygen and nutrients into the blood. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are a pumping system that facilitates this air exchange. How you breathe affects your energy level, especially when you are under physical or emotional stress. Think back to the last difficult test you had to take. It's likely that as you became more nervous, the tension in your body increased, and your breathing quickly sped up. The shallower our breath, the less oxygen that reaches our brain, and the harder it is to focus. What's our response to physical stress, like a fast-paced game of field hockey after school? As we exert pressure on our bodies, the muscles require a great deal of energy and demand additional oxygen. Our panting breath starts to kick in, which creates pressure to draw in more air and oxygen to the body, and regulates body temperature by allowing it to cool down naturally. These aren't the only times our breathing is affected or altered. Think about the last time you got angry or emotional. Anger creates a metabolic reaction in the body, which stresses it out and heats up our internal temperature. Have you ever seen anyone lose their cool? Ultimately, if we're breathing under stress over long periods of time, there are consequences. When the cells of a body aren't getting the oxygen they need, the nutrients available to the body decrease and toxins build up in the blood. It is thought that a hypoxic, or oxygen-poor environment, can increase cancerous cells. The good news is that we can control our breath much more than we realize. This means we can increase both the quality and quantity of the breath. The science of breathing has been around for thousands of years, from ancient yogis in India to respiratory therapists working with patients today. Both would tell you that there are specific techniques that will help you improve your breathing. Breathing is all about moving air from a higher-pressure to a lower-pressure environment. More breath means more oxygen, and ultimately a greater amount of nutrients that's available for our cells and blood. We naturally do this when we let out a big sigh. Changing the air pressure going into the lungs is one of the main ways to alter breathing. Our body automatically does this when we cough, sneeze, or have the hiccups. Here's a simple experiment. Close off your right nostril with your right thumb. Breathe in and out just through the left nostril. Notice how much harder it is to get the breath in. You have to focus your attention, and use your diaphragm and muscles much more than normal. By decreasing the surface area of the airways, you're increasing the pressure of oxygen moving from the alveoli to the blood. Yogis often practice alternate nostril breathing to slow down the breath, increase oxygen, and activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which deals with the body's operations when it's at rest. Let's try another exercise. Visualize the way a dog pants when it breathes. Now try doing the same type of panting, first with your tongue out, then with your mouth closed. You will find yourself using your stomach muscles to push the air out as you exhale. Place your hand under your nose, and you'll feel the strength of the breath coming out. Breathing this way is hard because it requires an active movement of our diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Our body temperature changes quickly during this exercise from the amount of pressure we are exerting on our breath. It's no surprise that you'll find dogs doing this breath often to cool down on a hot day. When we sleep at night, the medulla center of the brain makes sure that we keep breathing. Lucky for us we don't have to think about it. During the day, our breath is much more vulnerable, especially under stressful or difficult situations. That's why it's helpful to pay attention to your breathing. If you can monitor and change your breath, you can improve both the quality and quantity of oxygen that enters your body. This lowers stress, increases energy, and strengthens your immune system. So the next time someone tells you to relax and take a deep breath, you'll know exactly why.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We take a breath every few seconds. Our life depends upon inhaling oxygen, but we never think about how we breathe. It just seems to happen automatically. How can something that seems so simple be the key to keeping us alive? Breathing starts with the environment around us. The air we breathe in, or inspire, has a mixture of gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, which is the most important for our survival. It enters our body through the nose and mouth, moves down into the pharynx, trachea and bronchial tubes, and ultimately reaches the alveoli air sacs in the lungs. The alveoli use pressure to move oxygen and nutrients into the blood. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are a pumping system that facilitates this air exchange. How you breathe affects your energy level, especially when you are under physical or emotional stress. Think back to the last difficult test you had to take. It's likely that as you became more nervous, the tension in your body increased, and your breathing quickly sped up. The shallower our breath, the less oxygen that reaches our brain, and the harder it is to focus. What's our response to physical stress, like a fast-paced game of field hockey after school? As we exert pressure on our bodies, the muscles require a great deal of energy and demand additional oxygen. Our panting breath starts to kick in, which creates pressure to draw in more air and oxygen to the body, and regulates body temperature by allowing it to cool down naturally. These aren't the only times our breathing is affected or altered. Think about the last time you got angry or emotional. Anger creates a metabolic reaction in the body, which stresses it out and heats up our internal temperature. Have you ever seen anyone lose their cool? Ultimately, if we're breathing under stress over long periods of time, there are consequences. When the cells of a body aren't getting the oxygen they need, the nutrients available to the body decrease and toxins build up in the blood. It is thought that a hypoxic, or oxygen-poor environment, can increase cancerous cells. The good news is that we can control our breath much more than we realize. This means we can increase both the quality and quantity of the breath. The science of breathing has been around for thousands of years, from ancient yogis in India to respiratory therapists working with patients today. Both would tell you that there are specific techniques that will help you improve your breathing. Breathing is all about moving air from a higher-pressure to a lower-pressure environment. More breath means more oxygen, and ultimately a greater amount of nutrients that's available for our cells and blood. We naturally do this when we let out a big sigh. Changing the air pressure going into the lungs is one of the main ways to alter breathing. Our body automatically does this when we cough, sneeze, or have the hiccups. Here's a simple experiment. Close off your right nostril with your right thumb. Breathe in and out just through the left nostril. Notice how much harder it is to get the breath in. You have to focus your attention, and use your diaphragm and muscles much more than normal. By decreasing the surface area of the airways, you're increasing the pressure of oxygen moving from the alveoli to the blood. Yogis often practice alternate nostril breathing to slow down the breath, increase oxygen, and activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which deals with the body's operations when it's at rest. Let's try another exercise. Visualize the way a dog pants when it breathes. Now try doing the same type of panting, first with your tongue out, then with your mouth closed. You will find yourself using your stomach muscles to push the air out as you exhale. Place your hand under your nose, and you'll feel the strength of the breath coming out. Breathing this way is hard because it requires an active movement of our diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Our body temperature changes quickly during this exercise from the amount of pressure we are exerting on our breath. It's no surprise that you'll find dogs doing this breath often to cool down on a hot day. When we sleep at night, the medulla center of the brain makes sure that we keep breathing. Lucky for us we don't have to think about it. During the day, our breath is much more vulnerable, especially under stressful or difficult situations. That's why it's helpful to pay attention to your breathing. If you can monitor and change your breath, you can improve both the quality and quantity of oxygen that enters your body. This lowers stress, increases energy, and strengthens your immune system. So the next time someone tells you to relax and take a deep breath, you'll know exactly why.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Geckos and grasshoppers, worms and watermelons, elephants and Escherichia Coli, man and mushroom. All so different in form and function, but amazingly the same in how their form and function are determined. First, all these organisms are made of one or more cells, and every cell of every living thing on earth contains all the information it takes to create and duplicate and make variations of itself. That information is stored in a very long but quite simple double molecule called DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic Acid. And the DNA of every living organism is made of chains of four smaller molecules called nucleotides. What dictates the difference between a man and a mushroom is the sequence of these nucleotides in the long DNA chain. The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases, are made of a few carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus atoms, and the molecules look like this. And each of these four bases is attached to an identical backbone molecule, a sugar called deoxyribose - the "D" in DNA - and a phosphate group. Let's simplify these nucleotides and show them like this. So, a single sequence of nucleotides joined by their common sugars would look like this. And the DNA molecule where such sequences are stored looks like this. But how does a simple molecule dictate the form and function of millions of different living things? You can think of DNA as a great library of information, information that is used to do one thing and one thing only: direct the building of different protein molecules. And it's the proteins that build the cells and keep them functioning and changing and reproducing. Here's where the familiar word 'gene' comes in. If your DNA is a library of information, a gene is a book in that library. A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule. Let's say your body needs a particular protein, like insulin. To get it, some of your cells send a protein signal through the bloodstream to the cells in your pancreas, where insulin is made. That signal protein tells other proteins in the cell's nuclei to open up a part of the DNA double helix, the insulin gene, and start making insulin proteins. As soon as enough insulin has been produced, another signal protein comes to the pancreas' cells that tells them to stop making insulin. It's like looking up a book in the DNA library about insulin, and then putting it back when you're done. There are genes in DNA for visible and invisible things that make up your body, like genes for eye color, protein pigments, for skin color, for hair color, for stopping and starting bone growth, for your blood type, for how many fingers or arms and legs you have, for proteins that influence how long you live. Your DNA probably contains between 25 thousand and 40 thousand genes, while the DNA of a worm or a plant or a fruit fly contains about 12 thousand to 20 thousand genes. Some of those genes have quite different sequences of nucleotides than yours, and some are similar to yours. Though it happens infrequently, our own nucleotide sequences can change as the result of spontaneous or environmental damage which might remove or shift a nucleotide position. This changes the gene involved, and can then change the protein. Most of these changes, called mutations, have very little effect on the organism or its descendants. some are mildly damaging, and a few can make the organism better-suited to its environment. It is these tiny changes in DNA gene sequences, happening over millions of years, that create the differences among living organisms, from geckos to grasshoppers. worms to watermelons, elephants to Escherichia Coli, and man to mushroom.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Geckos and grasshoppers, worms and watermelons, elephants and Escherichia Coli, man and mushroom. All so different in form and function, but amazingly the same in how their form and function are determined. First, all these organisms are made of one or more cells, and every cell of every living thing on earth contains all the information it takes to create and duplicate and make variations of itself. That information is stored in a very long but quite simple double molecule called DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic Acid. And the DNA of every living organism is made of chains of four smaller molecules called nucleotides. What dictates the difference between a man and a mushroom is the sequence of these nucleotides in the long DNA chain. The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases, are made of a few carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus atoms, and the molecules look like this. And each of these four bases is attached to an identical backbone molecule, a sugar called deoxyribose - the "D" in DNA - and a phosphate group. Let's simplify these nucleotides and show them like this. So, a single sequence of nucleotides joined by their common sugars would look like this. And the DNA molecule where such sequences are stored looks like this. But how does a simple molecule dictate the form and function of millions of different living things? You can think of DNA as a great library of information, information that is used to do one thing and one thing only: direct the building of different protein molecules. And it's the proteins that build the cells and keep them functioning and changing and reproducing. Here's where the familiar word 'gene' comes in. If your DNA is a library of information, a gene is a book in that library. A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule. Let's say your body needs a particular protein, like insulin. To get it, some of your cells send a protein signal through the bloodstream to the cells in your pancreas, where insulin is made. That signal protein tells other proteins in the cell's nuclei to open up a part of the DNA double helix, the insulin gene, and start making insulin proteins. As soon as enough insulin has been produced, another signal protein comes to the pancreas' cells that tells them to stop making insulin.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the main greenhouse gas in climate change. So how does CO2 get into our atmosphere? Well, carbon is part of a cycle. It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth's surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the main greenhouse gas in climate change. So how does CO2 get into our atmosphere? Well, carbon is part of a cycle. It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth's surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth. When this happens, they're compressed under tons of pressure, and turned into carbon-based fossil fuels like oil, coal or natural gas. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been pulling those fossil fuels out of the ground and burning them, activating the stored energy to make electricity and power engines. But the thing is it also releases millions of years worth of stored CO2 back into the air. In addition, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2. But plants do the opposite. Trees suck up huge amounts of CO2, which balances the cycle. Thus, deforestation reduces the plants that store CO2. We're attacking the cycle from both sides. Think of it like a computer.

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why are gas stations always built
right next to other gas stations? Why can I drive for a mile
without finding a coffee shop and then stumble
across three on the same corner? Why do grocery stores,
auto repair shops and restaurants always seem to exist in groups instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community? While there are several factors that might go into deciding
where to place your business, clusters of similar companies can
be explained by a very simple story called Hotelling's Model
of Spatial Competition. Imagine that you sell
ice cream at the beach. Your beach is one mile long
and you have no competition. Where would you place your cart
in order to sell the most product? In the middle. The one-half-mile walk may
be too far for some people at each end of the beach, but your cart serves
as many people as possible. One day you show up at work just as your cousin Teddy
is arriving at the beach with his own ice cream cart. In fact, he's selling exactly the same type
of ice cream as you are. You agree that you will split
the beach in half. In order to ensure that customers
don't have to walk too far you set up your cart a quarter mile
south of the beach center, right in the middle of your territory. Teddy sets up a quarter mile
north of the center, in the middle of Teddy territory. With this agreement, everyone south
of you buys ice cream from you. Everyone north of Teddy buys from him,
and the 50% of beachgoers in between walk to the closest cart. No one walks
more than a quarter of a mile, and both vendors sell
to half of the beachgoers. Game theorists consider
this a socially optimal solution. It minimizes the maximum number
of steps any visitor must take in order to reach an ice cream cart. The next day, when you arrive at work, Teddy has set up his cart
in the middle of the beach. You return to your location
a quarter mile south of center and get the 25% of customers
to the south of you. Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory, but now you split the 25% of people
in between the two carts. Day three of the ice cream wars,
you get to the beach early, and set up right in the center
of Teddy territory, assuming you'll serve
the 75% of beachgoers to your south, leaving your cousin to sell
to the 25% of customers to the north. When Teddy arrives,
he sets up just south of you stealing all of the southerly customers, and leaving you with a small group
of people to the north. Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces
south of Teddy to regain your customers. When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you, and again, steals back all the customers
to the far end of the beach. Throughout the course of the day, both of you continue
to periodically move south towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers, until both of you eventually end up
at the center of the beach, back to back, each serving 50%
of the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers. At this point, you
and your competitive cousin have reached what game theorists
call a Nash Equilibrium - the point where neither of you
can improve your position by deviating from your current strategy. Your original strategy, where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach, didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium. Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream. With both of you now
in the center of the beach, you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers without making your current
customers worse off. However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution, since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat. Think about all the fast food chains, clothing boutiques,
or mobile phone kiosks at the mall. Customers may be better served by distributing services
throughout a community, but this leaves businesses vulnerable
to aggressive competition. In the real world, customers come
from more than one direction, and businesses are free to compete
with marketing strategies, by differentiating their product line,
and with price cuts, but at the heart of their strategy, companies like to keep their competition
as close as possible.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why are gas stations always built
right next to other gas stations? Why can I drive for a mile
without finding a coffee shop and then stumble
across three on the same corner? Why do grocery stores,
auto repair shops and restaurants always seem to exist in groups instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community? While there are several factors that might go into deciding
where to place your business, clusters of similar companies can
be explained by a very simple story called Hotelling's Model
of Spatial Competition. Imagine that you sell
ice cream at the beach. Your beach is one mile long
and you have no competition. Where would you place your cart
in order to sell the most product? In the middle. The one-half-mile walk may
be too far for some people at each end of the beach, but your cart serves
as many people as possible. One day you show up at work just as your cousin Teddy
is arriving at the beach with his own ice cream cart. In fact, he's selling exactly the same type
of ice cream as you are. You agree that you will split
the beach in half. In order to ensure that customers

to the south of you. Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory, but now you split the 25% of people
in between the two carts. Day three of the ice cream wars,
you get to the beach early, and set up right in the center
of Teddy territory, assuming you'll serve
the 75% of beachgoers to your south, leaving your cousin to sell
to the 25% of customers to the north. When Teddy arrives,
he sets up just south of you stealing all of the southerly customers, and leaving you with a small group
of people to the north. Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces
south of Teddy to regain your customers. When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you, and again, steals back all the customers
to the far end of the beach. Throughout the course of the day, both of you continue
to periodically move south towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers, until both of you eventually end up
at the center of the beach, back to back, each serving 50%
of the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers. At this point, you
and your competitive cousin have reached what game theorists
call a Nash Equilibrium - the point where neither of you
can improve your position by deviating from your current strategy. Your original strategy, where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach, didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium. Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream. With both of you now
in the center of the beach, you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers without making your current
customers worse off. However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution, since customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat. Think about all the fast food chains, clothing boutiques,
or mobile phone kiosks at the mall. Customers may be better served by distributing services
throughout a community, but this leaves businesses vulnerable
to aggressive competition. In the real world, customers come
from more than one direction, and businesses are free to compete
with marketing strategies, by differentiating their product line,
and with price cuts, but at the heart of their strategy, companies like to keep their competition
as close as possible.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How does a Nash Equilibrium affect consumers?
Options: A. It makes some customers travel farther than necessary to purchase product., B. It eliminates the possibility of a socially optimal solution., C. It enables customers the ability to compare the products (price, variety, etc.) with ease., D. All of the above
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why is the final outcome of the ice cream vendors' competitive behavior not socially optimal?
Options: A. Because customers at either end of the beach have to walk further than necessary to get ice cream., B. Because both vendors end up with fewer customers than they had initially., C. Because one vendor ends up with all of the customers., D. Because both vendors end up back at the center of the beach.
Correct Option: None

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 11, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 6
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Think about how your favorite stories hook you. "When he was nearly 13, my brother Jim got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jim's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self conscious about his injury." "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his." "My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than 'Pip.' So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip." Imagery, intrigue, emotion: each introduction makes you want to read more. If you have an assignment to write a literary analysis, your introduction will be just as important. There will be four elements in your essay: your introduction, thesis statement, analysis and conclusion. If you begin writing a literary analysis with the introduction, you may be discouraged. Here's a tip for writing a great introduction: Write it last, and write your thesis first. Figure out what you want to analyze before you actually analyze it. Your thesis is the foundation for the rest of your essay, including your introduction. So how do you find your thesis? Start by asking questions. To Charles Dickens you may ask, "why do you draw attention to characters' hands?" "What's up with their names?" "Pumblechook? Really?" To narrow your concept for analysis, answer the questions yourself. "Estella ridicules Pip's hands, Jaggers constantly washes his hands, Pip insufferably burns his hands, Mrs. Joe brings Pip up by hand." Are there patterns in your answers? "Estella's comments smack of cruelty, while Jaggers' cleanses his immoral conscience. Pip finds a second chance, while Mrs. Joe abuses a child under the guise of love and dedication." What can you analyze with this pattern? "Hands symbolize social class inequities, and through Dickens' criticism, he exposes the dire need for reform in Victorian London. What you will do next, which is an entirely different lesson, is to draft and revise your analysis. Only after you write your analysis, return to your introduction. Like authors earlier, try to intrigue and inspire your reader. Avoid starting with famous quotations, dictionary definitions or rhetorical questions. Consider the historical context of your topic, or an anecdote or some larger idea or concept. Here's an example: "27 bones in the hand and wrist allow humans to concurrently create and destroy. Thousands of hands have been behind history's astounding creations. Hands represent a powerful symbol, one that was not lost on Charles Dickens. In Great Expectations, Dickens uses hands to symbolize social class inequities, and through his criticism, he exposes the dire need for social reform in Victorian London." Take time crafting and revising your thesis and introduction. Remember, if you are bored while writing, your reader will be bored while reading. By the way, did you notice the introduction to this lesson? It didn't start with "here's how to write a thesis and introduction." Would that have hooked you?

Your thesis is the foundation for the rest of your essay, including your introduction. So how do you find your thesis? Start by asking questions. To Charles Dickens you may ask, "why do you draw attention to characters' hands?" "What's up with their names?" "Pumblechook? Really?" To narrow your concept for analysis, answer the questions yourself. "Estella ridicules Pip's hands, Jaggers constantly washes his hands, Pip insufferably burns his hands, Mrs. Joe brings Pip up by hand." Are there patterns in your answers? "Estella's comments smack of cruelty, while Jaggers' cleanses his immoral conscience. Pip finds a second chance, while Mrs. Joe abuses a child under the guise of love and dedication." What can you analyze with this pattern? "Hands symbolize social class inequities, and through Dickens' criticism, he exposes the dire need for reform in Victorian London. What you will do next, which is an entirely different lesson, is to draft and revise your analysis. Only after you write your analysis, return to your introduction. Like authors earlier, try to intrigue and inspire your reader. Avoid starting with famous quotations, dictionary definitions or rhetorical questions. Consider the historical context of your topic, or an anecdote or some larger idea or concept. Here's an example: "27 bones in the hand and wrist allow humans to concurrently create and destroy. Thousands of hands have been behind history's astounding creations. Hands represent a powerful symbol, one that was not lost on Charles Dickens. In Great Expectations, Dickens uses hands to symbolize social class inequities, and through his criticism, he exposes the dire need for social reform in Victorian London." Take time crafting and revising your thesis and introduction. Remember, if you are bored while writing, your reader will be bored while reading. By the way, did you notice the introduction to this lesson? It didn't start with "here's how to write a thesis and introduction." Would that have hooked you?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Circus music) [Ted N' Ed's Carnival] [John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible] [Adapted from a TEDTalk
given by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker
has spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, "What is invisible?" There's more of it
than you think, actually. Everything, I would say --
everything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears. In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic
substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. One of the interesting things
about invisibility is, the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand. It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds, when we can touch each other,
taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion which some claim
is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works. Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see
is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,
it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,
but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,
the less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient
for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,
except in your memory. One of the interesting
things about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, "Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two? And I said, "Yes." He said, "Why can't I?" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body remains from what was there
seven years ago. The question is:
who then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller
than the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word
called "blas," meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading
honey, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves
because they radiated. Somebody said to him,
"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?" And he said, "Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything." And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:
"What's another thing we can't see?" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions
really worth asking. "Why are we here?", and "What should
we do about it while we are?" To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, "I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves." (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here
on Earth to help others. What the others
are here for, I've no idea." (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music)

but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,
the less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient
for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,
except in your memory. One of the interesting
things about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, "Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two? And I said, "Yes." He said, "Why can't I?" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body remains from what was there
seven years ago. The question is:
who then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller
than the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word
called "blas," meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading
honey, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves
because they radiated. Somebody said to him,
"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?" And he said, "Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything." And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:
"What's another thing we can't see?" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions
really worth asking. "Why are we here?", and "What should
we do about it while we are?" To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, "I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves." (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here
on Earth to help others. What the others
are here for, I've no idea." (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music)

Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Circus music) [Ted N' Ed's Carnival] [John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible] [Adapted from a TEDTalk
given by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker
has spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, "What is invisible?" There's more of it
than you think, actually. Everything, I would say --
everything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears. In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic
substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. One of the interesting things
about invisibility is, the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand. It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds, when we can touch each other,
taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion which some claim
is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works. Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see
is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,
it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,
but they are very strange. The stars by day, I always

**Transcript**:
You've probably seen
an email or an internet post about how weird and random
English spelling seems to be. But what if I told you that it
actually makes perfect sense? In fact, that's spelling's job: Making sense. Think of spelling a word as peeling back the layers of an onion. The first layer
is a word's sense and meaning. Often there are multiple
layers of meaning. Another layer is the word's structure. Think of the center of the onion
as a word's base element, its essential kernel of meaning. A free-base element, like O-N-E, or T-W-O, can stand on its own as a word, like one, or two. A bound base, like the R-U-P-T
of "erupt" or "rupture" needs another element in order
to surface in a word. Two or more bases give us compounds, like "twofold"
or "someone" or "bankrupt." Once we figure
out a word's meaningful elements, We can peel back its history
to shed a little more light on why it's spelled as it is. The word "two," for example, needs its "W" in order
to mark its connection to words like "twice," "twelve," "twenty," "twin" and "between." A word's history
is another layer of the onion. With that understanding,
let's investigate the word "one." First we need to check
in with what it means. Unique, single, solitary. "One's" historical layers
include its relatives "only," "once," "eleven," and even "a," "an" and "any." But it's the morphological relatives - the ones that share the base O-N-E - That are really astonishing. There are the familiar
ones, like "anyone," and "one-track" and "oneself"
- those are obvious. But let's take a look
at some unexpected derivations of the word "one." The word "alone" is built from the prefix
A-L plus the base O-N-E. It's the same A-L prefix that we see in "always," "already,"
"almighty" and "almost." It means "all." the word "alone" means "all one." It was misanalysed in the middle ages as having the prefix "a," like in "asleep"
and "awake" and "around," and a new base was born: L-O-N-E, which then developed into its own family. In the word "atone," we find
the familiar preposition "at" compounded with the base O-N-E. See, when we atone for something
we've done wrong, we attempt to make things whole again, to fix what's broken, to be
at one again with whomever we hurt. But here's perhaps the best one of all: the word "onion," which is also
frequently derided as irregular or crazy, for its spelling
of "uh" with an O. But again, if we look
into the word's structure, and its history, it's a mystery no more. When we look at the roots of an onion, we learn that it is written
as O-N-E plus I-O-N, the same suffix we find
in "tension," "action," "union" and thousands of other words in English. Unlike the many cloves
in a head of garlic, an onion has a single bulb. It is marked by the state
or condition of oneness. Like an onion, English is one - one single writing system
shared across time and space. Its structure and its
history have many layers, and peeling them apart can really
add flavor to our language and spice up our understanding. See,
spelling is never just about spelling, but about how written words make sense. It's almost enough to make
you want to cry.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we talk, sometimes
we say things directly. "I'm going to the store,
I'll be back in five minutes." Other times though, we talk in a way
that conjures up a small scene. "It's raining cats and dogs out," we say, or "I was waiting
for the other shoe to drop." Metaphors are a way
to talk about one thing by describing something else. That may seem roundabout, but it's not. Seeing and hearing and tasting
are how we know anything first. The philosopher William James
described the world of newborn infants as a "buzzing and blooming confusion." Abstract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees and blossoms. Metaphors think
with the imagination and the senses. The hot chili peppers in them
explode in the mouth and the mind. They're also precise. We don't really stop
to think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog, but as soon as I do, I realize that I'm quite certain
the dog has to be a small one -- a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund -- and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland. I think a beagle might be about right. A metaphor isn't true or untrue
in any ordinary sense. Metaphors are art, not science, but they can still feel right or wrong. A metaphor that isn't good
leaves you confused. You know what it means
to feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like
to be tired as a whale. There's a paradox to metaphors. They almost always
say things that aren't true. If you say, "there's
an elephant in the room," there isn't an actual one, looking for the peanut dish on the table. Metaphors get under your skin
by ghosting right past the logical mind. Plus, we're used to thinking in images. Every night we dream impossible things. And when we wake up,
that way of thinking's still in us. We take off our dream shoes, and button ourselves into our lives. Some metaphors
include the words "like" or "as." "Sweet as honey," "strong as a tree." Those are called similes. A simile is a metaphor
that admits it's making a comparison. Similes tend to make you think. Metaphors let you feel things directly. Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor, "All the world's a stage." "The world is like a stage"
just seems thinner, and more boring. Metaphors can also live in verbs. Emily Dickinson begins a poem, "I saw no way --
the heavens were stitched --" and we know instantly what it would feel like
if the sky were a fabric sewn shut. They can live in adjectives, too. "Still waters run deep,"
we say of someone quiet and thoughtful. And the deep matters
as much as the stillness and the water do. One of the clearest places
to find good metaphors is in poems. Take this haiku by the 18th-century
Japanese poet Issa. "On a branch floating downriver,
a cricket singing." The first way to meet a metaphor
is just to see the world through its eyes: an insect sings from a branch
passing by in the middle of the river. Even as you see that though, some part of you recognizes in the image a small portrait of what it's like
to live in this world of change and time, our human fate is to vanish,
as surely as that small cricket will, and still, we do what it does. We live, we sing. Sometimes a poem
takes a metaphor and extends it, building on one idea in many ways. Here's the beginning
of Langston Hughes' famous poem "Mother to Son." "Well, son, I'll tell you. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor." Langston Hughes is making
a metaphor that compares a hard life to a wrecked house
you still have to live in. Those splinters and tacks feel real, they hurt your own feet
and your own heart, but the mother
is describing her life here, not her actual house. And hunger, and cold,
exhausting work and poverty are what's also inside those splinters. Metaphors aren't always
about our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches, and then moves on." The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door
of what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world
that only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world.

about our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches, and then moves on." The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door
of what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world
that only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world.

**Transcript**:
Translator: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we talk, sometimes
we say things directly. "I'm going to the store,
I'll be back in five minutes." Other times though, we talk in a way
that conjures up a small scene. "It's raining cats and dogs out," we say, or "I was waiting
for the other shoe to drop." Metaphors are a way
to talk about one thing by describing something else. That may seem roundabout, but it's not. Seeing and hearing and tasting
are how we know anything first. The philosopher William James
described the world of newborn infants as a "buzzing and blooming confusion." Abstract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees and blossoms. Metaphors think
with the imagination and the senses. The hot chili peppers in them
explode in the mouth and the mind. They're also precise. We don't really stop
to think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog, but as soon as I do, I realize that I'm quite certain
the dog has to be a small one -- a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund -- and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland. I think a beagle might be about right. A metaphor isn't true or untrue
in any ordinary sense. Metaphors are art, not science, but they can still feel right or wrong. A metaphor that isn't good
leaves you confused. You know what it means
to feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like
to be tired as a whale. There's a paradox to metaphors. They almost always
say things that aren't true. If you say, "there's
an elephant in the room," there isn't an actual one, looking for the peanut dish on the table. Metaphors get under your skin
by ghosting right past the logical mind. Plus, we're used to thinking in images. Every night we dream impossible things. And when we wake up,
that way of thinking's still in us. We take off our dream shoes, and button ourselves into our lives. Some metaphors
include the words "like" or "as." "Sweet as honey," "strong as a tree." Those are called similes. A simile is a metaphor
that admits it's making a comparison. Similes tend to make you think. Metaphors let you feel things directly. Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor, "All the world's a stage." "The world is like a stage"
just seems thinner, and more boring. Metaphors can also live in verbs. Emily Dickinson begins a poem, "I saw no way --
the heavens were stitched --" and we know instantly what it would feel like
if the sky were a fabric sewn shut. They can live in adjectives, too. "Still waters run deep,"
we say of someone quiet and thoughtful. And the deep matters
as much as the stillness and the water do. One of the clearest places
to find good metaphors is in poems. Take this haiku by the 18th-century
Japanese poet Issa. "On a branch floating downriver,
a cricket singing." The first way to meet a metaphor
is just to see the world through its eyes: an insect sings from a branch
passing by in the middle of the river. Even as you see that though, some part of you recognizes in the image a small portrait of what it's like
to live in this world of change and time, our human fate is to vanish,
as surely as that small cricket will, and still, we do what it does. We live, we sing. Sometimes a poem
takes a metaphor and extends it, building on one idea in many ways. Here's the beginning
of Langston Hughes' famous poem "Mother to Son." "Well, son, I'll tell you. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor." Langston Hughes is making
a metaphor that compares a hard life to a wrecked house
you still have to live in. Those splinters and tacks feel real, they hurt your own feet
and your own heart, but the mother
is describing her life here, not her actual house. And hunger, and cold,
exhausting work and poverty are what's also inside those splinters. Metaphors aren't always
about our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches, and then moves on." The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door
of what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world
that only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the early days of organic chemistry, chemists understood
that molecules were made of atoms connected through chemical bonds. However, the three-dimensional
shapes of molecules were utterly unclear, since they couldn't
be observed directly. Molecules were represented using
simple connectivity graphs like the one you see here. It was clear to savvy chemists
of the mid-19th century that these flat representations
couldn't explain many of their observations. But chemical theory hadn't provided
a satisfactory explanation for the three-dimensional
structures of molecules. In 1874, the chemist Van't Hoff
published a remarkable hypothesis: the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom point to the corners of a tetrahedron. It would take over 25 years for the quantum revolution
to theoretically validate his hypothesis. But Van't Hoff supported
his theory using optical rotation. Van't Hoff noticed that only compounds
containing a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups rotated plane-polarized light. Clearly there's something unique
about this class of compounds. Take a look at the two molecules
you see here. Each one is characterized
by a central, tetrahedral carbon atom bound to four different atoms: bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and hydrogen. We might be tempted to conclude
that the two molecules are the same, if we just concern
ourselves with what they're made of. However, let's see if we can
overlay the two molecules perfectly to really prove
that they're the same. We have free license to rotate
and translate both of the molecules as we wish. Remarkably though, no matter how we move the molecules, we find that perfect superposition
is impossible to achieve. Now take a look at your hands. Notice that your two hands
have all the same parts: a thumb, fingers, a palm, etc. Like our two molecules under study, both of your hands are made
of the same stuff. Furthermore, the distances between stuff
in both of your hands are the same. The index finger
is next to the middle finger, which is next to the ring finger, etc. The same is true
of our hypothetical molecules. All of their internal distances are the same. Despite
the similarities between them, your hands, and our molecules, are certainly not the same. Try superimposing
your hands on one another. Just like our molecules from before, you'll find that it can't
be done perfectly. Now, point your palms toward one another. Wiggle both of your index fingers. Notice that your left hand
looks as if it's looking in a mirror at your right. In other words, your hands
are mirror images. The same can be said of our molecules. We can turn them so
that one looks at the other as in a mirror. Your hands
- and our molecules - possess a spatial property
in common called chirality, or handedness. Chirality means exactly
what we've just described: a chiral object is not
the same as its mirror image. Chiral objects are very special
in both chemistry and everyday life. Screws, for example, are also chiral. That's why we need the terms
right-handed and left-handed screws. And believe it or not,
certain types of light can behave like chiral screws. Packed into every linear,
plane-polarized beam of light are right-handed and left-handed parts that rotate together
to produce plane polarization. Chiral molecules, placed
in a beam of such light, interact differently
with the two chiral components. As a result, one component of the light
gets temporarily slowed down relative to the other. The
effect on the light beam is a rotation of its plane
from the original one, otherwise known as optical rotation. Van't Hoff and later chemists
realized that the chiral nature of tetrahedral carbons can explain
this fascinating phenomenon. Chirality is responsible for all kinds
of other fascinating effects in chemistry, and everyday life. Humans tend to love symmetry and so if you look around you,
you'll find that chiral objects made by humans are rare. But chiral molecules
are absolutely everywhere. Phenomena as separate as optical rotation, Screwing together furniture, and clapping your hands all involve this intriguing
spatial property.

**Transcript**:
In the early days of organic chemistry, chemists understood
that molecules were made of atoms connected through chemical bonds. However, the three-dimensional
shapes of molecules were utterly unclear, since they couldn't
be observed directly. Molecules were represented using
simple connectivity graphs like the one you see here. It was clear to savvy chemists
of the mid-19th century that these flat representations
couldn't explain many of their observations. But chemical theory hadn't provided
a satisfactory explanation for the three-dimensional
structures of molecules. In 1874, the chemist Van't Hoff
published a remarkable hypothesis: the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom point to the corners of a tetrahedron. It would take over 25 years for the quantum revolution
to theoretically validate his hypothesis. But Van't Hoff supported
his theory using optical rotation. Van't Hoff noticed that only compounds
containing a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups rotated plane-polarized light. Clearly there's something unique
about this class of compounds. Take a look at the two molecules
you see here. Each one is characterized
by a central, tetrahedral carbon atom bound to four different atoms: bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and hydrogen. We might be tempted to conclude
that the two molecules are the same, if we just concern
ourselves with what they're made of. However, let's see if we can
overlay the two molecules perfectly to really prove
that they're the same. We have free license to rotate
and translate both of the molecules as we wish. Remarkably though, no matter how we move the molecules, we find that perfect superposition
is impossible to achieve. Now take a look at your hands. Notice that your two hands
have all the same parts: a thumb, fingers, a palm, etc. Like our two molecules under study, both of your hands are made
of the same stuff. Furthermore, the distances between stuff
in both of your hands are the same. The index finger
is next to the middle finger, which is next to the ring finger, etc. The same is true
of our hypothetical molecules. All of their internal distances are the same. Despite
the similarities between them, your hands, and our molecules, are certainly not the same. Try superimposing
your hands on one another. Just like our molecules from before, you'll find that it can't
be done perfectly. Now, point your palms toward one another. Wiggle both of your index fingers. Notice that your left hand
looks as if it's looking in a mirror at your right. In other words, your hands
are mirror images. The same can be said of our molecules. We can turn them so
that one looks at the other as in a mirror. Your hands
- and our molecules - possess a spatial property
in common called chirality, or handedness. Chirality means exactly
what we've just described: a chiral object is not
the same as its mirror image. Chiral objects are very special
in both chemistry and everyday life. Screws, for example, are also chiral. That's why we need the terms
right-handed and left-handed screws. And believe it or not,
certain types of light can behave like chiral screws. Packed into every linear,
plane-polarized beam of light are right-handed and left-handed parts that rotate together
to produce plane polarization. Chiral molecules, placed
in a beam of such light, interact differently
with the two chiral components. As a result, one component of the light
gets temporarily slowed down relative to the other. The
effect on the light beam is a rotation of its plane
from the original one, otherwise known as optical rotation. Van't Hoff and later chemists
realized that the chiral nature of tetrahedral carbons can explain
this fascinating phenomenon. Chirality is responsible for all kinds
of other fascinating effects in chemistry, and everyday life. Humans tend to love symmetry and so if you look around you,
you'll find that chiral objects made by humans are rare. But chiral molecules
are absolutely everywhere. Phenomena as separate as optical rotation, Screwing together furniture, and clapping your hands all involve this intriguing
spatial property.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed that it's harder 
to start pedaling your bicycle than it is to ride at a constant speed? Or wondered what causes your bicycle to move? Or thought about why it goes forward 
instead of backwards or sideways? Perhaps not, and you wouldn't be alone. It wasn't until the 17th century that Isaac Newton described 
the fundamental laws of motion and we understood the answer 
to these three questions. What Newton recognized was that 
things tend to keep on doing what they are already doing. 
So when your bicycle is stopped, it stays stopped, and when it is going, it stays going. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest. That's Newton's First Law. Physicists call it the Law of Inertia, 
which is a fancy way of saying that moving objects don't spontaneously 
speed up, slow down, or change direction. It is this inertia that you must overcome 
to get your bicycle moving. Now you know that you have to overcome 
inertia to get your bicycle moving, but what is it that allows you to overcome it? Well, the answer is explained by Newton's Second Law. In mathematical terms, Newton's Second Law says that force is the product of mass times acceleration. To cause an object to accelerate, or speed up, a force must be applied. The more force you apply, the quicker you accelerate. 
And the more mass your bicycle has, and the more mass you have too, the more force you have to use 
to accelerate at the same rate. This is why it would be really difficult 
to pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle. And it is this force, which is applied 
by your legs pushing down on the pedals, that allows you to overcome Newton's Law of Inertia. The harder you push down on the pedals, 
the bigger the force and the quicker you accelerate. Now on to the final question: When you do get your bike moving, why does it go forward? According to Newton's Third Law, 
for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. To understand this, think about what 
happens when you drop a bouncy ball. As the bouncy ball hits the floor, it causes a downward force on the floor. This is the action. The floor reacts by pushing 
on the ball with the same force, but in the opposite direction, upward, causing it to bounce back up to you. Together, the floor and the ball form what's called the action/reaction pair. 
When it comes to your bicycle, it is a little more complicated. 
As your bicycle wheels spin clockwise, the parts of each tire 
touching the ground push backwards against the Earth: the actions. The ground pushes 
forward with the same force against each of your tires: the reactions. Since you have two bicycle tires, 
each one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward.

forward with the same force against each of your tires: the reactions. Since you have two bicycle tires, 
each one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed that it's harder 
to start pedaling your bicycle than it is to ride at a constant speed? Or wondered what causes your bicycle to move? Or thought about why it goes forward 
instead of backwards or sideways? Perhaps not, and you wouldn't be alone. It wasn't until the 17th century that Isaac Newton described 
the fundamental laws of motion and we understood the answer 
to these three questions. What Newton recognized was that 
things tend to keep on doing what they are already doing. 
So when your bicycle is stopped, it stays stopped, and when it is going, it stays going. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest. That's Newton's First Law. Physicists call it the Law of Inertia, 
which is a fancy way of saying that moving objects don't spontaneously 
speed up, slow down, or change direction. It is this inertia that you must overcome 
to get your bicycle moving. Now you know that you have to overcome 
inertia to get your bicycle moving, but what is it that allows you to overcome it? Well, the answer is explained by Newton's Second Law. In mathematical terms, Newton's Second Law says that force is the product of mass times acceleration. To cause an object to accelerate, or speed up, a force must be applied. The more force you apply, the quicker you accelerate. 
And the more mass your bicycle has, and the more mass you have too, the more force you have to use 
to accelerate at the same rate. This is why it would be really difficult 
to pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle. And it is this force, which is applied 
by your legs pushing down on the pedals, that allows you to overcome Newton's Law of Inertia. The harder you push down on the pedals, 
the bigger the force and the quicker you accelerate. Now on to the final question: When you do get your bike moving, why does it go forward? According to Newton's Third Law, 
for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. To understand this, think about what 
happens when you drop a bouncy ball. As the bouncy ball hits the floor, it causes a downward force on the floor. This is the action. The floor reacts by pushing 
on the ball with the same force, but in the opposite direction, upward, causing it to bounce back up to you. Together, the floor and the ball form what's called the action/reaction pair. 
When it comes to your bicycle, it is a little more complicated. 
As your bicycle wheels spin clockwise, the parts of each tire 
touching the ground push backwards against the Earth: the actions. The ground pushes 
forward with the same force against each of your tires: the reactions. Since you have two bicycle tires, 
each one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since 
the Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle 
tires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward.

**Transcript**:
Today we're talking about weird materials that we use in space, in robots
and in your mouth. I'm talking about shape memory alloys. Like the name says, these are metals that remember different shapes. To understand how these metals work, we've got to talk about atoms and organizing. Let's talk about atoms first. Atoms are tiny bits of matter
that you cannot see with your eye yet they make up everything in our world, from the chair that you're sitting on
to your cell phone. Atoms have some surprising ways of behaving too. We'll talk about that shortly. Now, how big is an atom? Well, imagine pulling one of your hairs
out of your head and whittling it like a stick 100,000 times. One of those shavings 
would be the width of an atom. They're that small. Now let's talk about atoms and organizing. You may not know this,
but atoms arrange themselves similar to the way we humans arrange ourselves. Sometimes they sit in rows, like we do on a bus or an airplane. We call that seating arrangement a phase. Other times they sit diagonal from each other, sort of like seats in a movie theater or sports stadium. This is another phase. When atoms move from one seating to another this is called a phase change. Phase changes are all around us. You may already know about water's phases: solid, liquid and gas. Many other materials have phases like that too. Some of them have several solid phases. OK. Back to those shape memory alloys
we mentioned before. When we say that the metals 
remember their different shapes, what we're really saying is they
remember different seating arrangements of atoms. When the atoms rearrange, the metal moves from one shape to another. Let's look at a phase change in action. Here I have a metal wire that 
is made out of nickel and titanium. This metal wire is a shape memory alloy, and I'm going to make it switch
between its different shapes using heat from a lighter. Watch this. I'm going to wrap this wire around my finger and then heat it. Amazing! That wire returns to a straight line,
when I heat it. Let's try that again. I'm going to wrap it around my finger,
and heat it. Yep, that's still amazing. Not only is it amazing, this is weird, because metals generally don't do that. Here's a paper clip. When I heat it, I get nothing. What we're seeing is the shape memory wire
changing phases when it gets hot. When the wire is cold, atoms 
are in a diagonal arrangement, like the movie theater seating,
we talked about before. We call this a monoclinic arrangement, and scientists will call this phase martensite. When I heated up the wire, the atoms moved into columns like airplane seating. This is a cubic arrangement. Scientists will call this phase austenite. So when we added the heat, 
the atoms shifted positions seamlessly, and they'll do this forever. They have this coordinated motion, 
just like members of a tireless marching band. Each makes a small shift, but all 
together those small shifts create a totally different pattern. So that's pretty cool, but
where do we use these materials? Well, if you look in the sky tonight, shape memory alloys are at work - on Mars. They're used to move 
panels on the Mars rover, so that it can study the environment. Like our metal straightened when it was heated, the metals holding the panels
will move when electrically heated. When we stop heating the shape memory metal, the panel will return back,
due to an opposing spring. Back on Earth, shape memory alloys
are used to open up clogged arteries as stents, which are small collapsible springs that force open passages. Shape memory alloys are also used to move robots, toy butterflies, teeth in braces,
and for a perfect fit every time, shape memory wires are used 
as underwires in bras. Now you know Victoria's secret. By popping a bra into the dryer, 
it'll be brand new every time. So whether it's on Mars or in your mouth,
small atomic movements can create huge changes, and understanding the way atoms behave allows us to make materials 
that make our world a better place.

When atoms move from one seating to another this is called a phase change. Phase changes are all around us. You may already know about water's phases: solid, liquid and gas. Many other materials have phases like that too. Some of them have several solid phases. OK. Back to those shape memory alloys
we mentioned before. When we say that the metals 
remember their different shapes, what we're really saying is they
remember different seating arrangements of atoms. When the atoms rearrange, the metal moves from one shape to another. Let's look at a phase change in action. Here I have a metal wire that 
is made out of nickel and titanium. This metal wire is a shape memory alloy, and I'm going to make it switch
between its different shapes using heat from a lighter. Watch this. I'm going to wrap this wire around my finger and then heat it. Amazing! That wire returns to a straight line,
when I heat it. Let's try that again. I'm going to wrap it around my finger,
and heat it. Yep, that's still amazing. Not only is it amazing, this is weird, because metals generally don't do that. Here's a paper clip. When I heat it, I get nothing. What we're seeing is the shape memory wire
changing phases when it gets hot. When the wire is cold, atoms 
are in a diagonal arrangement, like the movie theater seating,
we talked about before. We call this a monoclinic arrangement, and scientists will call this phase martensite. When I heated up the wire, the atoms moved into columns like airplane seating. This is a cubic arrangement. Scientists will call this phase austenite. So when we added the heat, 
the atoms shifted positions seamlessly, and they'll do this forever. They have this coordinated motion, 
just like members of a tireless marching band. Each makes a small shift, but all 
together those small shifts create a totally different pattern. So that's pretty cool, but
where do we use these materials? Well, if you look in the sky tonight, shape memory alloys are at work - on Mars. They're used to move 
panels on the Mars rover, so that it can study the environment. Like our metal straightened when it was heated, the metals holding the panels
will move when electrically heated. When we stop heating the shape memory metal, the panel will return back,
due to an opposing spring. Back on Earth, shape memory alloys
are used to open up clogged arteries as stents, which are small collapsible springs that force open passages. Shape memory alloys are also used to move robots, toy butterflies, teeth in braces,
and for a perfect fit every time, shape memory wires are used 
as underwires in bras. Now you know Victoria's secret. By popping a bra into the dryer, 
it'll be brand new every time. So whether it's on Mars or in your mouth,
small atomic movements can create huge changes, and understanding the way atoms behave allows us to make materials 
that make our world a better place.

that you cannot see with your eye yet they make up everything in our world, from the chair that you're sitting on
to your cell phone. Atoms have some surprising ways of behaving too. We'll talk about that shortly. Now, how big is an atom? Well, imagine pulling one of your hairs
out of your head and whittling it like a stick 100,000 times. One of those shavings

Transcriber: Ido Dekkers
Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo So what is gravity? I bet most of you think it's: "What goes up, must come down!" Is that right? Well, sorta, but not really. Technically, the law of gravity is an equation. It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between them squared. That was easy, right? Probably not. What does this actually mean? Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else. What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects, they are attracted to each other. OK. Let's try and wrap our minds around this. What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff? It falls to the earth. Right? Well, yes, but something else happens. You see, the law of gravity says that both objects, the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other. This means that the rock falls towards the earth, and the earth falls towards the rock. Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses. The earth is much much much more massive than the rock, so it moves a very very small distance, and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther with respect to the earth. Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars. It turns out they will be attracted to each other. I'm not talking about that kind of attraction. See, they have mass, and since they have mass, they will move towards each other. They are attracted to each other. Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets? You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles? When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other, they move together. They are attracted to each other. And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction. Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets. Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same, they just behave in a similar way. Let's think of one other thing - astronauts. You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon than on the earth. Why is that? Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth. Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. It's like the moon is a weaker magnet. They aren't as attracted to each other. Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet. The pull of the magnets towards each other are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity. For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth. It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system. It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away, so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak, it is a long ways away. Therefore the attraction isn't as strong. So let's look back at that law of gravity. The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2. You see the force of gravity is equal to a number. That's that universal gravitational constant G times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two. Think of M1 being the mass of the sun and M2 being the mass of the earth. And then we divide by the distance between them squared. This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth. You could just as easily plug in your mass and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth, and find out how much you are attracted to the earth, and the earth attracted to you. So, what's gravity? Everything is attracted to everything else. Everything. Oh, one last thing, just to make you wonder. What causes gravity? Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other? Well, the answer is - We don't know. The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists. We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity. It is one of the great mysteries of science.

Transcriber: Ido Dekkers
Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo So what is gravity? I bet most of you think it's: "What goes up, must come down!" Is that right? Well, sorta, but not really. Technically, the law of gravity is an equation. It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between them squared. That was easy, right? Probably not. What does this actually mean? Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else. What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects, they are attracted to each other. OK. Let's try and wrap our minds around this. What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff? It falls to the earth. Right? Well, yes, but something else happens. You see, the law of gravity says that both objects, the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other. This means that the rock falls towards the earth, and the earth falls towards the rock. Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses. The earth is much much much more massive than the rock, so it moves a very very small distance, and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther with respect to the earth. Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars. It turns out they will be attracted to each other. I'm not talking about that kind of attraction. See, they have mass, and since they have mass, they will move towards each other. They are attracted to each other. Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets? You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles? When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other, they move together. They are attracted to each other. And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction. Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets. Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same, they just behave in a similar way. Let's think of one other thing - astronauts. You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon than on the earth. Why is that? Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth. Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. It's like the moon is a weaker magnet. They aren't as attracted to each other. Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet. The pull of the magnets towards each other are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity. For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth. It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system. It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away, so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak, it is a long ways away. Therefore the attraction isn't as strong. So let's look back at that law of gravity. The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2. You see the force of gravity is equal to a number. That's that universal gravitational constant G times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two. Think of M1 being the mass of the sun and M2 being the mass of the earth. And then we divide by the distance between them squared. This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth. You could just as easily plug in your mass and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth, and find out how much you are attracted to the earth, and the earth attracted to you. So, what's gravity? Everything is attracted to everything else. Everything. Oh, one last thing, just to make you wonder. What causes gravity? Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other? Well, the answer is - We don't know. The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists. We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity. It is one of the great mysteries of science.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You know, back in the '40s and '50s, the original standard television 
had a 4 to 3 width to height ratio. That shape was chosen 
to be a slight rectangle, but still mostly square, thus having 
the maximal screen area for the given dimensions. And that's still the ratio on many TVs 
and computer monitors in today's homes. The problem is, hardly anybody today 
treats video content in a 4 to 3 ratio. See, this whole problem started when people wanted 
to watch movies from the theater in the comfort of their own homes. Movie screens are considerably larger 
than our home television. More important, the screen 
is completely different rectangle and can't mathematically fit 
on our TV screens without manipulation. A typical TV is one and a third times
wider than it is tall Some movie screens could be up to 
three times as wide as it is tall. So what're we going to do to make it fit? 
Well, we have all kinds of options. Well, we could squeeze and stretch 
and mangle everything onto the screen, to make it all fill up, and everyone would look
ridiculously thin and compressed. The good news is
the sound would be just fine, although I don't think people would be 
too happy about that option, particularly the actors in the movie. We could just cut a chunk 
of the original movie like a cookie cutter and just see that frame of the movie. The problem with that would be 
people and objects would be speaking from off the screen,
or, even worse, they might be cut in half. Some movie editors use what's called
the "pan and scan" technique to allow the full height 
of the TV screen to be used, but pick and choose what section 
of the original movie should be shown on your screen thus eliminating the annoying 
cutting of people. Imagine that job: staring at a 4 to 3 hole watching movies all day, 
deciding for everyone which piece of the screen is
the most important part for people to see. Now let's do a little quick math. If we compare a major cinematic film 
produced on a 2.35 to 1 aspect frame with my standard 4 to 3 TV screen, we find out that only 55% of the movie 
can actually fit on the screen at any one time. Just over half! You've seen the disclaimer 
at the beginning of the movie on TV or DVD that says, 
"This film has been modified from its original format 
to fit on your TV screen." Well, what it should say is, "We are only displaying 55% 
of the movie of our choosing." Now for all the full-screen TV lovers, this is your dilemma: do you want to see all the movie, 
or is 55% good enough? How about new TVs? Around the start of the century, 
some widescreen TVs emerged in a 16 to 9, or 1.78 times 
wider than it is tall. Well, this screen fits 
the movie a little better, but still only shows 75% 
of the original movie at one time. Suppose someone made 
a TV for your living room that was actually 2.35 to 1 
to show those full movies? Well, the TV with the same height 
as the most current 50-inch TVs - that TV would be close to six feet long. And on top of that, you'd only use 
the full screen when you watched movies. Most of the other content 
would have to be stretched, or have empty space on 
the sides of the screen. Of course, there is one more option. We can just shrink
the movie screen proportionally, to fit the width of your home television. We can mathematically scale the original 
to fit exactly the width of the screen and this'll preserve 
the entire movie screen, but show the infamous black bars
along the top and bottom that so many television watchers abhor. Of course, now you can argue 
that we're only using 75% of that screen. And that is where the real question is: do you want your full screen, 
or do you want to see the entire movie? Most likely, you just need a bigger TV.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You know, back in the '40s and '50s, the original standard television 
had a 4 to 3 width to height ratio. That shape was chosen 
to be a slight rectangle, but still mostly square, thus having 
the maximal screen area for the given dimensions. And that's still the ratio on many TVs 
and computer monitors in today's homes. The problem is, hardly anybody today 
treats video content in a 4 to 3 ratio. See, this whole problem started when people wanted 
to watch movies from the theater in the comfort of their own homes. Movie screens are considerably larger 
than our home television. More important, the screen 
is completely different rectangle and can't mathematically fit 
on our TV screens without manipulation. A typical TV is one and a third times
wider than it is tall Some movie screens could be up to 
three times as wide as it is tall. So what're we going to do to make it fit? 
Well, we have all kinds of options. Well, we could squeeze and stretch 
and mangle everything onto the screen, to make it all fill up, and everyone would look
ridiculously thin and compressed. The good news is
the sound would be just fine, although I don't think people would be 
too happy about that option, particularly the actors in the movie. We could just cut a chunk 
of the original movie like a cookie cutter and just see that frame of the movie. The problem with that would be 
people and objects would be speaking from off the screen,
or, even worse, they might be cut in half. Some movie editors use what's called
the "pan and scan" technique to allow the full height 
of the TV screen to be used, but pick and choose what section 
of the original movie should be shown on your screen thus eliminating the annoying 
cutting of people. Imagine that job: staring at a 4 to 3 hole watching movies all day, 
deciding for everyone which piece of the screen is
the most important part for people to see. Now let's do a little quick math. If we compare a major cinematic film 
produced on a 2.35 to 1 aspect frame with my standard 4 to 3 TV screen, we find out that only 55% of the movie 
can actually fit on the screen at any one time. Just over half! You've seen the disclaimer 
at the beginning of the movie on TV or DVD that says, 
"This film has been modified from its original format 
to fit on your TV screen." Well, what it should say is, "We are only displaying 55% 
of the movie of our choosing." Now for all the full-screen TV lovers, this is your dilemma: do you want to see all the movie, 
or is 55% good enough? How about new TVs? Around the start of the century, 
some widescreen TVs emerged in a 16 to 9, or 1.78 times 
wider than it is tall. Well, this screen fits 
the movie a little better, but still only shows 75% 
of the original movie at one time. Suppose someone made 
a TV for your living room that was actually 2.35 to 1 
to show those full movies? Well, the TV with the same height 
as the most current 50-inch TVs - that TV would be close to six feet long. And on top of that, you'd only use 
the full screen when you watched movies. Most of the other content 
would have to be stretched, or have empty space on 
the sides of the screen. Of course, there is one more option. We can just shrink
the movie screen proportionally, to fit the width of your home television. We can mathematically scale the original 
to fit exactly the width of the screen and this'll preserve 
the entire movie screen, but show the infamous black bars
along the top and bottom that so many television watchers abhor. Of course, now you can argue 
that we're only using 75% of that screen. And that is where the real question is: do you want your full screen, 
or do you want to see the entire movie? Most likely, you just need a bigger TV.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When did it become a real problem to have a 4:3 width to height ratio?
Options: A. When televisions became thinner, B. When the sitcom became the predominant form of entertainment, C. When color televisions became more popular than black and white televisions, the aspect ratio had to change to meet the demands of more colors, D. When people wanted to watch movies from the theater in the comfort of home
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main problem with watching movies on a 4:3 TV screen?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

Whether you like it or not,
we use numbers every day. Some numbers, such as the speed of sound, are small and easy to work with. Other numbers, such as the speed of light, are much larger
and cumbersome to work with. We can use scientific notation
to express these large numbers in a much more manageable format. So we can write
299,792,458 meters per second as 3.0 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second. Correct scientific notation requires that the first term
range in value so that it is greater than one
but less than 10, and the second term represents
the power of 10 or order of magnitude by which we multiply the first term. We can use the power of 10 as a tool
in making quick estimations when we do not need or care
for the exact value of a number. For example, the diameter of an atom is approximately 10 to the power
of negative 12 meters. The height of a tree is approximately
10 to the power of one meter. The diameter of the Earth is approximately
10 to the power of seven meters. The ability to use the power of 10
as an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again, like when you're trying to guess
the number of M&M's in a jar, but is also an essential skill
in math and science, especially when dealing with
what are known as Fermi problems. Fermi problems are named
after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who's famous for making rapid
order-of-magnitude estimations, or rapid estimations,
with seemingly little available data. Fermi worked on the Manhattan Project
in developing the atomic bomb, and when it was tested
at the Trinity site in 1945, Fermi dropped a few pieces
of paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled
backwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion
as 10 kilotons of TNT, which is on the same order of magnitude
as the actual value of 20 kilotons. One example of the classic
Fermi estimation problems is to determine
how many piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago, Illinois. At first, there seem to be
so many unknowns that the problem appears to be unsolvable. That is the perfect application
for a power-of-10 estimation, as we don't need an exact answer - an estimation will work. We can start by determining how many
people live in the city of Chicago. We know that it is a large city, but we may be unsure about exactly
how many people live in the city. Are the one million people?
Five million people? This is the point in the problem where many people become frustrated
with the uncertainty, but we can easily get through this
by using the power of 10. We can estimate the magnitude
of the population of Chicago as 10 to the power of six. While this doesn't tell us exactly
how many people live there, it serves an accurate estimation
for the actual population of just under three million people. So if there are approximately
10 to the sixth people in Chicago, how many pianos are there? If we want to continue
dealing with orders of magnitude, we can either say that one out of 10 or one out of one hundred
people own a piano. Given that our estimate of the population
includes children and adults, we'll go with the latter estimate, which estimates that there are
approximately 10 to the fourth, or 10,000 pianos, in Chicago. With this many pianos,
how many piano tuners are there? We could begin the process of thinking
about how often the pianos are tuned, how many pianos are tuned in one day, or how many days a piano tuner works, but that's not the point
of rapid estimation. We instead think in orders of magnitude, and say that a piano tuner tunes roughly
10 to the second pianos in a given year, which is approximately
a few hundred pianos. Given our previous estimate
of 10 to the fourth pianos in Chicago, and the estimate that each piano tuner can
tune 10 to the second pianos each year, we can say that there are approximately
10 to the second piano tuners in Chicago. Now, I know what you must be thinking: How can all of these estimates
produce a reasonable answer? Well, it's rather simple. In any Fermi problem, it is assumed that the overestimates and underestimates
balance each other out, and produce an estimation that is usually within one order
of magnitude of the actual answer. In our case we can confirm this
by looking in the phone book for the number of piano tuners
listed in Chicago. What do we find? 81. Pretty incredible, given
our order-of-magnitude estimation. But, hey - that's the power of 10.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When you use Fermi Problems, you are depending on a large number of estimates to produce a reasonable answer. How is this possible?
Options: A. It's generally not. Fermi Problems are only meant to strengthen critical thinking skills, not to produce reliable answers., B. It is assumed that the underestimations and overestimations balance each other out and produce a reliable answer., C. If you always start with at least 100,000 more points of data than is necessary, Fermi Problems will yield much more reliable answers., D. Fermi Problems do not depend on estimations. They always consider exact numbers that are calculated very carefully.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the assumption made in any Fermi problem about the overestimates and underestimates?
Options: A. That they will cancel each other out and produce an exact answer., B. That they will balance each other out and produce an estimation that is usually within one order of magnitude of the actual answer., C. That they will always result in an overestimation of the actual answer., D. That they will always result in an underestimation of the actual answer.
Correct Option: None

**Transcript**:
Whether you like it or not,
we use numbers every day. Some numbers, such as the speed of sound, are small and easy to work with. Other numbers, such as the speed of light, are much larger
and cumbersome to work with. We can use scientific notation
to express these large numbers in a much more manageable format. So we can write
299,792,458 meters per second as 3.0 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second. Correct scientific notation requires that the first term
range in value so that it is greater than one
but less than 10, and the second term represents
the power of 10 or order of magnitude by which we multiply the first term. We can use the power of 10 as a tool
in making quick estimations when we do not need or care
for the exact value of a number. For example, the diameter of an atom is approximately 10 to the power
of negative 12 meters. The height of a tree is approximately
10 to the power of one meter. The diameter of the Earth is approximately
10 to the power of seven meters. The ability to use the power of 10
as an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again, like when you're trying to guess
the number of M&M's in a jar, but is also an essential skill
in math and science, especially when dealing with
what are known as Fermi problems. Fermi problems are named
after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who's famous for making rapid
order-of-magnitude estimations, or rapid estimations,
with seemingly little available data. Fermi worked on the Manhattan Project
in developing the atomic bomb, and when it was tested
at the Trinity site in 1945, Fermi dropped a few pieces
of paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled
backwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion
as 10 kilotons of TNT, which is on the same order of magnitude
as the actual value of 20 kilotons. One example of the classic
Fermi estimation problems is to determine
how many piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago, Illinois. At first, there seem to be
so many unknowns that the problem appears to be unsolvable. That is the perfect application
for a power-of-10 estimation, as we don't need an exact answer - an estimation will work. We can start by determining how many
people live in the city of Chicago. We know that it is a large city, but we may be unsure about exactly
how many people live in the city. Are the one million people?
Five million people? This is the point in the problem where many people become frustrated
with the uncertainty, but we can easily get through this
by using the power of 10. We can estimate the magnitude
of the population of Chicago as 10 to the power of six. While this doesn't tell us exactly
how many people live there, it serves an accurate estimation
for the actual population of just under three million people. So if there are approximately
10 to the sixth people in Chicago, how many pianos are there? If we want to continue
dealing with orders of magnitude, we can either say that one out of 10 or one out of one hundred
people own a piano. Given that our estimate of the population
includes children and adults, we'll go with the latter estimate, which estimates that there are
approximately 10 to the fourth, or 10,000 pianos, in Chicago. With this many pianos,
how many piano tuners are there? We could begin the process of thinking
about how often the pianos are tuned, how many pianos are tuned in one day, or how many days a piano tuner works, but that's not the point
of rapid estimation. We instead think in orders of magnitude, and say that a piano tuner tunes roughly
10 to the second pianos in a given year, which is approximately
a few hundred pianos. Given our previous estimate
of 10 to the fourth pianos in Chicago, and the estimate that each piano tuner can
tune 10 to the second pianos each year, we can say that there are approximately
10 to the second piano tuners in Chicago. Now, I know what you must be thinking: How can all of these estimates
produce a reasonable answer? Well, it's rather simple. In any Fermi problem, it is assumed that the overestimates and underestimates
balance each other out, and produce an estimation that is usually within one order
of magnitude of the actual answer. In our case we can confirm this
by looking in the phone book for the number of piano tuners
listed in Chicago. What do we find? 81. Pretty incredible, given
our order-of-magnitude estimation. But, hey - that's the power of 10.

**Transcript**:
OK, today we're going
to talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:
"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes
in the ground and destroys gardens." And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth
on your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept
that we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything
extremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms
there are in the universe? Or in your body? Or
even in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted
to answer that question, but how do you count something
as small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea
that if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same
temperature and pressure, they would contain an equal
number of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took
him to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists
didn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way
to prove he was right. There was no clear difference
between atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work
as purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!
By late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,
and his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,
Avogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount
of particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas
at zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,
then you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion
gas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros
after it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space
due to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you
thinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams
of water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,
which is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion
molecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro
was the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this
number has a second name. The mole. Chemists use the term mole to refer to the quantities
that are at the magnitude of 602 sextillion. This is known as a molar quantity. Atoms and molecules are so small, that chemists
have bundled them into groups called moles. Moles are hard for students to understand
because they have a hard time picturing the size of a mole, or of 602 sextillion. It's just too big to wrap
our brains around. Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water? Well, that's a mole of water. But how much is that? Exactly what does 602
sextillion look like? Maybe this'll help. Exchange the water particles for donuts. If you had a mole of donuts,
they would cover the entire earth to a depth of eight kilometers, which is about five miles. You really need a lot of coffee for that. If you had a mole of basketballs,
you could create a new planet the size of the earth. If you received a mole of pennies on the day
you were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age
of 100, you would still have more than 99.99% of your money in the bank. OK. Now we sort of have an idea
how large the mole is. So how do we use it? You might be surprised to know
that chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy
grapes, deli meat, or eggs. When you go to the grocery store,
you don't go to the deli counter and ask for 43 slices of salami,
you buy your salami by the pound. When you buy your eggs,
you buy a dozen eggs. When we hear the word dozen,
we probably think of the number 12. We also know that a pair is two, a baker's dozen is 13, a gross is 144, and a ream
of paper is - anybody? A ream is 500. Well, a mole is really the same thing. For a chemist, a mole conjures
up the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal.
The only difference is that the other quantities
are more familiar to us. So there you have it -
the story of the mole, Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy
salami at the grocery store.

have bundled them into groups called moles. Moles are hard for students to understand
because they have a hard time picturing the size of a mole, or of 602 sextillion. It's just too big to wrap
our brains around. Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water? Well, that's a mole of water. But how much is that? Exactly what does 602
sextillion look like? Maybe this'll help. Exchange the water particles for donuts. If you had a mole of donuts,
they would cover the entire earth to a depth of eight kilometers, which is about five miles. You really need a lot of coffee for that. If you had a mole of basketballs,
you could create a new planet the size of the earth. If you received a mole of pennies on the day
you were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age
of 100, you would still have more than 99.99% of your money in the bank. OK. Now we sort of have an idea
how large the mole is. So how do we use it? You might be surprised to know
that chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy
grapes, deli meat, or eggs. When you go to the grocery store,
you don't go to the deli counter and ask for 43 slices of salami,
you buy your salami by the pound. When you buy your eggs,
you buy a dozen eggs. When we hear the word dozen,
we probably think of the number 12. We also know that a pair is two, a baker's dozen is 13, a gross is 144, and a ream
of paper is - anybody? A ream is 500. Well, a mole is really the same thing. For a chemist, a mole conjures
up the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal.
The only difference is that the other quantities
are more familiar to us. So there you have it -
the story of the mole, Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy

OK, today we're going
to talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:
"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes
in the ground and destroys gardens." And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth
on your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept
that we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything
extremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms
there are in the universe? Or in your body? Or
even in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted
to answer that question, but how do you count something
as small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea
that if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same
temperature and pressure, they would contain an equal
number of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took
him to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists
didn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way
to prove he was right. There was no clear difference
between atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work
as purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!
By late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,
and his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,
Avogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount
of particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas
at zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,
then you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion
gas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros
after it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space
due to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you
thinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams
of water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,
which is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion
molecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro
was the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this

**Transcript**:
What is proof? And why is it so important in mathematics? Proofs provide a solid
foundation for mathematicians logicians, statisticians,
economists, architects, engineers, and many others to build
and test their theories on. And they're just plain awesome! Let me start at the beginning. I'll introduce you
to a fellow named Euclid. As in, "here's looking at you, Clid." He lived in Greece about 2,300 years ago, and he's considered by many to be
the father of geometry. So if you've been wondering where
to send your geometry fan mail, Euclid of Alexandria is the guy
to thank for proofs. Euclid is not really known for inventing
or discovering a lot of mathematics but he revolutionized the way
in which it is written, presented, and thought about. Euclid set out to formalize mathematics
by establishing the rules of the game. These rules of the game are called axioms. Once you have the rules, Euclid says you have to use them
to prove what you think is true. If you can't, then your theorem or idea might be false. And if your theorem is false, then
any theorems that come after it and use it might be false too. Like how one misplaced beam can
bring down the whole house. So that's all that proofs are: using well-established rules to prove
beyond a doubt that some theorem is true. Then you use those theorems like blocks to build mathematics. Let's check out an example. Say I want to prove
that these two triangles are the same size and shape. In other words, they are congruent. Well, one way to do
that is to write a proof that shows that all three sides
of one triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the other triangle. So how do we prove it? First, I'll write down what we know. We know that point M
is the midpoint of AB. We also know that sides AC
and BC are already congruent. Now let's see. What does
the midpoint tell us? Luckily, I know
the definition of midpoint. It is basically the point in the middle. What this means is that AM
and BM are the same length, since M is the exact middle of AB. In other words, the bottom side
of each of our triangles are congruent. I'll put that as step two. Great! So far I have two pairs
of sides that are congruent. The last one is easy. The third side of the left triangle is CM, and the third side
of the right triangle is - well, also CM. They share the same side. Of course it's congruent to itself! This is called the reflexive property. Everything is congruent to itself. I'll put this as step three. Ta dah! You've just proven
that all three sides of the left triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the right triangle. Plus, the two triangles are congruent because of the side-side-side
congruence theorem for triangles. When finished with a proof,
I like to do what Euclid did. He marked the end of a proof
with the letters QED. It's Latin for "quod erat demonstrandum," which translates literally to "what was to be proven." But I just think of it
as "look what I just did!" I can hear what you're thinking: why should I study proofs? One reason is that they could
allow you to win any argument. Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest
leaders of all time used to keep a copy of Euclid's Elements
on his bedside table to keep his mind in shape. Another reason is you can
make a million dollars. You heard me. One million dollars. That's the price that the Clay
Mathematics Institute in Massachusetts is willing to pay anyone who proves
one of the many unproven theories that it calls "the millenium problems." A couple of these have been solved
in the 90s and 2000s. But beyond money and arguments, proofs are everywhere. They underly architecture, art, computer
programming, and internet security. If no one understood
or could generate a proof, we could not advance these
essential parts of our world. Finally, we all know
that the proof is in the pudding. And pudding is delicious. QED.

that these two triangles are the same size and shape. In other words, they are congruent. Well, one way to do
that is to write a proof that shows that all three sides
of one triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the other triangle. So how do we prove it? First, I'll write down what we know. We know that point M
is the midpoint of AB. We also know that sides AC
and BC are already congruent. Now let's see. What does
the midpoint tell us? Luckily, I know
the definition of midpoint. It is basically the point in the middle. What this means is that AM
and BM are the same length, since M is the exact middle of AB. In other words, the bottom side
of each of our triangles are congruent. I'll put that as step two. Great! So far I have two pairs
of sides that are congruent. The last one is easy. The third side of the left triangle is CM, and the third side
of the right triangle is - well, also CM. They share the same side. Of course it's congruent to itself! This is called the reflexive property. Everything is congruent to itself. I'll put this as step three. Ta dah! You've just proven
that all three sides of the left triangle are congruent to all three sides
of the right triangle. Plus, the two triangles are congruent because of the side-side-side
congruence theorem for triangles. When finished with a proof,
I like to do what Euclid did. He marked the end of a proof
with the letters QED. It's Latin for "quod erat demonstrandum," which translates literally to "what was to be proven." But I just think of it
as "look what I just did!" I can hear what you're thinking: why should I study proofs? One reason is that they could
allow you to win any argument. Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest
leaders of all time used to keep a copy of Euclid's Elements
on his bedside table to keep his mind in shape. Another reason is you can
make a million dollars. You heard me. One million dollars. That's the price that the Clay
Mathematics Institute in Massachusetts is willing to pay anyone who proves
one of the many unproven theories that it calls "the millenium problems." A couple of these have been solved
in the 90s and 2000s. But beyond money and arguments, proofs are everywhere. They underly architecture, art, computer
programming, and internet security. If no one understood
or could generate a proof, we could not advance these
essential parts of our world. Finally, we all know
that the proof is in the pudding. And pudding is delicious. QED.

What is proof? And why is it so important in mathematics? Proofs provide a solid
foundation for mathematicians logicians, statisticians,
economists, architects, engineers, and many others to build
and test their theories on. And they're just plain awesome! Let me start at the beginning. I'll introduce you
to a fellow named Euclid. As in, "here's looking at you, Clid." He lived in Greece about 2,300 years ago, and he's considered by many to be
the father of geometry. So if you've been wondering where
to send your geometry fan mail, Euclid of Alexandria is the guy
to thank for proofs. Euclid is not really known for inventing
or discovering a lot of mathematics but he revolutionized the way
in which it is written, presented, and thought about. Euclid set out to formalize mathematics
by establishing the rules of the game. These rules of the game are called axioms. Once you have the rules, Euclid says you have to use them
to prove what you think is true. If you can't, then your theorem or idea might be false. And if your theorem is false, then
any theorems that come after it and use it might be false too. Like how one misplaced beam can
bring down the whole house. So that's all that proofs are: using well-established rules to prove

**Transcript**:
Some of the best opportunities to learn are the moments in which we are perplexed. Those moments in which you
begin to wonder and question. These moments have happened
throughout history. and have led to some truly
amazing discoveries. Take this story, for example. There once was a fellow named Archimedes. He was born in 287 B.C. in the city
of Syracuse in Sicily. He was a Greek mathematician,
physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. One day, Archimedes was summoned
by the king of Sicily to investigate if he had
been cheated by a goldsmith. The king said he had given a goldsmith
the exact amount of gold needed to make a crown. However, when the crown was ready, the king
suspected that the goldsmith cheated and slipped some silver into the crown, keeping some of the gold for himself. The king asked Archimedes
to solve the problem. But there was a catch: he couldn't
do any damage to the crown. One day, while taking his bath, Archimedes noticed that the water
level in the bathtub rose and overflowed as he immersed
himself into the tub. He suddenly realized that how much
water was displaced depended on how much
of his body was immersed. This discovery excited him so much
that he jumped out of the tub and ran through the streets
naked, shouting "Eureka!" Which comes from the ancient
Greek meaning "I found it." What did he find? Well, he found a way
to solve the king's problem. You see, Archimedes needed
to check the crown's density to see if it was the same
as the density of pure gold. Density is a measure of an object's mass
divided by its volume. Pure gold is very dense,
while silver is less dense. So if there was silver in the crown, it would be
less dense than if it were made of pure gold. But no matter what it was made of,
the crown would be the same shape, which means the same volume. So if Archimedes could measure
the mass of the crown first, and then measure its volume, he could find out how dense it was. But it is not easy to measure
a crown's volume - it has an irregular shape, that's different
from a simple box or ball. You can't measure its size and multiply
like you might for other shapes. The solution, Archimedes realized, was to give the crown a bath. by placing it in water and seeing
how much water was displaced, he could measure the volume, and he'd calculate
the density of the crown. If the crown was less
dense than pure gold, then the goldsmith most definitely
cheated the king. When Archimedes went back
to the king and did his test, the story says, he found that the goldsmith
had indeed cheated the king, and slipped some silver in. These days, using the way an object displaces
water to measure volume is called Archimedes' principle. The
next time you take a bath, you can see Archimedes'
principle in action, and maybe you'll have
a genius idea of your own.

**Transcript**:
Some of the best opportunities to learn are the moments in which we are perplexed. Those moments in which you
begin to wonder and question. These moments have happened
throughout history. and have led to some truly
amazing discoveries. Take this story, for example. There once was a fellow named Archimedes. He was born in 287 B.C. in the city
of Syracuse in Sicily. He was a Greek mathematician,
physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. One day, Archimedes was summoned
by the king of Sicily to investigate if he had
been cheated by a goldsmith. The king said he had given a goldsmith
the exact amount of gold needed to make a crown. However, when the crown was ready, the king
suspected that the goldsmith cheated and slipped some silver into the crown, keeping some of the gold for himself. The king asked Archimedes
to solve the problem. But there was a catch: he couldn't
do any damage to the crown. One day, while taking his bath, Archimedes noticed that the water
level in the bathtub rose and overflowed as he immersed
himself into the tub. He suddenly realized that how much
water was displaced depended on how much
of his body was immersed. This discovery excited him so much
that he jumped out of the tub and ran through the streets
naked, shouting "Eureka!" Which comes from the ancient
Greek meaning "I found it." What did he find? Well, he found a way
to solve the king's problem. You see, Archimedes needed
to check the crown's density to see if it was the same
as the density of pure gold. Density is a measure of an object's mass
divided by its volume. Pure gold is very dense,
while silver is less dense. So if there was silver in the crown, it would be
less dense than if it were made of pure gold. But no matter what it was made of,
the crown would be the same shape, which means the same volume. So if Archimedes could measure
the mass of the crown first, and then measure its volume, he could find out how dense it was. But it is not easy to measure
a crown's volume - it has an irregular shape, that's different
from a simple box or ball. You can't measure its size and multiply
like you might for other shapes. The solution, Archimedes realized, was to give the crown a bath. by placing it in water and seeing
how much water was displaced, he could measure the volume, and he'd calculate
the density of the crown. If the crown was less
dense than pure gold, then the goldsmith most definitely
cheated the king. When Archimedes went back
to the king and did his test, the story says, he found that the goldsmith
had indeed cheated the king, and slipped some silver in. These days, using the way an object displaces
water to measure volume is called Archimedes' principle. The
next time you take a bath, you can see Archimedes'
principle in action, and maybe you'll have
a genius idea of your own.

**Transcript**:
If you think of culture as an iceberg, only a small fraction of it is visible. Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools, are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate. However, only when we look deeper, under the water, are we able to focus on the common values that connect us. In what seems to be an increasingly troubled world, where social and political systems are being stretched, conflict within and between countries is at times heightened, while human rights are being ignored, this desire for peace grows ever stronger. Sometimes we see this common value emerging above the surface and becoming visible. For example, it is part of everyday language used when people greet one another and welcome the new day. In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia, such as Bangladesh for example, the greeting of "as-salamu alaykum" can be translated to "peace be with you." The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan, where greetings of "namaste," which has not only a strong message of peace - "the spirit in me greets the spirit in you" - but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart, to honor a special place in each of us. In Myanmar, greetings of "mingalarbar" are met by bowing monks as they internalize a message where others add blessing to enhance the auspiciousness of the moment, or by giggling children as they scurry off to school. After many hours of hiking through the mountains of Lesotho, surrounded by the tranquility and rugged terrain, you are likely to meet a herdboy who has slept the night in a vacant rondoval and bellows out greetings of "lumela" or "khotso", which means "peace be with you." If you took a moment to research further the meanings behind "shalom," or the Korean greeting, you would find that they too have deeply-seated connections to peace. However, they have become quick comments made to welcome, greet, and say hello, and in this overuse, have likely lost the focus that was originally intended when put into practice hundreds or thousands of years ago. In highlighting this simple evidence of ingrained behavior, we can create the necessary shift in thinking needed to incorporate flexibility and open-mindedness in us all when looking at the globalization of the world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
If you think of culture as an iceberg, only a small fraction of it is visible. Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools, are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate. However, only when we look deeper, under the water, are we able to focus on the common values that connect us. In what seems to be an increasingly troubled world, where social and political systems are being stretched, conflict within and between countries is at times heightened, while human rights are being ignored, this desire for peace grows ever stronger. Sometimes we see this common value emerging above the surface and becoming visible. For example, it is part of everyday language used when people greet one another and welcome the new day. In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia, such as Bangladesh for example, the greeting of "as-salamu alaykum" can be translated to "peace be with you." The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan, where greetings of "namaste," which has not only a strong message of peace - "the spirit in me greets the spirit in you" - but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart, to honor a special place in each of us. In Myanmar, greetings of "mingalarbar" are met by bowing monks as they internalize a message where others add blessing to enhance the auspiciousness of the moment, or by giggling children as they scurry off to school. After many hours of hiking through the mountains of Lesotho, surrounded by the tranquility and rugged terrain, you are likely to meet a herdboy who has slept the night in a vacant rondoval and bellows out greetings of "lumela" or "khotso", which means "peace be with you." If you took a moment to research further the meanings behind "shalom," or the Korean greeting, you would find that they too have deeply-seated connections to peace. However, they have become quick comments made to welcome, greet, and say hello, and in this overuse, have likely lost the focus that was originally intended when put into practice hundreds or thousands of years ago. In highlighting this simple evidence of ingrained behavior, we can create the necessary shift in thinking needed to incorporate flexibility and open-mindedness in us all when looking at the globalization of the world.
