**Transcript**:
In 1996, a British Airways plane
flew from New York to London in a record-breaking 
two hours and 53 minutes. Today, however, passengers flying 
the same route can expect to spend no less than six hours
in the air— twice as long. So why, in a world where everything 
seems to be getting faster, have commercial flights lagged behind? The British-and-French-made Concorde
began shuttling passengers across the sky in the 1970s. Jetting between destinations like 
New York, Paris, Bahrain, and Singapore, it clocked in at over 2,000 kilometers 
per hour, more than twice the speed
of a normal airliner. However this was also about 800 kilometers
per hour faster than the speed of sound. And that created a surprising problem 
for people on the ground. When an object moves at supersonic speed, it generates a continuous moving shockwave
known as a sonic boom. This produces a loud, startling noise, as well as rattling windows and dislodging
structural elements of buildings. Since a plane flying at an altitude 
of 15 kilometers can affect an area with an 80 kilometer
diameter on the ground below, complaints and concerns from residents 
in the Concorde’s flight path restricted it to mostly ocean routes. Because of these restrictions and other
fuel and engineering requirements, supersonic flights turned out 
to be very expensive for both airlines and passengers. A single transatlantic
round-trip could cost the equivalent of more than $10,000 today. With additional strain 
on the airline industry due to decreased demand for flights
after September 11th, 2001, this became unsustainable, 
and the Concorde was retired in 2003. So even when superfast flights existed,
they weren't standard commercial flights. And while we might think that advances 
in flight technology would make fast flights less expensive, 
this hasn’t necessarily been the case. One of the biggest concerns 
is fuel economy. Over the decades, jet engines have become
a lot more efficient, taking in more air 
and achieving more thrust— traveling further for every
liter of fuel. But this efficiency is only achieved 
at speeds of up to around 900 kilometers per hour—
less than half the speed of the Concorde. Going any faster would increase air intake
and burn more fuel per kilometer flown. A standard transatlantic flight still uses
as much as 150,000 liters of fuel, amounting to over 20% 
of an airline’s total expenses. So any reduction in fuel economy 
and increase in speed would significantly increase both 
flight costs and environmental impact. What about ways to make a plane faster 
without burning lots of fuel? Adjusting the wing sweep, or the angle
at which wings protrude from the fuselage, to bring the wings closer in can 
make an aircraft faster by reducing aerodynamic drag. But this means the wings must be longer
to achieve the same wingspan, and that means more materials
and more weight, which in turn means burning more fuel. So while airplanes could be designed
to be more aerodynamic, this would make them more expensive. And generally, airlines have found 
that customer demand for faster flights is not sufficient to cover these costs. So while military aircraft conduct 
high speed flights over water and at high altitudes, supersonic commercial flights seemed
like a brief and failed experiment. But recent advances
may make them feasible again. Research by NASA and DARPA has shown 
that modifying an aircraft’s shape can reduce the impact 
of its sonic boom by 1/3. Extending the nose with a long spike can
break the shockwave into smaller ones, while another proposed design features 
two sets of wings producing waves 
that cancel each other out. And new technologies may solve 
the energy efficiency problem with alternative and synthetic fuels,
or even hybrid-electric planes. It may yet turn out that the last 
few decades of steady flying were just a brief rest stop.

diameter on the ground below, complaints and concerns from residents 
in the Concorde’s flight path restricted it to mostly ocean routes. Because of these restrictions and other
fuel and engineering requirements, supersonic flights turned out 
to be very expensive for both airlines and passengers. A single transatlantic
round-trip could cost the equivalent of more than $10,000 today. With additional strain 
on the airline industry due to decreased demand for flights
after September 11th, 2001, this became unsustainable, 
and the Concorde was retired in 2003. So even when superfast flights existed,
they weren't standard commercial flights. And while we might think that advances 
in flight technology would make fast flights less expensive, 
this hasn’t necessarily been the case. One of the biggest concerns 
is fuel economy. Over the decades, jet engines have become
a lot more efficient, taking in more air 
and achieving more thrust— traveling further for every
liter of fuel. But this efficiency is only achieved 
at speeds of up to around 900 kilometers per hour—
less than half the speed of the Concorde. Going any faster would increase air intake
and burn more fuel per kilometer flown. A standard transatlantic flight still uses
as much as 150,000 liters of fuel, amounting to over 20% 
of an airline’s total expenses. So any reduction in fuel economy 
and increase in speed would significantly increase both 
flight costs and environmental impact. What about ways to make a plane faster 
without burning lots of fuel? Adjusting the wing sweep, or the angle
at which wings protrude from the fuselage, to bring the wings closer in can 
make an aircraft faster by reducing aerodynamic drag. But this means the wings must be longer
to achieve the same wingspan, and that means more materials
and more weight, which in turn means burning more fuel. So while airplanes could be designed
to be more aerodynamic, this would make them more expensive. And generally, airlines have found 
that customer demand for faster flights is not sufficient to cover these costs. So while military aircraft conduct 
high speed flights over water and at high altitudes, supersonic commercial flights seemed
like a brief and failed experiment. But recent advances
may make them feasible again. Research by NASA and DARPA has shown 
that modifying an aircraft’s shape can reduce the impact 
of its sonic boom by 1/3. Extending the nose with a long spike can
break the shockwave into smaller ones, while another proposed design features 
two sets of wings producing waves 
that cancel each other out. And new technologies may solve 
the energy efficiency problem with alternative and synthetic fuels,
or even hybrid-electric planes. It may yet turn out that the last 
few decades of steady flying were just a brief rest stop.

And the clock starts... now. Did you miss it? It wasn’t some bug buzzing by 
or a weird trick of the light. You just saw a hummingbird perform
astonishing aerial acrobatics, eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,
and then escape a threat upside down— all in a matter of seconds. So let’s slow down the action, and unpack
each step in this blazing-fast feast. First up, their incredibly rapid flight. Hummingbirds typically beat their wings 
30 to 40 times per second, creating the high-frequency hum 
they’re named for. To flap their wings at this speed, hummingbirds have evolved 
giant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third 
of some species’ bodyweight. But the real secret to their fine-tuned
flight is all in the wrist. Most birds only generate lift 
on the downstroke of each flap, while using the upward recovery stroke 
to set up their next wing beat. Hummingbirds however, 
turn their wrists during the upstroke, changing their wing’s angle to flap 
in a figure 8 pattern that continually generates lift 
throughout their wingbeats. Alongside their massive muscles,
this special lift-producing technique allows hummingbirds to achieve 
sustained hovering flight— an aerial feat no other bird can perform. Hovering lets hummingbirds slow 
to a stop almost instantly and assess scenarios in midair. Then, they can take off in any direction, reaching speeds faster than a fighter jet,
relative to the bird’s size. And since they can beat each of their
wings at different speeds and angles, the birds can perform 
incredible spins and turns all while flying backwards 
or even upside down. Of course, flying this way 
can be exhausting. Hovering is one of the most energy
intensive forms of movement in the animal kingdom. And relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the highest 
metabolic rates of all vertebrates. This leads them to eat very frequently— often consuming an average 
of four meals an hour while flying. Fortunately, their hovering lets them eat
at remarkable angles without perching, consuming food that would otherwise
be impossible to reach. Using their long slender bills, they reach deep inside flowers 
and pump out nectar with their thin grooved tongues. This sugary liquid is a hummingbird’s
most important energy source, and a single bird consumes six times 
its weight in nectar every day over hundreds of small meals. Each of these sugary snacks also 
pollinates the flower being visited with pollen left on the bird 
from previous meals. That's just a rough idea of what
hummingbirds can do in several seconds. But if we hang around a little longer, we might see their aerial acrobatics
put to a more dangerous test. Hummingbirds keep track of which flowers
they've recently drained, as well as those they plan to drain next. And each bird will fight ruthlessly 
to defend this floral territory from their only real competition: 
other hummingbirds. Using their spear-like bills 
and blindingly fast flight, dueling hummingbirds chase each other 
through the air, aggressively stabbing 
and plucking feathers. The bills of some species are specialized
for fighting, with spiny tips, hooks, 
or even saw-like serrations. Some hummingbirds employ 
these aerial fencing techniques to chase off larger birds 
like hawks and owls. But the most extreme fights are between
male hummingbirds competing for flowers and females. Fortunately, these duels 
are rarely deadly. After 15 to 20 seconds, one bird
will typically surrender— flying off to seek its breakfast 
elsewhere. After all this fighting, feeding, 
and flying, hummingbirds sometimes need 
to sleep off the day’s events in a mild form of hibernation 
called torpor. Their hearts— proportionally 
the largest in the animal kingdom— slow from 1,200 beats per minute 
to a mere 50. But when they wake up 4 to 7 hours later, their lightning-fast metabolism 
kicks back into gear. With all this speed and strength, it’s no wonder the Aztecs revered 
these energetic birds as agents of the god of war 
Huitzilopotchli— a reminder that immense power 
can come in the smallest packages.

giant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third 
of some species’ bodyweight. But the real secret to their fine-tuned
flight is all in the wrist. Most birds only generate lift 
on the downstroke of each flap, while using the upward recovery stroke 
to set up their next wing beat. Hummingbirds however, 
turn their wrists during the upstroke, changing their wing’s angle to flap 
in a figure 8 pattern that continually generates lift 
throughout their wingbeats. Alongside their massive muscles,
this special lift-producing technique allows hummingbirds to achieve 
sustained hovering flight— an aerial feat no other bird can perform. Hovering lets hummingbirds slow 
to a stop almost instantly and assess scenarios in midair. Then, they can take off in any direction, reaching speeds faster than a fighter jet,
relative to the bird’s size. And since they can beat each of their
wings at different speeds and angles, the birds can perform 
incredible spins and turns all while flying backwards 
or even upside down. Of course, flying this way 
can be exhausting. Hovering is one of the most energy
intensive forms of movement in the animal kingdom. And relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the highest 
metabolic rates of all vertebrates. This leads them to eat very frequently— often consuming an average 
of four meals an hour while flying. Fortunately, their hovering lets them eat
at remarkable angles without perching, consuming food that would otherwise
be impossible to reach. Using their long slender bills, they reach deep inside flowers 
and pump out nectar with their thin grooved tongues. This sugary liquid is a hummingbird’s
most important energy source, and a single bird consumes six times 
its weight in nectar every day over hundreds of small meals. Each of these sugary snacks also 
pollinates the flower being visited with pollen left on the bird 
from previous meals. That's just a rough idea of what
hummingbirds can do in several seconds. But if we hang around a little longer, we might see their aerial acrobatics
put to a more dangerous test. Hummingbirds keep track of which flowers
they've recently drained, as well as those they plan to drain next. And each bird will fight ruthlessly 
to defend this floral territory from their only real competition: 
other hummingbirds. Using their spear-like bills 
and blindingly fast flight, dueling hummingbirds chase each other 
through the air, aggressively stabbing 
and plucking feathers. The bills of some species are specialized
for fighting, with spiny tips, hooks, 
or even saw-like serrations. Some hummingbirds employ 
these aerial fencing techniques to chase off larger birds 
like hawks and owls. But the most extreme fights are between
male hummingbirds competing for flowers and females. Fortunately, these duels 
are rarely deadly. After 15 to 20 seconds, one bird
will typically surrender— flying off to seek its breakfast 
elsewhere. After all this fighting, feeding, 
and flying, hummingbirds sometimes need 
to sleep off the day’s events in a mild form of hibernation 
called torpor. Their hearts— proportionally 
the largest in the animal kingdom— slow from 1,200 beats per minute 
to a mere 50. But when they wake up 4 to 7 hours later, their lightning-fast metabolism 
kicks back into gear. With all this speed and strength, it’s no wonder the Aztecs revered 
these energetic birds as agents of the god of war 
Huitzilopotchli— a reminder that immense power 
can come in the smallest packages.

And the clock starts... now. Did you miss it? It wasn’t some bug buzzing by 
or a weird trick of the light. You just saw a hummingbird perform
astonishing aerial acrobatics, eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,
and then escape a threat upside down— all in a matter of seconds. So let’s slow down the action, and unpack
each step in this blazing-fast feast. First up, their incredibly rapid flight. Hummingbirds typically beat their wings 
30 to 40 times per second, creating the high-frequency hum 
they’re named for. To flap their wings at this speed, hummingbirds have evolved 
giant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third

Autism is something
that many people know about. For example, some people think that autistic people
are fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on
about the same topic. Some people think that autistic people
do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing
at the wrong time. Some people think that autistic people
are socially awkward and lack humor and empathy. Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have
the right impression of autism. How do I know? Because I have autism. I do have my own obsessions
with things like electronics and public transit, but that does not define me. Each of us are different
and unique in our own way. However, there is not
a lot of information out there on what an autistic life
actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes. And we see these often in the media. Some of the more common
stereotypes in the media include being socially awkward, lacking empathy and even being a supergenius. And the lack of knowledge
on autism doesn't stop there either. Did you know that some people
are trying to find a cure for autism? That's because they see it
as a negative thing, as a disease. Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism
is not a disease. It's just another way of thinking
and looking at the world. Our brains function differently
from most people's brains. Think of it like comparing
and Xbox and a PlayStation. They're both highly capable consoles
with different programming. But if you put your Xbox game
in a PlayStation, it won't work, because the PlayStation
communicates differently. When I look in the mirror, I see someone who thinks differently. Oh, and I also see nice hair. (Laughter) (Applause) But the question is, am I really diseased
if I just think differently? The main problem with living autistic
in today's society is that the world just isn't built for us. There's so many ways
that we can get overwhelmed. For example, the thing that makes me overwhelmed
all the time is loud noises, which means I never
crank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan
of large parties. But other people on the spectrum
might get overwhelmed with things like bright lights
or strong smells or gooey textures that all have the potential
to create anxiety. Think about all of the social gatherings
you've been to in the past. Was there loud music playing? Were there really bright lights? Were there lots of different food smells
going on at the same time? Were there lots of conversations
happening all at once? Those things may not
have bothered you guys, but for someone with autism, they can be quite overwhelming. So in those situations,
we do something called stimming, which is like a repetitive
motion or a noise or some other random fidgeting
that may or may not seem normal. Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin. Ya, it's basically our way of zoning out. It can often feel necessary
for us to stim. However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it. When we're forced to hide
our autistic traits like this, it's called masking. And some people mask better than others. I mask so well sometimes
that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal. (Laughs) But at the end of the day,
it gets really stressful. Even something like
doing my homework at night becomes very tiring. Some people think, because of our ability to mask, that this is the cure to autism. However, all it really does
is makes us ashamed of showing our true selves. Another common stereotype
that is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy. And again, this is not true. I actually have lots of empathy. I'm just not really good at showing it. Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggles
that they're going through, I often don't know
how to express my reply. And that is why I don't show
as much empathy as my nonautistic friends do. Emotional expression,
however much or however little, is difficult for me. And that is because I am bursting inside with every single emotion
one feels at all times. Though of course,
I cannot express it that way. Otherwise, let's say,
happiness, for example, would come out as a huge burst
of gleeful wheezing, hand flapping and loud vocal "woohoos." (Laughter) Whereas you may just smile. (Laughter) Whether it be receiving
an awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic
story on the news, I cannot really express my reply
without bursting, so once again, I have to mask it
in order to appear normal. My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me
express extremes or nothing. So my ... I am not great with my emotions, and I communicate differently, and because of that, I was diagnosed
with autism spectrum disorder. This diagnosis helps me
and my friends and family to know how my mind works. And in the world, approximately one percent
of the population is diagnosed with autism
spectrum disorder. And this number is growing. However, we are still a big minority. And there's still lots of people
that do not see us as equals to other people. This is my family. And in my family, there is one other person
who is also autistic. My mother. Yes, adult women can also be autistic. My dad and my brother
are both nonautistic. Sometimes it can be a bit difficult
for us to communicate with each other, however. Sometimes I'll say something like, "Oh, Toronto's Union Station, right?" thinking that I can help them to remember
certain aspects of it. When they get confused, I often
have to elaborate myself on that. And we often have to say things in a number of different ways
so that everyone understands. However, despite all that, we all love each other
and respect each other as equals. In his book "NeuroTribes," author Steve Silberman states
that autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, naturally part of a human spectrum and not as defects. And this is something
that I agree to completely. If autism was seen as part
of a natural human spectrum, then the world could be designed
to work better for autistic people. I am not ashamed of my autism. And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human
and I am not diseased. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
After much debate, the fantasy realm 
you call home has decided dragon jousting may not be 
the best way to choose its leaders, and has begun transitioning to democracy. The candidates are a giant orange troll
and an experienced tree statesman. An all-powerful eyebrow has hired 
your company— The Dormor Polling Agency— to survey the citizens of the land
and predict who will win. There’s a lot riding on this: if you get it wrong, heads— 
well, your head— will quite literally roll. Your job is to go from door to door, asking voters whether they prefer
the troll or the treefellow and to use the results to project 
how the election will go. Your fellow citizens want you to succeed
and would tell you the truth... but there’s a problem. Few are willing to admit 
they support the troll on account of his controversial 
life choices. If you were to ask a troll supporter
who she'll vote for, there’s a good chance that she’ll claim 
to support the treeman, skewing your results. You’re about to begin your rounds when 
a stranger offers you some cryptic advice: “Here’s the question that will save your
neck: what have you got in your pocket?” You reach into your pocket and pull out...
a silver coin, which has the current king’s head 
on one side and his tail on the other. How can you use it to conduct
an accurate poll? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to use the coin 
to add random chance to your interaction that will give 
troll supporters deniability. In other words, you’re looking for 
a system where when someone says “troll,” it could either be because the coin 
somehow told them to, or because they actually 
support the troll— and you’d have no way to tell 
the difference. You’ll also need to know how frequently 
the coin skewed the results, so you can account
for it in your calculations. One solution is to have every pollee 
go into their house and flip the coin. If it lands heads, they should
tell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell 
you their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say 
they’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,
the coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes 
off his total, and know the troll’s real support 
is 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,
but before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in 
and burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed
constitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place 
in a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back 
out on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable
admitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a
dragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. 
How do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking 
just one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave 
space for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two
possible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone
flip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads
twice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails 
twice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination
to declare their true preference. The chances of getting either
two heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— 
or 25%. Subtracting that proportion 
of the total respondents from each candidate’s score should 
give you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced 
themselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll 
and another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals
that voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,
the troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Suppose there are two candidates A and B. You poll 300 people with the following rule: each person P flips a fair coin twice. If the coin comes up heads both times, then P should vote for A. If the coin comes up tails both times, then P should vote for B. Otherwise P should vote for the candidate P prefers. If 20% of the people like A and 80% like B, approximately what poll score will A receive?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but it shares similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8: What is the probability of a voter getting two heads or two tails in a row when flipping a coin twice? Options: A. 25%, B. 50%, C. 75%, D. 100%

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, as it only asks about the probability of getting two heads or two tails, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the predicted poll score for candidate A.

A more relevant question that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent is not present among the generated MCQs. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7: How does the pollster modify the polling process to account for the new challenge in the second scenario? is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it discusses the modified polling process that involves flipping a coin twice.

But if I really had to choose one that could be a potential match, I would say Question 3: How does the pollster use the silver coin to conduct an accurate poll in the first scenario? is not a match but, a new question that could be generated based on question 3, 7, and 8 could be a potential match.

However, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ based on the current options:

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
After much debate, the fantasy realm 
you call home has decided dragon jousting may not be 
the best way to choose its leaders, and has begun transitioning to democracy. The candidates are a giant orange troll
and an experienced tree statesman. An all-powerful eyebrow has hired 
your company— The Dormor Polling Agency— to survey the citizens of the land
and predict who will win. There’s a lot riding on this: if you get it wrong, heads— 
well, your head— will quite literally roll. Your job is to go from door to door, asking voters whether they prefer
the troll or the treefellow and to use the results to project 
how the election will go. Your fellow citizens want you to succeed
and would tell you the truth... but there’s a problem. Few are willing to admit 
they support the troll on account of his controversial 
life choices. If you were to ask a troll supporter
who she'll vote for, there’s a good chance that she’ll claim 
to support the treeman, skewing your results. You’re about to begin your rounds when 
a stranger offers you some cryptic advice: “Here’s the question that will save your
neck: what have you got in your pocket?” You reach into your pocket and pull out...
a silver coin, which has the current king’s head 
on one side and his tail on the other. How can you use it to conduct
an accurate poll? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to use the coin 
to add random chance to your interaction that will give 
troll supporters deniability. In other words, you’re looking for 
a system where when someone says “troll,” it could either be because the coin 
somehow told them to, or because they actually 
support the troll— and you’d have no way to tell 
the difference. You’ll also need to know how frequently 
the coin skewed the results, so you can account
for it in your calculations. One solution is to have every pollee 
go into their house and flip the coin. If it lands heads, they should
tell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell 
you their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say 
they’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,
the coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes 
off his total, and know the troll’s real support 
is 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,
but before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in 
and burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed
constitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place 
in a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back 
out on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable
admitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a
dragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. 
How do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking 
just one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave 
space for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two
possible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone
flip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads
twice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails 
twice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination
to declare their true preference. The chances of getting either
two heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— 
or 25%. Subtracting that proportion 
of the total respondents from each candidate’s score should 
give you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced 
themselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll 
and another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals
that voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,
the troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest that Question 7 is the closest match.

Question 7 discusses a scenario where the pollster modifies the polling process to account for a new challenge by having the voters flip the coin twice and telling them to report "troll" if they get two heads, "dragon" if they get two tails, and their actual preference otherwise. Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it shares similarities with the concept of using coin flips to disguise voter preferences and adjusting the results accordingly.

However, if I had to choose a question that could be modified to match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 7. To make it more similar, the question could be revised to include three coin flips and three candidates, with the voters reporting their actual preference if they don't get three heads or three tails.

**Transcript**:
After much debate, the fantasy realm 
you call home has decided dragon jousting may not be 
the best way to choose its leaders, and has begun transitioning to democracy. The candidates are a giant orange troll
and an experienced tree statesman. An all-powerful eyebrow has hired 
your company— The Dormor Polling Agency— to survey the citizens of the land
and predict who will win. There’s a lot riding on this: if you get it wrong, heads— 
well, your head— will quite literally roll. Your job is to go from door to door, asking voters whether they prefer
the troll or the treefellow and to use the results to project 
how the election will go. Your fellow citizens want you to succeed
and would tell you the truth... but there’s a problem. Few are willing to admit 
they support the troll on account of his controversial 
life choices. If you were to ask a troll supporter
who she'll vote for, there’s a good chance that she’ll claim 
to support the treeman, skewing your results. You’re about to begin your rounds when 
a stranger offers you some cryptic advice: “Here’s the question that will save your
neck: what have you got in your pocket?” You reach into your pocket and pull out...
a silver coin, which has the current king’s head 
on one side and his tail on the other. How can you use it to conduct
an accurate poll? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to use the coin 
to add random chance to your interaction that will give 
troll supporters deniability. In other words, you’re looking for 
a system where when someone says “troll,” it could either be because the coin 
somehow told them to, or because they actually 
support the troll— and you’d have no way to tell 
the difference. You’ll also need to know how frequently 
the coin skewed the results, so you can account
for it in your calculations. One solution is to have every pollee 
go into their house and flip the coin. If it lands heads, they should
tell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell 
you their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say 
they’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,
the coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes 
off his total, and know the troll’s real support 
is 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,
but before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in 
and burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed
constitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place 
in a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back 
out on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable
admitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a
dragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. 
How do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking 
just one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave 
space for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two
possible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone
flip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads
twice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails 
twice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination
to declare their true preference. The chances of getting either
two heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— 
or 25%. Subtracting that proportion 
of the total respondents from each candidate’s score should 
give you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced 
themselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll 
and another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals
that voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,
the troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ is related to a scenario with three candidates and a coin flip three times, which is not present in the generated MCQs.

However, if we consider the closest match in terms of the concept of adjusting the poll score based on the coin's influence, we can consider Question 9: How is the result of the second poll adjusted to account for the coin's influence? Options: A. By adding 25% of the total respondents to each candidate's score., B. By subtracting 25% of the total respondents from each candidate's score., C. By adding 50% of the total respondents to each candidate's score., D. By subtracting 50% of the total respondents from each candidate's score.

But this is still not a good match as the ground truth MCQ is asking about the poll score of a specific candidate, whereas Question 9 is asking about the adjustment method.

Therefore, I would say that there is no good match among the generated MCQs for the given ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Historically, most cars have run 
on gasoline, but that doesn’t have to be
the case in the future: other liquid fuels and electricity
can also power cars. So what are the differences 
between these options? And which one’s best? Gasoline is refined from crude oil, a fossil fuel extracted
from deep underground. The energy in gasoline comes from a class
of molecules called hydrocarbons. There are hundreds of different
hydrocarbons in crude oil, and different ones are used 
to make gasoline and diesel— which is why you can't use
them interchangeably. Fuels derived from crude oil
are extremely energy dense, bringing a lot of bang for your buck. Unfortunately, they have many drawbacks. Oil spills cause environmental damage
and cost billions of dollars to clean up. Air pollution from burning 
fossil fuels like these kills 4.5 million people each year. And transportation accounts for 16%
of global greenhouse gas emissions, almost half of which comes 
from passenger cars burning fossil fuels. These emissions warm the planet 
and make weather more extreme. In the U.S. alone,
storms caused by climate change caused $500 billion of damage 
in the last five years. So while gas is efficient, something so destructive
can't be the best fuel. The most common alternative
is electricity. Electric cars use a battery pack
and electric motor instead of the internal combustion engine
found in gas-powered cars, and must be charged at charging stations. With the right power infrastructure, they
can be as efficient as gas-powered cars. If powered by electricity generated
without fossil fuels, they can avoid greenhouse gas emissions 
entirely. They’re more expensive 
than gas-powered cars, but the cost difference has been
shrinking rapidly since 2010. The other alternatives to gasoline
are other liquid fuels. Many of these can be shipped and stored
using the same infrastructure as gasoline, and used in the same cars. They can also be carbon-neutral 
if they’re made using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere— meaning when we burn them, we release that
same carbon dioxide back into the air, and don't add to overall emissions. One approach to carbon-neutral fuel
is to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combine its carbon
with the hydrogen in water. This creates hydrocarbons, 
the source of energy in fossil fuels— but without any emissions if the fuels 
are made using clean electricity. These fuels take up more space than an energetically equivalent
amount of gasoline— an obstacle to using them in cars. Another approach is to make carbon-neutral
fuels from plants, which sequester carbon from the air 
through photosynthesis. But growing the plants also has 
to be carbon neutral— which rules out many crops
that require fertilizer, a big contributor 
to greenhouse gas emissions. So the next generation of these fuels
must be made from either plant waste or plants that don't require
fertilizer to grow. Biofuels can be about as efficient
as gasoline, though not all are. For a fuel to be the best option, 
people have to be able to afford it. Unfortunately, the high upfront costs
of implementing new technologies and heavy subsidies for the producers 
of fossil fuels, mean that almost every green technology is more expensive than 
its fossil-fuel-based cousin. This cost difference is known
as a green premium. Governments have already started
subsidizing electric vehicles to help make up the difference. In some places, depending 
on the costs of electricity and gas, electric cars can already
be cheaper overall, despite the higher cost of the car. The other alternatives are trickier, 
for now— zero-carbon liquid fuels can be
double the price of gasoline or more. Innovators are doing everything
they can to bring green premiums down, because in the end, the best fuel 
will be both affordable for consumers and sustainable for our planet.

**Transcript**:
Historically, most cars have run 
on gasoline, but that doesn’t have to be
the case in the future: other liquid fuels and electricity
can also power cars. So what are the differences 
between these options? And which one’s best? Gasoline is refined from crude oil, a fossil fuel extracted
from deep underground. The energy in gasoline comes from a class
of molecules called hydrocarbons. There are hundreds of different
hydrocarbons in crude oil, and different ones are used 
to make gasoline and diesel— which is why you can't use
them interchangeably. Fuels derived from crude oil
are extremely energy dense, bringing a lot of bang for your buck. Unfortunately, they have many drawbacks. Oil spills cause environmental damage
and cost billions of dollars to clean up. Air pollution from burning 
fossil fuels like these kills 4.5 million people each year. And transportation accounts for 16%
of global greenhouse gas emissions, almost half of which comes 
from passenger cars burning fossil fuels. These emissions warm the planet 
and make weather more extreme. In the U.S. alone,
storms caused by climate change caused $500 billion of damage 
in the last five years. So while gas is efficient, something so destructive
can't be the best fuel. The most common alternative
is electricity. Electric cars use a battery pack
and electric motor instead of the internal combustion engine
found in gas-powered cars, and must be charged at charging stations. With the right power infrastructure, they
can be as efficient as gas-powered cars. If powered by electricity generated
without fossil fuels, they can avoid greenhouse gas emissions 
entirely. They’re more expensive 
than gas-powered cars, but the cost difference has been
shrinking rapidly since 2010. The other alternatives to gasoline
are other liquid fuels. Many of these can be shipped and stored
using the same infrastructure as gasoline, and used in the same cars. They can also be carbon-neutral 
if they’re made using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere— meaning when we burn them, we release that
same carbon dioxide back into the air, and don't add to overall emissions. One approach to carbon-neutral fuel
is to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combine its carbon
with the hydrogen in water. This creates hydrocarbons, 
the source of energy in fossil fuels— but without any emissions if the fuels 
are made using clean electricity. These fuels take up more space than an energetically equivalent
amount of gasoline— an obstacle to using them in cars. Another approach is to make carbon-neutral
fuels from plants, which sequester carbon from the air 
through photosynthesis. But growing the plants also has 
to be carbon neutral— which rules out many crops
that require fertilizer, a big contributor 
to greenhouse gas emissions. So the next generation of these fuels
must be made from either plant waste or plants that don't require
fertilizer to grow. Biofuels can be about as efficient
as gasoline, though not all are. For a fuel to be the best option, 
people have to be able to afford it. Unfortunately, the high upfront costs
of implementing new technologies and heavy subsidies for the producers 
of fossil fuels, mean that almost every green technology is more expensive than 
its fossil-fuel-based cousin. This cost difference is known
as a green premium. Governments have already started
subsidizing electric vehicles to help make up the difference. In some places, depending 
on the costs of electricity and gas, electric cars can already
be cheaper overall, despite the higher cost of the car. The other alternatives are trickier, 
for now— zero-carbon liquid fuels can be
double the price of gasoline or more. Innovators are doing everything
they can to bring green premiums down, because in the end, the best fuel 
will be both affordable for consumers and sustainable for our planet.

**Transcript**:
No matter how we make electricity,
it takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines,
and plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,
facilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store 
the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines 
or solar panels. How much space depends
on the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt 
light bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce 
up to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized
chunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only
need an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least
0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly
7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— 
to power the bulb. When you consider the space needed 
to power cities, countries, and the whole world,
it adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts 
of electricity. To power the entire world 
with only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200
square kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost
four times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, 
a little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least
95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—
about the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability
in how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general
sense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure
in a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean 
are completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space 
they occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—
sometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency 
of the others. So, much of the land needed 
to generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space
still matters, because cities and other densely populated
areas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure 
works best when electricity is generated
where and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent
across long distances. Still, space demands are only
part of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity
comes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation 
is responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons 
of greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change 
and all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least
space of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases
and don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build
than solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered 
by fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel 
to generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places 
than others. No single approach will be
the best option to power the entire world while eliminating
harmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power
might be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., 
have the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity 
from renewables. And across the board, we should be working
to make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport 
in the case of renewables.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to determine if the amount of space needed to light a 10-watt light bulb depends on the power sources being used.

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between power sources and space requirements. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say Question 2 is the closest, but with a caveat that it doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
No matter how we make electricity,
it takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines,
and plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,
facilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store 
the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines 
or solar panels. How much space depends
on the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt 
light bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce 
up to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized
chunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only
need an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least
0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly
7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— 
to power the bulb. When you consider the space needed 
to power cities, countries, and the whole world,
it adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts 
of electricity. To power the entire world 
with only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200
square kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost
four times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, 
a little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least
95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—
about the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability
in how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general
sense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure
in a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean 
are completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space 
they occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—
sometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency 
of the others. So, much of the land needed 
to generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space
still matters, because cities and other densely populated
areas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure 
works best when electricity is generated
where and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent
across long distances. Still, space demands are only
part of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity
comes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation 
is responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons 
of greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change 
and all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least
space of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases
and don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build
than solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered 
by fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel 
to generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places 
than others. No single approach will be
the best option to power the entire world while eliminating
harmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power
might be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., 
have the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity 
from renewables. And across the board, we should be working
to make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport 
in the case of renewables.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the amount of electricity used by the world in 2020. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 6 asks about the percentage of electricity that comes from fossil fuels as of 2020. Although this question is not directly related to the total amount of electricity used, it does provide some information about the global electricity generation in 2020.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
As a breeze blows through the savannah, a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air
and scans the horizon like a periscope. But it’s not seeing— 
it’s sniffing for odors like the scent of a watering hole 
or the musk of a dangerous predator. The trunk’s owner 
is a young African elephant. At only 8 years old, she still has 
a lot to learn about her home. Fortunately, she’s not alone. Elephants are extremely social creatures, with females living in tight-knit herds 
led by a single matriarch. And every member of the group 
has one of the most versatile tools in the savannah to help them get by. Today her herd is looking for water. Or, more accurately, smelling for water. Elephants have more genes devoted 
to smell than any other creature, making them the best sniffers
in the animal kingdom. Even at our elephant’s young age,
her trunk is already 1.5 meters long and contains five times as many 
olfactory receptors as a human nose, allowing her to smell standing water
several kilometers away. And now, the matriarch uses her own keen
sense of smell to plot the herd’s course. Their journey is long,
so our elephant keeps her energy up by snacking on the occasional patch 
of thick grass. But this light lunch 
isn’t just about staying fed— she’s also looking for clues. Like many other mammals, vents in the roof of an elephant’s mouth 
lead directly to the vomeronasal organ. This structure can detect chemical
signals left by other elephants. So as the herd forages, 
they’re also gathering information about what other herds have come this way. All the while, the group’s adults are 
on the lookout for signs of other animals, including potential threats. Fortunately, while lions might attack
a young or sickly elephant, few are foolish enough to take 
on a healthy adult. Weighing 3 tons and bearing powerful tusks
nearly a meter long, our elephant’s mother is a force
to be reckoned with. Her dexterous trunk doubles 
as a powerful, flexible arm. Containing no bones
and an estimated 40,000 muscles, these agile appendages 
can bend, twist, contract, and expand. At 8 years old, our elephant’s trunk
is already strong enough to move small fallen trees, while finger-like extensions allow for 
delicate maneuvers like wiping her eye. She can even grab a nearby branch, break it to just the right length,
and wave off pesky insects. Suddenly, the matriarch stops their march
and sniffs the air. Using smell alone, elephants can recognize
each member of their herd, and their exceptional memories can 
retain the smells of elephants outside their herd as well. It’s one of these old but familiar odors
that’s caught the matriarch’s attention. She bellows into the air, sending out a sound wave 
that rings across the savannah. But it travels even further
through the earth as infrasonic rumbles. Elephants up to 10 kilometers away can
receive these rumbles with their feet. If the matriarch’s nose is right,
her herd should expect a response. Smelling the secretions 
from her daughter’s temporal glands, our elephant’s mother can sense 
her daughter’s unease about this unfamiliar encounter. As the herd of unknown
elephants approaches, trunks from both herds rise into the air,
sounding trumpets of alarm. But upon recognition, apprehension 
quickly gives way to happy rumbles. Members from each herd recognize
each other despite time apart, and many investigate each other’s mouths
with their trunks to smell what their counterparts 
have been eating. With the reunion now in full swing, both
herds head toward their final destination: the long-awaited watering hole. Here, older elephants suck up to 8 liters 
of water into their trunks before spraying the contents 
on themselves to cool off. Meanwhile, our young elephant plays 
in the mud with her peers, digging into the muck 
and even using her trunk as a snorkel to breathe while submerged. The pair of matriarchs look 
contentedly on their herds, before turning their trunks 
to the horizon once more.

**Transcript**:
As a breeze blows through the savannah, a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air
and scans the horizon like a periscope. But it’s not seeing— 
it’s sniffing for odors like the scent of a watering hole 
or the musk of a dangerous predator. The trunk’s owner 
is a young African elephant. At only 8 years old, she still has 
a lot to learn about her home. Fortunately, she’s not alone. Elephants are extremely social creatures, with females living in tight-knit herds 
led by a single matriarch. And every member of the group 
has one of the most versatile tools in the savannah to help them get by. Today her herd is looking for water. Or, more accurately, smelling for water. Elephants have more genes devoted 
to smell than any other creature, making them the best sniffers
in the animal kingdom. Even at our elephant’s young age,
her trunk is already 1.5 meters long and contains five times as many 
olfactory receptors as a human nose, allowing her to smell standing water
several kilometers away. And now, the matriarch uses her own keen
sense of smell to plot the herd’s course. Their journey is long,
so our elephant keeps her energy up by snacking on the occasional patch 
of thick grass. But this light lunch 
isn’t just about staying fed— she’s also looking for clues. Like many other mammals, vents in the roof of an elephant’s mouth 
lead directly to the vomeronasal organ. This structure can detect chemical
signals left by other elephants. So as the herd forages, 
they’re also gathering information about what other herds have come this way. All the while, the group’s adults are 
on the lookout for signs of other animals, including potential threats. Fortunately, while lions might attack
a young or sickly elephant, few are foolish enough to take 
on a healthy adult. Weighing 3 tons and bearing powerful tusks
nearly a meter long, our elephant’s mother is a force
to be reckoned with. Her dexterous trunk doubles 
as a powerful, flexible arm. Containing no bones
and an estimated 40,000 muscles, these agile appendages 
can bend, twist, contract, and expand. At 8 years old, our elephant’s trunk
is already strong enough to move small fallen trees, while finger-like extensions allow for 
delicate maneuvers like wiping her eye. She can even grab a nearby branch, break it to just the right length,
and wave off pesky insects. Suddenly, the matriarch stops their march
and sniffs the air. Using smell alone, elephants can recognize
each member of their herd, and their exceptional memories can 
retain the smells of elephants outside their herd as well. It’s one of these old but familiar odors
that’s caught the matriarch’s attention. She bellows into the air, sending out a sound wave 
that rings across the savannah. But it travels even further
through the earth as infrasonic rumbles. Elephants up to 10 kilometers away can
receive these rumbles with their feet. If the matriarch’s nose is right,
her herd should expect a response. Smelling the secretions 
from her daughter’s temporal glands, our elephant’s mother can sense 
her daughter’s unease about this unfamiliar encounter. As the herd of unknown
elephants approaches, trunks from both herds rise into the air,
sounding trumpets of alarm. But upon recognition, apprehension 
quickly gives way to happy rumbles. Members from each herd recognize
each other despite time apart, and many investigate each other’s mouths
with their trunks to smell what their counterparts 
have been eating. With the reunion now in full swing, both
herds head toward their final destination: the long-awaited watering hole. Here, older elephants suck up to 8 liters 
of water into their trunks before spraying the contents 
on themselves to cool off. Meanwhile, our young elephant plays 
in the mud with her peers, digging into the muck 
and even using her trunk as a snorkel to breathe while submerged. The pair of matriarchs look 
contentedly on their herds, before turning their trunks 
to the horizon once more.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: What is special about an elephant's trunk? Options: A. It is very short and stumpy., B. It is very long and contains many olfactory receptors., C. It is very heavy and difficult to move., D. It is very thin and fragile.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about the uses of an elephant's trunk. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the functions or uses of an elephant's trunk.

A closer match can be inferred from Question 2, but since none of the generated MCQs directly ask which option is NOT a use of an elephant's trunk, I will choose the closest related question.

A better approach would be to create a new question that directly asks which of the options is NOT a use of an elephant's trunk, with options similar to the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would choose Question 2 as the most similar, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5: How do elephants recognize each other? 

Although this question does not directly ask about the social structure of female elephants, it does touch on the topic of recognition and social interaction among elephants, which is related to the concept of a matriarch-led social group.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be one that directly asks about the social structure of female elephants. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs match this intent.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but it's still not a direct match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: How do elephants recognize each other? Options: A. By their visual appearance., B. By their unique sounds., C. By their distinctive smells., D. By their body language.**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only addresses the aspect of recognition by smell, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about detecting the presence of other elephants besides odors.

A closer match is:

**Question 7: How do elephants communicate with each other over long distances? Options: A. By using a complex system of clicks and whistles., B. By using a variety of visual signals., C. By sending out infrasonic rumbles through the earth., D. By using a network of underground tunnels.**

This question addresses the aspect of detecting vibrations with their feet, which is mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

However, the most similar generated MCQ that addresses both aspects of the ground truth MCQ (hearing with their ears and detecting vibrations with their feet) is not present. But if I had to choose one, I would choose:

**Question 7**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs do not exactly replicate the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Once each year, thousands of logicians
descend into the desert for Learning Man, a week-long event they attend
to share their ideas, think through tough problems...
and mostly to party. And at the center of that gathering 
is the world’s most exclusive club, where under the full moon, 
the annual logician’s rave takes place. The entry is guarded 
by the Demon of Reason, and the only way to get in is to solve
one of his dastardly challenges. You’re attending with 23 
of your closest logician friends, but you got lost on the way 
to the rave and arrived late. They're already inside, so you must
face down the demon alone. He poses you the following question: When your friends arrived,
the demon put masks on their faces and forbade them from communicating
in any way. No one at any point could
see their own masks, but they stood in a circle where they
could see everyone else’s. The demon told the logicians that he 
distributed the masks in such a way that each person would eventually be able 
to figure out their mask’s color using logic alone. Then, once every two minutes,
he rang a bell. At that point, anyone who could
come to him and tell him the color of their mask 
would be admitted. Here’s what happened: Four logicians got in at the first bell. Some number of logicians, all in red 
masks, got in at the second bell. Nobody got in when the third bell rang. Logicians wearing at least two different
colors got in at the fourth bell. All 23 of your friends played 
the game perfectly logically and eventually got inside. Your challenge, the demon explains, is to tell him how many people gained
entry when the fifth bell rang. Can you get into the rave? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s initially difficult to imagine 
how anyone could, using just logic and the colors
they see on the other masks, deduce their own mask color. But even before the first bell, everyone
will realize something critical. Let’s imagine a single logician
with a silver mask. When she looks around, she’d see 
multiple colors, but no silver. So she couldn’t ever know that silver 
is an option, making it impossible for her to logically 
deduce that she must be silver. That contradicts rule five, so there must
be at least two masks of each color. Now, let’s think about what happens when there are exactly two people wearing 
the same color mask. Each of them sees only one mask 
of that color. But because they already know 
that it can’t be the only one, they immediately know that their own mask 
is the other. This must be what happened
before the first bell: two pairs of logicians each realized
their own mask colors when they saw a unique color in the room. What happens if there are three people 
wearing the same color? Each of them—A, B and C—
sees two people with that color. From A’s perspective, B and C would be
expected to behave the same way that the orange and purple pairs did, 
leaving at the first bell. When that doesn’t happen, each of the three realizes that they are 
the third person with that color, and all three leave at the next bell. That was what the people 
with red masks did— so there must have been three of them. We’ve now established a basis 
for inductive reasoning. Induction is where we can solve 
the simplest case, then find a pattern that will allow 
the same reasoning to apply 
to successively larger sets. The pattern here is that everyone 
will know what group they’re in as soon as the previously sized group
has the opportunity to leave. After the second bell, 
there were 16 people. No one left on the third bell, so everyone then knew there weren’t 
any groups of four. Multiple groups,
which must have been of five, left on the fourth bell. Three groups would
leave a solitary mask wearer, which isn’t possible, 
so it must’ve been two groups. And that leaves six logicians outside 
when the fifth bell rings: the answer to the demon’s riddle. Nothing left to do but join your friends 
and dance.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of logic and reasoning.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the scenario where there are only two red masks and four green masks, and when the reds gain entry. This is related to the pattern of inductive reasoning used by the logicians to figure out their mask colors.

The closest generated MCQ that I can find is Question 6: How many logicians gained entry to the club at the first bell? Options: A. 2, B. 4, C. 6, D. 8. This question is related to the same scenario, but it's asking about the number of logicians who gained entry at the first bell, not specifically about the red masks.

However, based on the explanation in the transcript, we know that if there are only two red masks, they will gain entry at the first bell. So, the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ is A. the first bell.

Therefore, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match to the ground truth MCQ, but it's not an exact match.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of logic and reasoning.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the scenario where there are only two red masks and four green masks, and when the greens gain entry. This requires the application of the inductive reasoning pattern explained in the transcript.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest in terms of logic and reasoning. It asks why no one gained entry to the club at the third bell, and the correct answer is because there were no groups of four. This question requires the application of the same inductive reasoning pattern as the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that Question 9 is not a direct match to the ground truth MCQ, and it does not ask about the scenario with two red masks and four green masks.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low confidence level.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the scenario where there are only three red masks and four green masks, and when the reds gain entry. The correct answer is the second bell.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the most similar, as it asks about the color of the masks worn by the logicians who gained entry at the second bell. Although it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same scenario and has a similar intent.

However, I must note that Question 7 does not have the same options as the ground truth MCQ, and it does not ask about the specific scenario of three red masks and four green masks.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 7, but with the caveat that it is not an exact match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of logic and reasoning.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the scenario where there are only three red masks and four green masks, and when the greens gain entry. This requires the application of the inductive reasoning pattern established in the transcript.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest in terms of logic and reasoning. It asks why no one gained entry to the club at the third bell, and the correct answer is because there were no groups of four. This question requires the application of the same inductive reasoning pattern as the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that Question 9 is not a direct match to the ground truth MCQ, and it does not ask about the scenario with three red masks and four green masks.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Once each year, thousands of logicians
descend into the desert for Learning Man, a week-long event they attend
to share their ideas, think through tough problems...
and mostly to party. And at the center of that gathering 
is the world’s most exclusive club, where under the full moon, 
the annual logician’s rave takes place. The entry is guarded 
by the Demon of Reason, and the only way to get in is to solve
one of his dastardly challenges. You’re attending with 23 
of your closest logician friends, but you got lost on the way 
to the rave and arrived late. They're already inside, so you must
face down the demon alone. He poses you the following question: When your friends arrived,
the demon put masks on their faces and forbade them from communicating
in any way. No one at any point could
see their own masks, but they stood in a circle where they
could see everyone else’s. The demon told the logicians that he 
distributed the masks in such a way that each person would eventually be able 
to figure out their mask’s color using logic alone. Then, once every two minutes,
he rang a bell. At that point, anyone who could
come to him and tell him the color of their mask 
would be admitted. Here’s what happened: Four logicians got in at the first bell. Some number of logicians, all in red 
masks, got in at the second bell. Nobody got in when the third bell rang. Logicians wearing at least two different
colors got in at the fourth bell. All 23 of your friends played 
the game perfectly logically and eventually got inside. Your challenge, the demon explains, is to tell him how many people gained
entry when the fifth bell rang. Can you get into the rave? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s initially difficult to imagine 
how anyone could, using just logic and the colors
they see on the other masks, deduce their own mask color. But even before the first bell, everyone
will realize something critical. Let’s imagine a single logician
with a silver mask. When she looks around, she’d see 
multiple colors, but no silver. So she couldn’t ever know that silver 
is an option, making it impossible for her to logically 
deduce that she must be silver. That contradicts rule five, so there must
be at least two masks of each color. Now, let’s think about what happens when there are exactly two people wearing 
the same color mask. Each of them sees only one mask 
of that color. But because they already know 
that it can’t be the only one, they immediately know that their own mask 
is the other. This must be what happened
before the first bell: two pairs of logicians each realized
their own mask colors when they saw a unique color in the room. What happens if there are three people 
wearing the same color? Each of them—A, B and C—
sees two people with that color. From A’s perspective, B and C would be
expected to behave the same way that the orange and purple pairs did, 
leaving at the first bell. When that doesn’t happen, each of the three realizes that they are 
the third person with that color, and all three leave at the next bell. That was what the people 
with red masks did— so there must have been three of them. We’ve now established a basis 
for inductive reasoning. Induction is where we can solve 
the simplest case, then find a pattern that will allow 
the same reasoning to apply 
to successively larger sets. The pattern here is that everyone 
will know what group they’re in as soon as the previously sized group
has the opportunity to leave. After the second bell, 
there were 16 people. No one left on the third bell, so everyone then knew there weren’t 
any groups of four. Multiple groups,
which must have been of five, left on the fourth bell. Three groups would
leave a solitary mask wearer, which isn’t possible, 
so it must’ve been two groups. And that leaves six logicians outside 
when the fifth bell rings: the answer to the demon’s riddle. Nothing left to do but join your friends 
and dance.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of logic and pattern.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the timing of when a specific group of logicians (the greens) gain entry, given a certain distribution of mask colors.

The closest generated MCQ that I can find is Question 9: "Why did no one gain entry to the club at the third bell?" Options: A. Because no one had figured out their mask color, B. Because everyone had already gained entry, C. Because there were no groups of four, D. Because the bell didn't ring.

Although this question is not directly asking about when a specific group gains entry, it is related to the pattern of how logicians gain entry based on the distribution of mask colors. The correct answer, "Because there were no groups of four", implies that the logicians are using inductive reasoning to figure out their mask colors, which is similar to the logic used in the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that this is a weak match, and none of the generated MCQs truly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Here in this abundant forest, Malassezia is equipped with everything 
it could ever need. Feasting constantly, it’s in paradise. But wait— what’s this? In fact, Malassezia is a type of yeast 
that lives and dines on all of our scalps. And in about half of the human population,
its activity causes dandruff. So, why do some people have
more dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? We might consider ourselves individuals,
but we’re really colonies. Our skin hosts billions of microbes. Malassezia yeasts make themselves at home
on our skin shortly after we’re born. Follicles, the tiny cavities that grow
hairs all over our body, make for especially popular 
living quarters. Malassezia are fond of these hideouts
because they contain glands that secrete an oil called sebum that’s thought to lubricate 
and strengthen our hair. Malassezia evolved to consume 
our skin’s proteins and oils. And because of its many sebum-secreting 
follicles, our scalp is one of the oiliest places
on our body— and consequently, one of the yeastiest. As these fungi feast on our scalp’s oils,
dandruff may form. This is because sebum is composed of both
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fats neatly pack together. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, contain double bonds that create 
an irregular kink in their structure. Malassezia eat sebum by secreting
an enzyme that releases all of the oil’s 
fatty acids. But they only consume the saturated fats,
leaving the unsaturated ones behind. These irregularly shaped leftovers 
soak into the skin and pry its barrier open,
allowing water to escape. The body detects these breaches 
and responds defensively, causing the inflammation 
that gives dandruff it’s itch. It also makes the skin cells proliferate
to repair the damaged barrier. Usually, our skin’s outer surface, 
or epidermis, completely renews itself 
every two to three weeks, Epidermal cells divide, 
move outwards, die, and form the skin’s tough outer layer, which gradually sheds off in single cells 
far too small to see. But with dandruff, cells churn out quickly
to correct the broken barrier, meaning they don’t mature 
and differentiate properly. Instead, they form large, greasy clumps
around the hair follicle that are shed as visible flakes. This is how Malassezia’s 
voracious appetite and our bodies reaction 
to its by-products lead to dandruff. Currently, the most effective way to get
rid of dandruff is by using antifungals 
in things like shampoos, applied directly to the scalp, 
to kill Malassezia. For those who experience dandruff, it usually comes and goes as sebum
secretions vary throughout one's lifetime due to hormonal changes. But despite the fact that Malassezia 
colonize everyone to a similar extent, not everyone gets dandruff. Some people are more susceptible. Exactly why is unclear. Do people with dandruff have a certain 
genetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating 
if people with dandruff do, in fact, lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what’s leading 
their skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that Malassezia
communicate with our immune system using small, oily molecules called 
oxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit
inflammatory oxylipins and boost anti-inflammatory ones, 
they could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating 
if there’s any benefit to our relationship with Malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable
and embarrassing for us, creates a reliable, oily 
food source for the yeast. But dandruff isn’t contagious 
or a great threat to our health. And Malassezia seem to excel
at defending their territory, our skin, from other, more harmful microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus. So, while scientists have gotten 
to the bottom of many mysteries surrounding this condition,
it must be said: dandruff remains a head-scratcher.

that lives and dines on all of our scalps. And in about half of the human population,
its activity causes dandruff. So, why do some people have
more dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? We might consider ourselves individuals,
but we’re really colonies. Our skin hosts billions of microbes. Malassezia yeasts make themselves at home
on our skin shortly after we’re born. Follicles, the tiny cavities that grow
hairs all over our body, make for especially popular 
living quarters. Malassezia are fond of these hideouts
because they contain glands that secrete an oil called sebum that’s thought to lubricate 
and strengthen our hair. Malassezia evolved to consume 
our skin’s proteins and oils. And because of its many sebum-secreting 
follicles, our scalp is one of the oiliest places
on our body— and consequently, one of the yeastiest. As these fungi feast on our scalp’s oils,
dandruff may form. This is because sebum is composed of both
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fats neatly pack together. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, contain double bonds that create 
an irregular kink in their structure. Malassezia eat sebum by secreting
an enzyme that releases all of the oil’s 
fatty acids. But they only consume the saturated fats,
leaving the unsaturated ones behind. These irregularly shaped leftovers 
soak into the skin and pry its barrier open,
allowing water to escape. The body detects these breaches 
and responds defensively, causing the inflammation 
that gives dandruff it’s itch. It also makes the skin cells proliferate
to repair the damaged barrier. Usually, our skin’s outer surface, 
or epidermis, completely renews itself 
every two to three weeks, Epidermal cells divide, 
move outwards, die, and form the skin’s tough outer layer, which gradually sheds off in single cells 
far too small to see. But with dandruff, cells churn out quickly
to correct the broken barrier, meaning they don’t mature 
and differentiate properly. Instead, they form large, greasy clumps
around the hair follicle that are shed as visible flakes. This is how Malassezia’s 
voracious appetite and our bodies reaction 
to its by-products lead to dandruff. Currently, the most effective way to get
rid of dandruff is by using antifungals 
in things like shampoos, applied directly to the scalp, 
to kill Malassezia. For those who experience dandruff, it usually comes and goes as sebum
secretions vary throughout one's lifetime due to hormonal changes. But despite the fact that Malassezia 
colonize everyone to a similar extent, not everyone gets dandruff. Some people are more susceptible. Exactly why is unclear. Do people with dandruff have a certain 
genetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating 
if people with dandruff do, in fact, lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what’s leading 
their skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that Malassezia
communicate with our immune system using small, oily molecules called 
oxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit
inflammatory oxylipins and boost anti-inflammatory ones, 
they could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating 
if there’s any benefit to our relationship with Malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable
and embarrassing for us, creates a reliable, oily 
food source for the yeast. But dandruff isn’t contagious 
or a great threat to our health. And Malassezia seem to excel
at defending their territory, our skin, from other, more harmful microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus. So, while scientists have gotten 
to the bottom of many mysteries surrounding this condition,
it must be said: dandruff remains a head-scratcher.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1860s, scientists believed
they were on the verge of uncovering the brain’s biggest secret. They already knew the brain controlled
the body through electrical impulses. The question was, how did these signals
travel through the body without changing or degrading? It seemed that perfectly transmitting 
these impulses would require them to travel uninterrupted
along some kind of tissue. This idea, called reticular theory, imagined the nervous system 
as a massive web of tissue that physically connected 
every nerve cell in the body. Reticular theory captivated the field
with its elegant simplicity. But soon, a young artist would cut through
this conjecture, and sketch a bold new vision 
of how our brains work. 60 years before reticular theory was born, developments in microscope technology revealed cells to be the building blocks 
of organic tissue. This finding was revolutionary, but early microscopes struggled
to provide additional details. The technology was especially challenging
for researchers studying the brain. Soft nervous tissue was
delicate and difficult to work with. And even when researchers were able
to get it under the microscope, the tissue was so densely packed 
it was impossible to see much. To improve their view, scientists began experimenting 
with special staining techniques designed to provide clarity 
through contrast. The most effective came courtesy
of Camillo Golgi in 1873. First, Golgi hardened the brain tissue 
with potassium bichromate to prevent cells from deforming 
during handling. Then he doused the tissue 
in silver nitrate, which visibly accumulated in nerve cells. Known as the “black reaction,” Golgi’s Method finally allowed researchers
to see the entire cell body of what would later be named the neuron. The stain even highlighted 
the fibrous branches that shot off from the cell 
in different directions. Images of these branches
became hazy at the ends, making it difficult to determine exactly
how they fit into the larger network. But Golgi concluded that these
branches connected, forming a web of tissue comprising
the entire nervous system. 14 years later, a young scientist
and aspiring artist named Santiago Ramón y Cajal 
began to build on Golgi’s work. While writing a book 
about microscopic imaging, he came across a picture of a cell
treated with Golgi’s stain. Cajal was in awe of its exquisite detail—
both as a scientist and an artist. He soon set out to improve
Golgi’s stain even further and create more detailed references
for his artwork. By staining the tissue twice
in a specific time frame, Cajal found he could stain a greater
number of neurons with better resolution. And what these new slides revealed
would upend reticular theory— the branches reaching out 
from each nerve cell were not physically connected 
to any other tissue. So how were these individual cells 
transmitting electrical signals? By studying and sketching
them countless times, Cajal developed a bold, new hypothesis. Instead of electrical signals traveling
uninterrupted across a network of fibers, he proposed that signals were somehow
jumping from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation. The idea that electrical signals could
travel this way was completely unheard of when Cajal proposed it in 1889. However his massive collection of drawings
supported his hypothesis from every angle. And in the mid-1900s, electron microscopy
further supported this idea by revealing a membrane 
around each nerve cell keeping it separate from its neighbors. This formed the basis 
of the “neuron doctrine,” which proposed the brain’s tissue 
was made up of many discrete cells, instead of one connected tissue. The neuron doctrine laid the foundation 
for modern neuroscience, and allowed later researchers to discover 
that electrical impulses are constantly converted between
chemical and electrical signals as they travel from neuron to neuron. Both Golgi and Cajal received 
the Nobel Prize for their separate, 
but shared discoveries, and researchers still apply 
their theories and methods today. In this way, their legacies remain
connected as discrete elements in a vast network of knowledge.

with potassium bichromate to prevent cells from deforming 
during handling. Then he doused the tissue 
in silver nitrate, which visibly accumulated in nerve cells. Known as the “black reaction,” Golgi’s Method finally allowed researchers
to see the entire cell body of what would later be named the neuron. The stain even highlighted 
the fibrous branches that shot off from the cell 
in different directions. Images of these branches
became hazy at the ends, making it difficult to determine exactly
how they fit into the larger network. But Golgi concluded that these
branches connected, forming a web of tissue comprising
the entire nervous system. 14 years later, a young scientist
and aspiring artist named Santiago Ramón y Cajal 
began to build on Golgi’s work. While writing a book 
about microscopic imaging, he came across a picture of a cell
treated with Golgi’s stain. Cajal was in awe of its exquisite detail—
both as a scientist and an artist. He soon set out to improve
Golgi’s stain even further and create more detailed references
for his artwork. By staining the tissue twice
in a specific time frame, Cajal found he could stain a greater
number of neurons with better resolution. And what these new slides revealed
would upend reticular theory— the branches reaching out 
from each nerve cell were not physically connected 
to any other tissue. So how were these individual cells 
transmitting electrical signals? By studying and sketching
them countless times, Cajal developed a bold, new hypothesis. Instead of electrical signals traveling
uninterrupted across a network of fibers, he proposed that signals were somehow
jumping from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation. The idea that electrical signals could
travel this way was completely unheard of when Cajal proposed it in 1889. However his massive collection of drawings
supported his hypothesis from every angle. And in the mid-1900s, electron microscopy
further supported this idea by revealing a membrane 
around each nerve cell keeping it separate from its neighbors. This formed the basis 
of the “neuron doctrine,” which proposed the brain’s tissue 
was made up of many discrete cells, instead of one connected tissue. The neuron doctrine laid the foundation 
for modern neuroscience, and allowed later researchers to discover 
that electrical impulses are constantly converted between
chemical and electrical signals as they travel from neuron to neuron. Both Golgi and Cajal received 
the Nobel Prize for their separate, 
but shared discoveries, and researchers still apply 
their theories and methods today. In this way, their legacies remain
connected as discrete elements in a vast network of knowledge.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1860s, scientists believed
they were on the verge of uncovering the brain’s biggest secret. They already knew the brain controlled
the body through electrical impulses. The question was, how did these signals
travel through the body without changing or degrading? It seemed that perfectly transmitting 
these impulses would require them to travel uninterrupted
along some kind of tissue. This idea, called reticular theory, imagined the nervous system 
as a massive web of tissue that physically connected 
every nerve cell in the body. Reticular theory captivated the field
with its elegant simplicity. But soon, a young artist would cut through
this conjecture, and sketch a bold new vision 
of how our brains work. 60 years before reticular theory was born, developments in microscope technology revealed cells to be the building blocks 
of organic tissue. This finding was revolutionary, but early microscopes struggled
to provide additional details. The technology was especially challenging
for researchers studying the brain. Soft nervous tissue was
delicate and difficult to work with. And even when researchers were able
to get it under the microscope, the tissue was so densely packed 
it was impossible to see much. To improve their view, scientists began experimenting 
with special staining techniques designed to provide clarity 
through contrast. The most effective came courtesy
of Camillo Golgi in 1873. First, Golgi hardened the brain tissue

**Transcript**:
In 1984, two field workers discovered 
a body in a bog outside Cheshire, England. Officials named the body the Lindow Man and determined that he’d suffered 
serious injuries, including blunt trauma and strangulation. But the most shocking thing 
about this gruesome story was that they were able to determine these
details from a body over 2,000 years old. Typically, decomposition would make
such injuries hard to detect on a body buried just weeks earlier. So why was this corpse 
so perfectly preserved? And why don't all bodies
stay in this condition? The answers to these questions
live six feet underground. It may not appear very lively down here, but a single teaspoon of soil 
contains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae 
to fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth’s
biodiversity. And perhaps the soil’s most important 
inhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger 
than several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet’s 
dead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin
breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume
and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition
sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present
depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields
there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down 
grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest 
there are more fungi, capable of breaking down 
complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food
from the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction
called oxidation. This breaks down the molecules 
of organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients 
in a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon
and some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, 
sulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat
more of the apple, they expose more surface area 
for these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind
are mined by microbes. This continues until the apple
is reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two
months in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet 
support more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things
more quickly. And less complex organic materials 
break down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced 
to microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules
are too strong to break down any further. So instead, 
these nutrients feed plant life, which grow more food that will
eventually decompose. This constant cycle of creating and 
decomposing supports all life on Earth. But there are a few environments too
hostile for these multi-talented microbes— including the peat bogs 
outside Cheshire, England. Peat bogs are mostly made of highly
acidic Sphagnum mosses. These plants acidify the soil
while also releasing a compound that binds to nitrogen, 
depriving the area of nutrients. Alongside cold 
northern European temperatures, these conditions make it impossible 
for most microbes to function. With nothing to break them down, the dead mosses pile up, 
preventing oxygen from entering the bog. The result is a naturally sealed system. Whatever organic matter enters a peat bog
just sits there— like the Lindow Man. The acid of the bog was strong enough to dissolve relatively simple material 
like bone, and it turned more complex tissue 
like skin and organs pitch black. But his corpse is otherwise 
so well-preserved, that we can determine 
he was healthy, mid-20s, and potentially wealthy 
as his body shows few signs of hard labor. We even know the Lindow Man’s last meal— a still undigested piece of charred bread. Scholars are less certain about 
the circumstances of his death. While cold-blooded murder
is a possibility, the extremity of his injuries
suggest a ritual sacrifice. Even 2,000 years ago, there’s evidence the bog was known 
for its almost supernatural qualities; a place where the soil beneath your feet 
wasn’t quite dead or alive.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of global biodiversity that soil is home to. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions the role of microbes in the decomposition process and the fact that soils are home to a diverse range of organisms.

However, a more relevant question is not available. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

A more suitable answer would be "No matching question available."

contains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae 
to fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth’s
biodiversity. And perhaps the soil’s most important 
inhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger 
than several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet’s 
dead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin
breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume
and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition
sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present
depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields
there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down 
grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest 
there are more fungi, capable of breaking down 
complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food
from the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction
called oxidation. This breaks down the molecules 
of organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients 
in a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon
and some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, 
sulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat
more of the apple, they expose more surface area 
for these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind
are mined by microbes. This continues until the apple
is reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two
months in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet 
support more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things
more quickly. And less complex organic materials 
break down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced 
to microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules
are too strong to break down any further. So instead, 
these nutrients feed plant life, which grow more food that will
eventually decompose. This constant cycle of creating and 
decomposing supports all life on Earth. But there are a few environments too
hostile for these multi-talented microbes— including the peat bogs 
outside Cheshire, England. Peat bogs are mostly made of highly
acidic Sphagnum mosses. These plants acidify the soil
while also releasing a compound that binds to nitrogen, 
depriving the area of nutrients. Alongside cold 
northern European temperatures, these conditions make it impossible 
for most microbes to function. With nothing to break them down, the dead mosses pile up, 
preventing oxygen from entering the bog. The result is a naturally sealed system. Whatever organic matter enters a peat bog
just sits there— like the Lindow Man. The acid of the bog was strong enough to dissolve relatively simple material 
like bone, and it turned more complex tissue 
like skin and organs pitch black. But his corpse is otherwise 
so well-preserved, that we can determine 
he was healthy, mid-20s, and potentially wealthy 
as his body shows few signs of hard labor. We even know the Lindow Man’s last meal— a still undigested piece of charred bread. Scholars are less certain about 
the circumstances of his death. While cold-blooded murder
is a possibility, the extremity of his injuries
suggest a ritual sacrifice. Even 2,000 years ago, there’s evidence the bog was known 
for its almost supernatural qualities; a place where the soil beneath your feet 
wasn’t quite dead or alive.

disruptions, worldwide. The next people affected are those
traveling by air, sea, or land, as global positioning, navigation 
and timing services, have entirely ceased. Pilots, captains, and drivers 
have to determine their locations using analog instruments and maps. Aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles get 
stopped, grounded, or returned to port. In the meantime, air traffic controllers
have a difficult task on their hands to prevent plane crashes. Within hours, most of the planet’s traffic
grinds to a halt. The effects aren’t limited 
to entertainment and travel. All sorts of machines, from heating 
and cooling systems to assembly lines, rely on super-accurate 
satellite-based timing systems, and many have little-to-no backup options. Stoplights and other traffic control
systems stop synchronizing, so police and good Samaritans

goods like food and medicine fragment, leaving people to survive on whatever
is locally available. Most countries declare 
a state of emergency and call on the military to restore order. That may take quite a while. Most navigation and communication systems
are no longer operational, so military chains of command

of a hostile attack. What sorts of decisions do they make 
with partial information? Even in the best-case scenario, our civilization gets set back by decades 
at the very least. That’s because, despite
being a relatively new phenomenon, satellites have quickly replaced more
traditional long range technologies. The combination of global positioning
and internet has allowed for near-instant signals 
that can be synchronized worldwide. Many systems we use daily 
have been built upon this foundation. Going back to the communication systems
of the mid-20th century would not be a simple matter. In many cases, they’d have to be rebuilt
from the ground up. While the sudden disappearance 
in this thought experiment is unlikely, there are two very real scenarios 
that could lead to the same results. The first is a solar flare so strong
it fries satellite circuitry– as well as many other devices 
and power grids around the world. And the second is an orbital chain
reaction of collisions. With about 7,500 metric tons 
of defunct spacecraft, spent boosters, and discarded equipment 
orbiting our planet at relative speeds 
up to 56,000 kilometers per hour, even small objects can be
highly destructive. A single collision in space could create
thousands of new pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction. Space is huge, but many of the thousands
of satellites currently in orbit share the same orbital highways 
for their specific purposes. And since most objects sent to space 
are not designed with disposal in mind, these highways only become
more congested over time. The good news is, we can protect ourselves
by studying our solar system, creating backup options 
for our satellite networks, and cooperating to avoid 
an orbital tragedy of the commons. The space kilometers above our heads
is like our forests, the ocean’s biodiversity and clean air: If we don't treat it as a finite resource, we may wake up one day to find
we no longer have it at all.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the functionality of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in the event of a sudden disappearance of all artificial satellites. The correct answer is "C. Depends," indicating that the functionality of ATMs would depend on various factors, such as their reliance on satellite-based timing systems and backup options.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most relevant, as it discusses the reliance of various systems, including those with "little-to-no backup options," on satellite-based timing systems. However, it does not explicitly mention ATMs.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest creating a new generated MCQ that explicitly addresses the functionality of ATMs in the event of a sudden disappearance of all artificial satellites.

Example of a new generated MCQ:
Question: Would Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) still work if all artificial satellites suddenly disappeared?
Options: A. Yes, B. No, C. Depends
Correct Option: C

This new generated MCQ more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

to process what’s happened, millions sitting on their couches become
aware that something is amiss. TV that’s broadcast from or routed 
through satellites dominate the market for international programming 
as well as some local channels, so the disappearance causes immediate
disruptions, worldwide. The next people affected are those
traveling by air, sea, or land, as global positioning, navigation 
and timing services, have entirely ceased. Pilots, captains, and drivers 
have to determine their locations using analog instruments and maps. Aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles get 
stopped, grounded, or returned to port. In the meantime, air traffic controllers
have a difficult task on their hands to prevent plane crashes. Within hours, most of the planet’s traffic
grinds to a halt. The effects aren’t limited 
to entertainment and travel. All sorts of machines, from heating 
and cooling systems to assembly lines, rely on super-accurate 
satellite-based timing systems, and many have little-to-no backup options. Stoplights and other traffic control
systems stop synchronizing, so police and good Samaritans 
step in to direct the remaining cars and prevent as many accidents as possible. The most catastrophic impact 
is yet to come. Because in the next few hours, 
the world economy shuts down. Satellite-based timestamps 
play a critical part in everything from credit card readers 
and stock exchanges to the systems that keep track
of transactions. People are unable to withdraw cash
or make electronic payments. Logistics and supply chains for crucial
goods like food and medicine fragment, leaving people to survive on whatever
is locally available. Most countries declare 
a state of emergency and call on the military to restore order. That may take quite a while. Most navigation and communication systems
are no longer operational, so military chains of command
may be in disarray. Many troops, including those actively
deployed, are left to their own devices. Commanders of nuclear submarines 
and missile control centers wonder if the disruption is the result
of a hostile attack. What sorts of decisions do they make 
with partial information? Even in the best-case scenario, our civilization gets set back by decades 
at the very least. That’s because, despite
being a relatively new phenomenon, satellites have quickly replaced more
traditional long range technologies. The combination of global positioning
and internet has allowed for near-instant signals 
that can be synchronized worldwide. Many systems we use daily 
have been built upon this foundation. Going back to the communication systems
of the mid-20th century would not be a simple matter. In many cases, they’d have to be rebuilt
from the ground up. While the sudden disappearance 
in this thought experiment is unlikely, there are two very real scenarios 
that could lead to the same results. The first is a solar flare so strong
it fries satellite circuitry– as well as many other devices 
and power grids around the world. And the second is an orbital chain
reaction of collisions. With about 7,500 metric tons 
of defunct spacecraft, spent boosters, and discarded equipment 
orbiting our planet at relative speeds 
up to 56,000 kilometers per hour, even small objects can be
highly destructive. A single collision in space could create
thousands of new pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction. Space is huge, but many of the thousands
of satellites currently in orbit share the same orbital highways 
for their specific purposes. And since most objects sent to space 
are not designed with disposal in mind, these highways only become
more congested over time. The good news is, we can protect ourselves
by studying our solar system, creating backup options 
for our satellite networks, and cooperating to avoid 
an orbital tragedy of the commons. The space kilometers above our heads
is like our forests, the ocean’s biodiversity and clean air: If we don't treat it as a finite resource, we may wake up one day to find
we no longer have it at all.

**Transcript**:
The earliest known divorce
laws were written on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia
around 2000 BCE. Formally or informally, human societies 
across place and time have made rules 
to bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,
started with a trial partnership, during which a man could send 
his partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,
there was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, 
divorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners
with a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,
and why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some
of society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,
individual rights, and women’s rights. Religious authorities have often
regulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife 
without cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s
agreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled
divorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church
banning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing
it in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. In the late 18th century,
a series of changes took place that would eventually shape 
divorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance
separate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over
education, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first
of the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce 
for a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, 
and desertion, or simply mutual consent. Though progress was uneven, overall this
sort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European
colonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often
remained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more
serious for women— a man could divorce his wife
for adultery alone, while a woman would need
evidence of adultery, plus an additional offense
to divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard
was written into law; other times, the courts enforced
the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental
ideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one
person wronged the other in specific ways. This state of affairs really overstayed
its welcome. Well into the 20th century,
couples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed
with one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos
as evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted 
no-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse 
without proving harm, and importantly, 
without the other’s consent. The transition from cultural 
and religious rules to state sanctioned ones 
has always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored
their governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t 
recognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws
have been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce 
according to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow
for equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,
or community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain
people, almost always women. And even in the places where women 
aren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make
divorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss 
far more than men after divorce. At its best, modern no-fault divorce
allows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage 
is almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects 
of a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically 
complex issues.

**Transcript**:
The earliest known divorce
laws were written on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia
around 2000 BCE. Formally or informally, human societies 
across place and time have made rules 
to bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,
started with a trial partnership, during which a man could send 
his partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,
there was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, 
divorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners
with a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,
and why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some
of society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,
individual rights, and women’s rights. Religious authorities have often
regulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife 
without cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s
agreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled
divorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church
banning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing
it in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. In the late 18th century,
a series of changes took place that would eventually shape 
divorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance
separate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over
education, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first
of the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce 
for a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, 
and desertion, or simply mutual consent. Though progress was uneven, overall this
sort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European
colonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often
remained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more
serious for women— a man could divorce his wife
for adultery alone, while a woman would need
evidence of adultery, plus an additional offense
to divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard
was written into law; other times, the courts enforced
the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental
ideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one
person wronged the other in specific ways. This state of affairs really overstayed
its welcome. Well into the 20th century,
couples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed
with one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos
as evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted 
no-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse 
without proving harm, and importantly, 
without the other’s consent. The transition from cultural 
and religious rules to state sanctioned ones 
has always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored
their governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t 
recognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws
have been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce 
according to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow
for equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,
or community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain
people, almost always women. And even in the places where women 
aren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make
divorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss 
far more than men after divorce. At its best, modern no-fault divorce
allows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage 
is almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects 
of a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically 
complex issues.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1947, six Scandinavian
explorers noticed a strange phenomenon while crossing the Pacific Ocean. Somehow, small squid 
known to live deep beneath the waves kept appearing on the roof of their boat. The crew was mystified— until they saw the squids soaring
above the sea for roughly 50 meters. On land, people could barely believe
the explorers. It seemed impossible that sea creatures
without wings or bones could fly at all, let alone travel half the length 
of a football field. But over the next several decades,
more reports began to surface. Sailors described airborne squid keeping
pace with motor boats. Researchers reported captive squid
escaping their tanks overnight. And as cameras became widespread,
seafarers finally began capturing proof of these high-flying cephalopods. But how and why do 
these marine creatures take to the sky? While only a few squid species 
have been recorded taking flight, most squid are alike in the way 
they traverse the ocean. The outside of a squid’s body is a massive
tube of muscle called the mantle. Water enters that tube through small
openings around the squid’s head. Then, muscles clamp 
these openings shut, and the squid forcefully pumps the water
through the base of their body. In practice, this makes the mantle
a miniature jetpack, propelling squid through the water 
at 10 kilometers per hour. This process is also how squid breathe. Squid gills rest inside the mantle, and siphon oxygen from the water
being pushed past them. With gills full of air 
and a mantle full of water, squid can outpace predators 
and pursue their prey. Or, in the case of some species, they can 
smash through the ocean’s surface, and attempt an epic flight. Without the resistance of water, a squid’s acceleration 
is the same as a car going from zero to 100 kilometers 
per hour in just over a second. At speeds of 40 kilometers per hour, 
squid quickly generate aerodynamic lift. But to stay in the air they’ll need
something like wings. Fortunately, our soaring cephalopod
has a plan. Squid tentacles are "muscular hydrostats,"
meaning the tissue can be held firm by muscle tension. Splaying its tentacles 
in a rigid formation, the squid transforms them 
into flexible wing-like structures that stabilise its flight. At the opposite end of its body, two fins
typically used for gentle swimming find new purpose as a second set of wings. And by folding these fins down, a squid can streamline itself
and dip back into the ocean. There have been too few observations to establish what a squid’s 
typical flight trajectory looks like. Based on their flying speed, 
a 10 centimeter squid could hypothetically launch itself 
six meters above the water. But from what scientists have seen,
flying squid tend to glide low, keeping close to the surface. This trajectory allows squid to cover
the most horizontal distance possible over a typical several second flight. It also makes it easy to dive back 
into the water for more fuel— or to make a quick escape 
from predatory birds. But why do squids fly at all? Leading theories suggest that flight
is an escape behaviour, as flying squid generally seem 
to be fleeing a nearby predator or ship. Other researchers think their flight may be an energy-saving
migration strategy, because it takes less energy to move
quickly through the air than through water. However, it’s also possible
that learning to fly may be a vital part
of surviving adolescence. Young, smaller squid can potentially
fly faster and farther than their larger relatives. And since adult squid tend 
to cannibalize juveniles, soaring above the surf can help ensure
these young squid will live to fly another day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How does a flying squid get airborne?

The ground truth MCQ asks about the distance a squid travels in a flight, while Question 5 asks about the typical flight trajectory of a flying squid. Although not identical, Question 5's option B mentions that the squid's trajectory allows it to cover a lot of horizontal distance, which is related to the distance traveled.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the distance a squid travels in a flight. If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 5, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1947, six Scandinavian
explorers noticed a strange phenomenon while crossing the Pacific Ocean. Somehow, small squid 
known to live deep beneath the waves kept appearing on the roof of their boat. The crew was mystified— until they saw the squids soaring
above the sea for roughly 50 meters. On land, people could barely believe
the explorers. It seemed impossible that sea creatures
without wings or bones could fly at all, let alone travel half the length 
of a football field. But over the next several decades,
more reports began to surface. Sailors described airborne squid keeping
pace with motor boats. Researchers reported captive squid
escaping their tanks overnight. And as cameras became widespread,
seafarers finally began capturing proof of these high-flying cephalopods. But how and why do 
these marine creatures take to the sky? While only a few squid species 
have been recorded taking flight, most squid are alike in the way 
they traverse the ocean. The outside of a squid’s body is a massive
tube of muscle called the mantle. Water enters that tube through small
openings around the squid’s head. Then, muscles clamp 
these openings shut, and the squid forcefully pumps the water
through the base of their body. In practice, this makes the mantle
a miniature jetpack, propelling squid through the water 
at 10 kilometers per hour. This process is also how squid breathe. Squid gills rest inside the mantle, and siphon oxygen from the water
being pushed past them. With gills full of air 
and a mantle full of water, squid can outpace predators 
and pursue their prey. Or, in the case of some species, they can 
smash through the ocean’s surface, and attempt an epic flight. Without the resistance of water, a squid’s acceleration 
is the same as a car going from zero to 100 kilometers 
per hour in just over a second. At speeds of 40 kilometers per hour, 
squid quickly generate aerodynamic lift. But to stay in the air they’ll need
something like wings. Fortunately, our soaring cephalopod
has a plan. Squid tentacles are "muscular hydrostats,"
meaning the tissue can be held firm by muscle tension. Splaying its tentacles 
in a rigid formation, the squid transforms them 
into flexible wing-like structures that stabilise its flight. At the opposite end of its body, two fins
typically used for gentle swimming find new purpose as a second set of wings. And by folding these fins down, a squid can streamline itself
and dip back into the ocean. There have been too few observations to establish what a squid’s 
typical flight trajectory looks like. Based on their flying speed, 
a 10 centimeter squid could hypothetically launch itself 
six meters above the water. But from what scientists have seen,
flying squid tend to glide low, keeping close to the surface. This trajectory allows squid to cover
the most horizontal distance possible over a typical several second flight. It also makes it easy to dive back 
into the water for more fuel— or to make a quick escape 
from predatory birds. But why do squids fly at all? Leading theories suggest that flight
is an escape behaviour, as flying squid generally seem 
to be fleeing a nearby predator or ship. Other researchers think their flight may be an energy-saving
migration strategy, because it takes less energy to move
quickly through the air than through water. However, it’s also possible
that learning to fly may be a vital part
of surviving adolescence. Young, smaller squid can potentially
fly faster and farther than their larger relatives. And since adult squid tend 
to cannibalize juveniles, soaring above the surf can help ensure
these young squid will live to fly another day.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the speed of a squid in air compared to water. While there isn't a direct match, Question 3: "How do squid generate aerodynamic lift when they exit the water?" mentions the acceleration of a squid in air, which is related to its speed.

However, a more relevant question is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **3**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more relevant question should be generated to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
According to legend,
in the 27th century BCE, the Yellow Emperor of China charged
his historian, Cangjie, to develop a system of writing. Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie
noticed the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created
the first Chinese characters. And that night, the sky rained millet
while ghosts cried, fearing their actions may now be
condemned by the written word. We can’t say for sure whether
the story is true. But the earliest artifacts containing
Chinese characters date to the Shang Dynasty,
around 1250 to 1050 BCE, still making it one of the earliest
forms of written language. Characters etched on ox bones
and turtle shells show Shang kings’ writings
to their ancestors, discussing everything from agriculture
to the origins of a toothache. And as the legend suggests, these ancient characters
were mainly pictograms, or symbols that resemble
what they’re meant to represent. Even today, some of the most foundational
Chinese characters remain pictographic, like rén (人), which means person,
and mù (木), which means wood or tree. Some characters are ideograms, or
symbols that represent abstract concepts, like the numbers yī (一),
èr (二), and sān (三). Others are compound ideograms, which combine two or more
pictograms or ideograms. For example, xiū (休) places
the character for person next to the character for tree
and means to rest. However, most modern-day characters
are known as logograms, and are constructed of two components:
a radical component, which gestures at the meaning
of the character, and a sound component,
which hints at its pronunciation. And all characters are built
from a variety of strokes, which are often simplified
to eight basic types. There are 214 radicals,
each with its own definition. Some can stand alone, while others cannot. For instance, the radical rì (日),
written on its own means sun. It’s also used in characters
with sun-related definitions, such as xiǎo (晓) meaning dawn. The radical cǎo (艹), on the other hand,
never stands alone, but can be found within characters related
to grass and plants, like huā (花) meaning flower. And the radical shuǐ (水), meaning water,
always stands alone, but has a variant (氵) that is used when
it’s part of more complex characters like hé (河), meaning river. Radicals can appear
in different positions: to the left, to the right, above, below, or even surrounding the rest
of the character. There are many more sound components
than radicals, with estimates ranging in the thousands. Similar sounding words often share
the same sound component, and their radicals help shed light
on their meanings. Take fēng (峰) and fēng (蜂). The radical shān (山) means mountain, which hints at the first
character’s definition: summit. The radical in the second character,
chóng (虫), means insect, and together with the sound component
means bee. While many words in Chinese sound similar,
just like in other languages, context or tonality helps
clarify their meaning. Yet how each character is pronounced
depends on dialect, which varies across the country. So conversations in Chengdu may sound
vastly different than in Nanjing, but in both places,
the written language is the same. And unlike the romance languages, Chinese has no gendered nouns
or verb conjugations. So the character chī (吃), meaning to eat,
remains unchanged whether the subject is yourself,
a coworker, or a lesion of fearful ghosts. To indicate the past, a marker
like le (了) can be added. So “I eat bread” becomes “I ate bread.” Over the years, the Chinese writing
system has undergone many changes. As characters went from being
etched in bone, to cast in bronze, to brushed on paper, their script has evolved along the way. In the 1950s and 60s,
the Chinese Communist Party introduced new simplified versions
of the traditional characters, which are now standard in China, though traditional characters remain
in use in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And while the Chinese character
system may seem unique, its development greatly influenced
the spoken languages and writing systems of its neighbors. For example, around 60% of Japanese
dictionary entries are kanji— characters that originated in Chinese
or were created from its elements. With a 3,000 year history, Chinese characters have and will
continue to leave their mark.

**Transcript**:
According to legend,
in the 27th century BCE, the Yellow Emperor of China charged
his historian, Cangjie, to develop a system of writing. Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie
noticed the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created
the first Chinese characters. And that night, the sky rained millet
while ghosts cried, fearing their actions may now be
condemned by the written word. We can’t say for sure whether
the story is true. But the earliest artifacts containing
Chinese characters date to the Shang Dynasty,
around 1250 to 1050 BCE, still making it one of the earliest
forms of written language. Characters etched on ox bones
and turtle shells show Shang kings’ writings
to their ancestors, discussing everything from agriculture
to the origins of a toothache. And as the legend suggests, these ancient characters
were mainly pictograms, or symbols that resemble
what they’re meant to represent. Even today, some of the most foundational
Chinese characters remain pictographic, like rén (人), which means person,
and mù (木), which means wood or tree. Some characters are ideograms, or
symbols that represent abstract concepts, like the numbers yī (一),
èr (二), and sān (三). Others are compound ideograms, which combine two or more
pictograms or ideograms. For example, xiū (休) places
the character for person next to the character for tree
and means to rest. However, most modern-day characters
are known as logograms, and are constructed of two components:
a radical component, which gestures at the meaning
of the character, and a sound component,
which hints at its pronunciation. And all characters are built
from a variety of strokes, which are often simplified
to eight basic types. There are 214 radicals,
each with its own definition. Some can stand alone, while others cannot. For instance, the radical rì (日),
written on its own means sun. It’s also used in characters
with sun-related definitions, such as xiǎo (晓) meaning dawn. The radical cǎo (艹), on the other hand,
never stands alone, but can be found within characters related
to grass and plants, like huā (花) meaning flower. And the radical shuǐ (水), meaning water,
always stands alone, but has a variant (氵) that is used when
it’s part of more complex characters like hé (河), meaning river. Radicals can appear
in different positions: to the left, to the right, above, below, or even surrounding the rest
of the character. There are many more sound components
than radicals, with estimates ranging in the thousands. Similar sounding words often share
the same sound component, and their radicals help shed light
on their meanings. Take fēng (峰) and fēng (蜂). The radical shān (山) means mountain, which hints at the first
character’s definition: summit. The radical in the second character,
chóng (虫), means insect, and together with the sound component
means bee. While many words in Chinese sound similar,
just like in other languages, context or tonality helps
clarify their meaning. Yet how each character is pronounced
depends on dialect, which varies across the country. So conversations in Chengdu may sound
vastly different than in Nanjing, but in both places,
the written language is the same. And unlike the romance languages, Chinese has no gendered nouns
or verb conjugations. So the character chī (吃), meaning to eat,
remains unchanged whether the subject is yourself,
a coworker, or a lesion of fearful ghosts. To indicate the past, a marker
like le (了) can be added. So “I eat bread” becomes “I ate bread.” Over the years, the Chinese writing
system has undergone many changes. As characters went from being
etched in bone, to cast in bronze, to brushed on paper, their script has evolved along the way. In the 1950s and 60s,
the Chinese Communist Party introduced new simplified versions
of the traditional characters, which are now standard in China, though traditional characters remain
in use in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And while the Chinese character
system may seem unique, its development greatly influenced
the spoken languages and writing systems of its neighbors. For example, around 60% of Japanese
dictionary entries are kanji— characters that originated in Chinese
or were created from its elements. With a 3,000 year history, Chinese characters have and will
continue to leave their mark.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What type of symbols are the earliest Chinese characters, which resemble what they represent? Options: A. Logograms, B. Pictograms, C. Ideograms, D. Compound ideograms**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and options. The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of most Chinese characters, while Question 3 asks about the type of the earliest Chinese characters. However, both questions have similar options, including logograms, pictograms, and ideograms.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the type of most Chinese characters, but since such a question is not available, Question 3 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Though Oedipus would dodge death,
vanquish the monstrous Sphinx, and whether wrathful plagues, the truth would prove
his greatest challenger. When Oedipus’ mother,
Queen Jocasta of Thebes, gave birth to him,
a grim heir seized the occasion. Her husband, King Laius, had received
a prophecy from Apollo’s oracle foretelling that he would die
at the hands of his own son. Determined to escape this fate,
Laius had the newborn’s ankles pierced, and Jocasta ordered a shepherd to abandon
him on Mount Cithaeron to perish. But divine prophecies
can be quite stubborn. The shepherd took pity on the baby
and gave him to to another shepherd— this one from Corinth. He decided to bring the baby to the
childless Corinthian king and queen, Polybus and Merope. They called the boy Oedipus,
or “swollen-foot,” and raised him as their own,
never revealing his true origin. Years passed, till one night, a drunken reveler told Oedipus that he was
not Polybus and Merope’s son by birth— an allegation they staunchly denied. But the seeds of doubt burrowed
into Oedipus’ mind. He left to seek counsel
from Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, who instead delivered
a deeply disturbing prophecy: Oedipus would murder his father
and have children with his mother. Horrified, Oedipus determined
to stay far from Corinth and the only parents he’d ever known. He ventured towards Thebes—
and thus, unwittingly, towards the city where his
birth parents reigned. At a crossroads on the way, a fancy carriage threatened to run
Oedipus off the road, and a lethal fight ensued. Little did Oedipus know, one of the
casualties was King Laius of Thebes, his own birth father. In killing him, Oedipus had fulfilled
the first half of Apollo’s prophecy. When Oedipus reached the gates of Thebes,
he was met by the treacherous Sphinx. She’d ravaged the city, posing a bewildering riddle
to those she encountered and mercilessly devouring
all who answered incorrectly. But when she fixed her keen,
expectant gaze on Oedipus, he gave the correct response. Thebes celebrated the Sphinx's defeat, and Oedipus married the city's recently
widowed queen, Jocasta. They had four children, neither realizing
they were, in fact, mother and son— or that they’d completed the second half
of Apollo’s prophecy. Eventually, a devastating plague
descended on Thebes. To save the city, Oedipus sent his
brother-in-law to consult Apollo’s oracle. She declared that the divine plague
would only relent if the killer of Thebes’
previous king, Laius, was finally revealed,
then driven out or avenged with blood. Oedipus hastily opened an investigation. He interrogated Tiresias, a blind prophet, who stayed silent before suggesting
that Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus denied and deflected
the accusation. But it stuck with him. Jocasta likewise insisted that Laius’
killer couldn’t have been Oedipus, for she'd heard that Laius was killed
at a crossroads by robbers. Yet, through conversations with a
messenger from Corinth and, finally, the shepherd who’d rescued him
as an infant, the truth came bearing down upon Oedipus. In searching for Laius’ murderer,
he’d been looking for himself, and Apollo’s prophecy had come to pass,
in all its dreadful detail. Full of fury, resentment, and shame,
Oedipus rushed to kill Jocasta— but she too had realized the truth
and taken her own life. Using brooches from her dress,
Oedipus blinded himself in anguish, expunging his deceitful sense of sight, which had kept him
from truly seeing so much. Oedipus begged for exile, but was led back into the castle
to await word from Apollo’s oracle. Thus ends Sophocles’ first play
centering Oedipus. But it wouldn’t be his final word
on the tragic hero. Decades later, a roughly 89-year-old
Sophocles wrote its sequel, set in Colonus, his own birthplace. It finds Oedipus, now aged and exiled, confronted with accusations
of incest and patricide. Oedipus, having accepted the truth
and released himself from its shame, proclaims his innocence and maintains
that he committed these deeds unwittingly— and unwillingly. Finally, Oedipus knows it’s time to go—
and a divine voice urges him on. Having said his loving farewells, Oedipus then transcends—
peacefully and marvelously— into death.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Oedipus's adoptive father. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 4 mentions Polybus, who is Oedipus's adoptive father.

However, an even more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about Oedipus's parentage or adoption. Question 4 is the closest match, but it does not directly ask about Oedipus's adoptive father.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be: "Who told Oedipus that he was not the biological son of Polybus and Merope?" (Question 4), with an added option that directly asks about the identity of Oedipus's adoptive father.

Since the provided generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is Question 4.

However, please note that this is not an exact match.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the city where Oedipus grew up. A related generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks who told Oedipus that he was not the biological son of Polybus and Merope. Although this question does not directly ask about the city where Oedipus grew up, it is related to Oedipus' upbringing and his relationship with Polybus and Merope, who were his adoptive parents in Corinth.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about Oedipus' childhood or his adoptive parents. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 4, but with the understanding that it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Though Oedipus would dodge death,
vanquish the monstrous Sphinx, and whether wrathful plagues, the truth would prove
his greatest challenger. When Oedipus’ mother,
Queen Jocasta of Thebes, gave birth to him,
a grim heir seized the occasion. Her husband, King Laius, had received
a prophecy from Apollo’s oracle foretelling that he would die
at the hands of his own son. Determined to escape this fate,
Laius had the newborn’s ankles pierced, and Jocasta ordered a shepherd to abandon
him on Mount Cithaeron to perish. But divine prophecies
can be quite stubborn. The shepherd took pity on the baby
and gave him to to another shepherd— this one from Corinth. He decided to bring the baby to the
childless Corinthian king and queen, Polybus and Merope. They called the boy Oedipus,
or “swollen-foot,” and raised him as their own,
never revealing his true origin. Years passed, till one night, a drunken reveler told Oedipus that he was
not Polybus and Merope’s son by birth— an allegation they staunchly denied. But the seeds of doubt burrowed
into Oedipus’ mind. He left to seek counsel
from Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, who instead delivered
a deeply disturbing prophecy: Oedipus would murder his father
and have children with his mother. Horrified, Oedipus determined
to stay far from Corinth and the only parents he’d ever known. He ventured towards Thebes—
and thus, unwittingly, towards the city where his
birth parents reigned. At a crossroads on the way, a fancy carriage threatened to run
Oedipus off the road, and a lethal fight ensued. Little did Oedipus know, one of the
casualties was King Laius of Thebes, his own birth father. In killing him, Oedipus had fulfilled
the first half of Apollo’s prophecy. When Oedipus reached the gates of Thebes,
he was met by the treacherous Sphinx. She’d ravaged the city, posing a bewildering riddle
to those she encountered and mercilessly devouring
all who answered incorrectly. But when she fixed her keen,
expectant gaze on Oedipus, he gave the correct response. Thebes celebrated the Sphinx's defeat, and Oedipus married the city's recently
widowed queen, Jocasta. They had four children, neither realizing
they were, in fact, mother and son— or that they’d completed the second half
of Apollo’s prophecy. Eventually, a devastating plague
descended on Thebes. To save the city, Oedipus sent his
brother-in-law to consult Apollo’s oracle. She declared that the divine plague
would only relent if the killer of Thebes’
previous king, Laius, was finally revealed,
then driven out or avenged with blood. Oedipus hastily opened an investigation. He interrogated Tiresias, a blind prophet, who stayed silent before suggesting
that Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus denied and deflected
the accusation. But it stuck with him. Jocasta likewise insisted that Laius’
killer couldn’t have been Oedipus, for she'd heard that Laius was killed
at a crossroads by robbers. Yet, through conversations with a
messenger from Corinth and, finally, the shepherd who’d rescued him
as an infant, the truth came bearing down upon Oedipus. In searching for Laius’ murderer,
he’d been looking for himself, and Apollo’s prophecy had come to pass,
in all its dreadful detail. Full of fury, resentment, and shame,
Oedipus rushed to kill Jocasta— but she too had realized the truth
and taken her own life. Using brooches from her dress,
Oedipus blinded himself in anguish, expunging his deceitful sense of sight, which had kept him
from truly seeing so much. Oedipus begged for exile, but was led back into the castle
to await word from Apollo’s oracle. Thus ends Sophocles’ first play
centering Oedipus. But it wouldn’t be his final word
on the tragic hero. Decades later, a roughly 89-year-old
Sophocles wrote its sequel, set in Colonus, his own birthplace. It finds Oedipus, now aged and exiled, confronted with accusations
of incest and patricide. Oedipus, having accepted the truth
and released himself from its shame, proclaims his innocence and maintains
that he committed these deeds unwittingly— and unwillingly. Finally, Oedipus knows it’s time to go—
and a divine voice urges him on. Having said his loving farewells, Oedipus then transcends—
peacefully and marvelously— into death.

**Transcript**:
You’ve spent months creating
a basketball-playing robot, the Dunk-O-Matic, and you’re excited to demonstrate it
at the prestigious Sportecha Conference. Until you read an advertisement: “See the Dunk-O-Matic face human players
and automatically adjust its skill to create a fair game for every opponent!” That's not what you were told to create. You designed a robot that shoots baskets, sometimes successfully and sometimes not,
taking turns with a human opponent. No one said anything about teaching it
to adjust its performance. Maybe the CEO skimmed an article
about AI and overpromised, setting you up for public embarrassment. Luckily, you installed a feature
where given any probability q, you can adjust the robot to have that
probability of success on each attempt. You swiftly gather information,
and jackpot: your team has a dossier on all
potential demo participants, including the probability each has
of making baskets. In each match, the human shoots first,
then the robot, then the human again, and so on until someone makes
the first successful basket and wins. You can remotely adjust the Dunk-O-Matic’s
probability between opponents. What should that probability
be for each opponent, so that the human has a 50% chance
of winning each match? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You might guess that q
should be equal to p. But that ignores the advantage
of going first. Suppose p and q are both 100%. Even though the competitors
are equally skilled, the first player always wins. So a deeper analysis is required. One approach involves adding up every
chance the human has to win, using geometric series. A geometric series is an infinite
sum of numbers, where each number is the previous number
multiplied by a common ratio. Two facts about geometric series
are useful here. First, if the common ratio r
of a geometric series has absolute value less than 1, the series has a finite total. And second, if the first number
in the series is a, that total is: a divided by 1-minus-r. How does this help us calibrate our robot? Remember that the human has probability p
of making a basket. Since they go first, they have probability
p of winning on the first try. What’s the probability that they win
on the second try? That attempt only happens
if both players miss. The probability of a miss is 1 minus
the probability of a success, so the miss probabilities are
1-minus-p and 1-minus-q. The chance of both happening
is the product of those values. So the probability of two failures
and then a human success is p times (1-minus-p) times (1-minus-q). Winning on the third try requires
another round of misses, so that chance is p multiplied
by the double-miss probability twice. If we add all the possible probabilities
of a human win, the total is the sum
of a geometric series. Since the first number in the series is p, and the ratio is this product
that’s less than 1, the sum will be
(p divided by 1) minus the ratio. We want this sum to be 1/2. Using some algebra to solve for q, we find that q should equal p
divided by 1-minus-p. If p is greater than 50%,
q would need to be bigger than 1, which can’t happen. In that case, a fair game is impossible, because the human has a better-than-50%
chance of winning immediately. The robot's total probability is also
the total of a geometric series. How does this series compare
to the human’s? To win, the robot needs some number
of double misses, then a human failure
followed by a robot success. If q equals p over 1-minus-p, (1-minus-p) times q is p. For our choice of q, not only do these
series have the same sum, but they’re the same series! We could bypass geometric series
by starting with this reasoning. The robot’s chances of winning in the
first round is (1-minus-p) times q, and so if we want that chance to match
the human’s first-round chance, we want it to equal p,
making q: p over 1-minus-p. More rounds may occur,
but before each round, the competitors are tied,
so everything effectively restarts. If they have the same odds of winning
in the first round, they also will in the second round,
and so on. The demonstration goes perfectly, but while you didn't want
to embarrass yourself, you also didn’t want
to deceive the public. Taking the stage, you explain
your company’s false promises and your hastily ad-libbed solution. Thankfully, the ensuing bad press
is directed at your employers, and it turns out the
presentation volunteers own a more employee-friendly
robotics company. After some tedious intellectual
property litigation, you find yourself at a healthier workplace with a regular spot on a
pickup basketball team.

Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You might guess that q
should be equal to p. But that ignores the advantage
of going first. Suppose p and q are both 100%. Even though the competitors
are equally skilled, the first player always wins. So a deeper analysis is required. One approach involves adding up every
chance the human has to win, using geometric series. A geometric series is an infinite
sum of numbers, where each number is the previous number
multiplied by a common ratio. Two facts about geometric series
are useful here. First, if the common ratio r
of a geometric series has absolute value less than 1, the series has a finite total. And second, if the first number
in the series is a, that total is: a divided by 1-minus-r. How does this help us calibrate our robot? Remember that the human has probability p
of making a basket. Since they go first, they have probability
p of winning on the first try. What’s the probability that they win
on the second try? That attempt only happens
if both players miss. The probability of a miss is 1 minus
the probability of a success, so the miss probabilities are
1-minus-p and 1-minus-q. The chance of both happening
is the product of those values. So the probability of two failures
and then a human success is p times (1-minus-p) times (1-minus-q). Winning on the third try requires
another round of misses, so that chance is p multiplied
by the double-miss probability twice. If we add all the possible probabilities
of a human win, the total is the sum
of a geometric series. Since the first number in the series is p, and the ratio is this product
that’s less than 1, the sum will be
(p divided by 1) minus the ratio. We want this sum to be 1/2. Using some algebra to solve for q, we find that q should equal p
divided by 1-minus-p. If p is greater than 50%,
q would need to be bigger than 1, which can’t happen. In that case, a fair game is impossible, because the human has a better-than-50%

followed by a robot success. If q equals p over 1-minus-p, (1-minus-p) times q is p. For our choice of q, not only do these
series have the same sum, but they’re the same series! We could bypass geometric series
by starting with this reasoning. The robot’s chances of winning in the
first round is (1-minus-p) times q, and so if we want that chance to match
the human’s first-round chance, we want it to equal p,
making q: p over 1-minus-p. More rounds may occur,
but before each round, the competitors are tied,
so everything effectively restarts. If they have the same odds of winning
in the first round, they also will in the second round,
and so on. The demonstration goes perfectly, but while you didn't want
to embarrass yourself, you also didn’t want
to deceive the public. Taking the stage, you explain
your company’s false promises and your hastily ad-libbed solution. Thankfully, the ensuing bad press
is directed at your employers, and it turns out the
presentation volunteers own a more employee-friendly
robotics company. After some tedious intellectual
property litigation, you find yourself at a healthier workplace with a regular spot on a
pickup basketball team.

**Transcript**:
You’ve spent months creating
a basketball-playing robot, the Dunk-O-Matic, and you’re excited to demonstrate it
at the prestigious Sportecha Conference. Until you read an advertisement: “See the Dunk-O-Matic face human players
and automatically adjust its skill to create a fair game for every opponent!” That's not what you were told to create. You designed a robot that shoots baskets, sometimes successfully and sometimes not,
taking turns with a human opponent. No one said anything about teaching it
to adjust its performance. Maybe the CEO skimmed an article
about AI and overpromised, setting you up for public embarrassment. Luckily, you installed a feature
where given any probability q, you can adjust the robot to have that
probability of success on each attempt. You swiftly gather information,
and jackpot: your team has a dossier on all
potential demo participants, including the probability each has
of making baskets. In each match, the human shoots first,
then the robot, then the human again, and so on until someone makes
the first successful basket and wins. You can remotely adjust the Dunk-O-Matic’s
probability between opponents. What should that probability
be for each opponent, so that the human has a 50% chance
of winning each match? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You might guess that q
should be equal to p. But that ignores the advantage
of going first. Suppose p and q are both 100%. Even though the competitors
are equally skilled, the first player always wins. So a deeper analysis is required. One approach involves adding up every
chance the human has to win, using geometric series. A geometric series is an infinite
sum of numbers, where each number is the previous number
multiplied by a common ratio. Two facts about geometric series
are useful here. First, if the common ratio r
of a geometric series has absolute value less than 1, the series has a finite total. And second, if the first number
in the series is a, that total is: a divided by 1-minus-r. How does this help us calibrate our robot? Remember that the human has probability p
of making a basket. Since they go first, they have probability
p of winning on the first try. What’s the probability that they win
on the second try? That attempt only happens
if both players miss. The probability of a miss is 1 minus
the probability of a success, so the miss probabilities are
1-minus-p and 1-minus-q. The chance of both happening
is the product of those values. So the probability of two failures
and then a human success is p times (1-minus-p) times (1-minus-q). Winning on the third try requires
another round of misses, so that chance is p multiplied
by the double-miss probability twice. If we add all the possible probabilities
of a human win, the total is the sum
of a geometric series. Since the first number in the series is p, and the ratio is this product
that’s less than 1, the sum will be
(p divided by 1) minus the ratio. We want this sum to be 1/2. Using some algebra to solve for q, we find that q should equal p
divided by 1-minus-p. If p is greater than 50%,
q would need to be bigger than 1, which can’t happen. In that case, a fair game is impossible, because the human has a better-than-50%
chance of winning immediately. The robot's total probability is also
the total of a geometric series. How does this series compare
to the human’s? To win, the robot needs some number
of double misses, then a human failure
followed by a robot success. If q equals p over 1-minus-p, (1-minus-p) times q is p. For our choice of q, not only do these
series have the same sum, but they’re the same series! We could bypass geometric series
by starting with this reasoning. The robot’s chances of winning in the
first round is (1-minus-p) times q, and so if we want that chance to match
the human’s first-round chance, we want it to equal p,
making q: p over 1-minus-p. More rounds may occur,
but before each round, the competitors are tied,
so everything effectively restarts. If they have the same odds of winning
in the first round, they also will in the second round,
and so on. The demonstration goes perfectly, but while you didn't want
to embarrass yourself, you also didn’t want
to deceive the public. Taking the stage, you explain
your company’s false promises and your hastily ad-libbed solution. Thankfully, the ensuing bad press
is directed at your employers, and it turns out the
presentation volunteers own a more employee-friendly
robotics company. After some tedious intellectual
property litigation, you find yourself at a healthier workplace with a regular spot on a

**Transcript**:
The world is always abuzz with sounds, many of which human ears
simply can't hear. However, other species
have extraordinary adaptations that grant them access
to realms of sonic extremes. And some of them don’t even have ears—
at least, not like we typically imagine. To understand how the animal kingdom’s
best listeners do it, we need to know the rules of their game. When an object in a medium
like air or water moves, it sends out physical waves. The basics of hearing involve structures
that vibrate in response to these waves and excite sensory cells, generating signals that nerves transmit
to the brain, where they’re processed. But despite the assemblage
of sound-absorbing and -amplifying structures in our ears, many noises are too quiet
for us to detect. Owls, however, have some workarounds. Our external ears funnel sounds inward— but many owls use their whole faces
to do this. Their ears,
hidden beneath a flap of feathers, have eardrums proportionally much larger
and more sensitive than humans’. And because many owls ears
are positioned asymmetrically, sound waves reach them at different times. This slight delay helps their brains
determine the direction of the sound’s source. And great grey owl wings have
especially thick velvety coatings and long feather combs and fringes, which are thought to help reduce
their flight sounds. So, while hovering,
they can go undetected and concentrate on the subtle sounds
of their prey. All these adaptations enable
a great grey owl to hear a vole tunneling under 18 inches of snow— and make a fatal strike. Other animals are almost all ears, like the aptly named long-eared jerboa, which is the animal kingdom’s largest ears
in proportion to body length. These sizable sound-collectors help
the jerboas sense low frequency noises— and keep cool by radiating heat. Fennec foxes use
their large, swiveling ears to rapidly home in on activity
beneath Sahara sands, while bat-eared foxes can
pick up savanna sounds as slight as termites crawling
and munching on grasses. Ogre-faced spiders, meanwhile, might not have ears in the traditional
vertebrate sense, but their legs are covered by receptors
sensitive to sound waves as soft as those generated
by mosquito flight. This allows them to catch airborne prey— even after being blindfolded
by scientists. Lots of different features also help
animal ears hit especially high notes, like the extra hard, stiff middle ear
bones of toothed whales; like dolphins and sperm whales, which efficiently propagate
high-frequency vibrations. Indeed, some toothed whales and bats
emit sound pulses around 200,000 hertz and listen for the reflections. These high-frequency wavelengths— more than 10 times higher
than what we can hear— are small enough to generate
strong reflections from objects as tiny as the insects
many bats are after, which would be missed altogether
by lower ones. But many insects are also
in on the conversation— and vigilant to ultrasonic onslaughts. The greater wax moth can register
the highest frequencies of any animal recorded—
up to 300,000 hertz, thanks to thin, vibration-sensitive,
eardrum-like membranes on their abdomens. In fact, hearing organs have
evolved independently more than 20 times among insects. Katydids sense ultrasonic sounds
with their front legs; certain hawkmoths can hear
with their mouthparts; a parasitic fly registers cricket chirps
from organs behind its head; and the praying mantis has just one
hearing organ, which sits smack in the midline
of its thorax. But how low can animals go? Well, baleen whales emit sounds
around 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals. These vibrations can travel
thousands of kilometers. And they get picked up by other
baleen whales— possibly via their skulls, which conduct the vibrations
along to their ear bones. Snakes pick up ground vibrations
by way of their jawbones, which connect directly
to their middle ear bones. And Namib Desert golden moles regularly
stick their heads into the sand, which likely helps them use their large,
club-like middle ear bones to sense low frequency activity
in mounds more than 20 meters away. So, odds are: if a tree falls in a forest,
someone’s bound to hear it.

to realms of sonic extremes. And some of them don’t even have ears—
at least, not like we typically imagine. To understand how the animal kingdom’s
best listeners do it, we need to know the rules of their game. When an object in a medium
like air or water moves, it sends out physical waves. The basics of hearing involve structures
that vibrate in response to these waves and excite sensory cells, generating signals that nerves transmit
to the brain, where they’re processed. But despite the assemblage
of sound-absorbing and -amplifying structures in our ears, many noises are too quiet
for us to detect. Owls, however, have some workarounds. Our external ears funnel sounds inward— but many owls use their whole faces
to do this. Their ears,
hidden beneath a flap of feathers, have eardrums proportionally much larger
and more sensitive than humans’. And because many owls ears
are positioned asymmetrically, sound waves reach them at different times. This slight delay helps their brains
determine the direction of the sound’s source. And great grey owl wings have
especially thick velvety coatings and long feather combs and fringes, which are thought to help reduce
their flight sounds. So, while hovering,
they can go undetected and concentrate on the subtle sounds
of their prey. All these adaptations enable
a great grey owl to hear a vole tunneling under 18 inches of snow— and make a fatal strike. Other animals are almost all ears, like the aptly named long-eared jerboa, which is the animal kingdom’s largest ears
in proportion to body length. These sizable sound-collectors help
the jerboas sense low frequency noises— and keep cool by radiating heat. Fennec foxes use
their large, swiveling ears to rapidly home in on activity
beneath Sahara sands, while bat-eared foxes can
pick up savanna sounds as slight as termites crawling
and munching on grasses. Ogre-faced spiders, meanwhile, might not have ears in the traditional
vertebrate sense, but their legs are covered by receptors
sensitive to sound waves as soft as those generated
by mosquito flight. This allows them to catch airborne prey— even after being blindfolded
by scientists. Lots of different features also help
animal ears hit especially high notes, like the extra hard, stiff middle ear
bones of toothed whales; like dolphins and sperm whales, which efficiently propagate
high-frequency vibrations. Indeed, some toothed whales and bats
emit sound pulses around 200,000 hertz and listen for the reflections. These high-frequency wavelengths— more than 10 times higher
than what we can hear— are small enough to generate
strong reflections from objects as tiny as the insects
many bats are after, which would be missed altogether
by lower ones. But many insects are also
in on the conversation— and vigilant to ultrasonic onslaughts. The greater wax moth can register
the highest frequencies of any animal recorded—
up to 300,000 hertz, thanks to thin, vibration-sensitive,
eardrum-like membranes on their abdomens. In fact, hearing organs have
evolved independently more than 20 times among insects. Katydids sense ultrasonic sounds
with their front legs; certain hawkmoths can hear
with their mouthparts; a parasitic fly registers cricket chirps
from organs behind its head; and the praying mantis has just one
hearing organ, which sits smack in the midline
of its thorax. But how low can animals go? Well, baleen whales emit sounds
around 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals. These vibrations can travel
thousands of kilometers. And they get picked up by other
baleen whales— possibly via their skulls, which conduct the vibrations
along to their ear bones. Snakes pick up ground vibrations
by way of their jawbones, which connect directly
to their middle ear bones. And Namib Desert golden moles regularly
stick their heads into the sand, which likely helps them use their large,
club-like middle ear bones to sense low frequency activity
in mounds more than 20 meters away. So, odds are: if a tree falls in a forest,
someone’s bound to hear it.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the evolution of hearing organs in insects. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 8 mentions an insect (the greater wax moth) and its ability to register high frequencies.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly address the evolution of hearing organs in insects, I must conclude that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is tangentially related to the topic, I would suggest Question 8, but with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 8, with the caveat mentioned above)

**Transcript**:
“A candle is made to become
entirely flame. In that annihilating moment
it has no shadow.” According to legend, the renowned scholar,
Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi, was giving a lecture when an older,
disheveled man approached and asked him the meaning
of his academic books. Rumi didn’t know it yet,
but this question and this man would change his life. Annoyed at the interruption, Rumi snapped, “They are something that
you do not understand!” Suddenly, the books caught fire. The man looked back at the astounded Rumi
and simply replied: “You couldn’t possibly understand.” The mysterious figure was Shams of Tabriz, a charismatic Sufi mystic who would
transform Rumi's worldview. Rumi, inspired by Shams’ teachings, would go on to become one of the world’s
most celebrated poets and mystical philosophers, whose cultural legacy looms large across
Türkiye and the Persian-speaking world. Rumi was born in 1207
near the Afghan city of Balkh, and as a child emigrated to Anatolia,
where his father— a preacher and mystic— hoped to secure a more
prestigious position. By the time of Shams’ arrival, Rumi was a well-respected scholar
of Islamic law in the town of Konya. While he had been exposed to Sufism— the mystical path within Islam,
which focuses on experiencing God’s love— he’d shown little interest in it. But this changed in his late thirties,
when Shams came into his life. The academic study of law and theology
was no longer Rumi's central focus. Rather, he saw them as candles guiding
the way towards his ultimate goal: the reunification of his soul with God
through the experience of divine love. He wrote of this tension
in his native Persian, “Love resides not in learning,
not in knowledge, not in pages and books. Wherever the debates of men may lead,
that is not the lover’s path.” While Sufism had been part
of Islamic observance for centuries, the practices of some Sufis—
from ecstatic dancing to composing poetry— were looked down upon by conservative
religious elites. As Rumi increasingly embraced Sufism
under Shams’ influence, many of his earlier followers disapproved. When Shams suddenly disappeared,
suspicions arose that he'd been murdered. Rumi expressed his devastation
through poetry: “He bathed us like a candle in his light;
in thin air vanished, left us!” Rather than turning away from Sufism,
Rumi became more devoted, participating in ritualized dancing
and preaching the religion of love through lectures, poetry, and prose. And while Shams would never return,
Rumi continued to share his teachings, seeing himself as the moon
reflecting the light of Shams’ sun. While in his mystical states,
he composed the “Divan-i-Shams,” a sprawling collection of lyrical poems that included many of the sayings
for which he is famous today. The work expresses intense feelings
of love and longing, not only for his vanished mentor,
but for the divine creator. Over time, Rumi's poetry matured. He no longer saw himself
as a reflection of Shams, but as a beacon of light on his own. In his early fifties,
Rumi wrote “Masnavi,” which shifts from ecstatic expressions
of divine love to verses that guide others
to discover it for themselves. The poems are complex and layered, incorporating ideas, stories, and quotes
from Islamic religious texts, Arabic and Persian literature,
and earlier Sufi writings and poetry. In one story, he invokes the well-known
characters of Layla and the love-crazed Majnun. In Rumi’s version, the king, hearing Majnun’s musings
on Layla’s unsurpassed beauty, demands to see her. But when Layla arrives, he’s confused, as her beauty pales in comparison
to Majnun's praises. To this, Layla replies, “I am Layla.
The problem is you are not Majnun.” For Rumi, experiencing love meant opening
his heart to all of God’s creation— looking at everything and everyone
like Majnun gazing upon Layla. In this way, he saw romantic love
as an expression— on a smaller scale— of divine love. Following Rumi’s death, the Mevlevi Sufi
order was established around his teachings and still exists in Türkiye today. His poems and other writings were copied
and dispersed across the Islamic world, inspiring and shaping Persian poetry, before being introduced to the West
in the 19th century. For generations, his works have been
read and reread, translated and reinterpreted,
drawing admirers from around the world. While Rumi's words reflect his specific
historical context and Islamic worldview, for many, his message feels universal: “If you have lost heart
in the Path of Love, flee to me without delay: I am a fortress invincible.”

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of geographical information.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Rumi's origin, and the correct answer is Central Asia. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions Rumi's studies before he met Shams, and one of the options (not the correct one) is related to Rumi's geographical location (None of the options directly mention Central Asia).

However, a more careful analysis of the transcript reveals that Question 3 is the closest to providing information about Rumi's origin. According to the transcript, "Rumi was born in 1207 near the Afghan city of Balkh, and as a child emigrated to Anatolia..." This information implies that Rumi was originally from the region near Balkh, Afghanistan, which is part of Central Asia.

Considering this, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not present. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it would need to be rephrased to match the ground truth MCQ.

transform Rumi's worldview. Rumi, inspired by Shams’ teachings, would go on to become one of the world’s
most celebrated poets and mystical philosophers, whose cultural legacy looms large across
Türkiye and the Persian-speaking world. Rumi was born in 1207
near the Afghan city of Balkh, and as a child emigrated to Anatolia,
where his father— a preacher and mystic— hoped to secure a more
prestigious position. By the time of Shams’ arrival, Rumi was a well-respected scholar
of Islamic law in the town of Konya. While he had been exposed to Sufism— the mystical path within Islam,
which focuses on experiencing God’s love— he’d shown little interest in it. But this changed in his late thirties,
when Shams came into his life. The academic study of law and theology
was no longer Rumi's central focus. Rather, he saw them as candles guiding
the way towards his ultimate goal: the reunification of his soul with God
through the experience of divine love. He wrote of this tension
in his native Persian, “Love resides not in learning,
not in knowledge, not in pages and books. Wherever the debates of men may lead,
that is not the lover’s path.” While Sufism had been part
of Islamic observance for centuries, the practices of some Sufis—
from ecstatic dancing to composing poetry— were looked down upon by conservative
religious elites. As Rumi increasingly embraced Sufism
under Shams’ influence, many of his earlier followers disapproved. When Shams suddenly disappeared,
suspicions arose that he'd been murdered. Rumi expressed his devastation
through poetry: “He bathed us like a candle in his light;
in thin air vanished, left us!” Rather than turning away from Sufism,
Rumi became more devoted, participating in ritualized dancing
and preaching the religion of love through lectures, poetry, and prose. And while Shams would never return,
Rumi continued to share his teachings, seeing himself as the moon
reflecting the light of Shams’ sun. While in his mystical states,
he composed the “Divan-i-Shams,” a sprawling collection of lyrical poems that included many of the sayings
for which he is famous today. The work expresses intense feelings
of love and longing, not only for his vanished mentor,
but for the divine creator. Over time, Rumi's poetry matured. He no longer saw himself
as a reflection of Shams, but as a beacon of light on his own. In his early fifties,
Rumi wrote “Masnavi,” which shifts from ecstatic expressions
of divine love to verses that guide others
to discover it for themselves. The poems are complex and layered, incorporating ideas, stories, and quotes
from Islamic religious texts, Arabic and Persian literature,
and earlier Sufi writings and poetry. In one story, he invokes the well-known
characters of Layla and the love-crazed Majnun. In Rumi’s version, the king, hearing Majnun’s musings
on Layla’s unsurpassed beauty, demands to see her. But when Layla arrives, he’s confused, as her beauty pales in comparison
to Majnun's praises. To this, Layla replies, “I am Layla.
The problem is you are not Majnun.” For Rumi, experiencing love meant opening
his heart to all of God’s creation— looking at everything and everyone
like Majnun gazing upon Layla. In this way, he saw romantic love
as an expression— on a smaller scale— of divine love. Following Rumi’s death, the Mevlevi Sufi
order was established around his teachings and still exists in Türkiye today. His poems and other writings were copied
and dispersed across the Islamic world, inspiring and shaping Persian poetry, before being introduced to the West
in the 19th century. For generations, his works have been
read and reread, translated and reinterpreted,
drawing admirers from around the world. While Rumi's words reflect his specific
historical context and Islamic worldview, for many, his message feels universal: “If you have lost heart
in the Path of Love, flee to me without delay: I am a fortress invincible.”

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 3: "What was the focus of Rumi's studies before he met Shams?" is the most similar.

Although it does not directly ask about Rumi's religion, it does touch on his academic background, which is related to his religious studies. Additionally, Islamic law is mentioned as one of the options, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if I really had to choose, I would say: Question 3 (Index: 3)

Options: A. To become a well-respected scholar of Islamic law, B. To experience divine love and reunite his soul with God, C. To compose poetry and participate in ecstatic dancing, D. To preach the religion of love through lectures and prose

Although the question is not an exact match, the intent and content are closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the primary focus of Rumi's poetry. The correct option in Question 4, "To experience divine love and reunite his soul with God," is closely related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ, "Love." Additionally, the other options in Question 4 are not directly related to the primary focus of Rumi's poetry, making it a good match.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **4**

**Transcript**:
In 1996, a British Airways plane
flew from New York to London in a record-breaking 
two hours and 53 minutes. Today, however, passengers flying 
the same route can expect to spend no less than six hours
in the air— twice as long. So why, in a world where everything 
seems to be getting faster, have commercial flights lagged behind? The British-and-French-made Concorde
began shuttling passengers across the sky in the 1970s. Jetting between destinations like 
New York, Paris, Bahrain, and Singapore, it clocked in at over 2,000 kilometers 
per hour, more than twice the speed
of a normal airliner. However this was also about 800 kilometers
per hour faster than the speed of sound. And that created a surprising problem 
for people on the ground. When an object moves at supersonic speed, it generates a continuous moving shockwave
known as a sonic boom. This produces a loud, startling noise, as well as rattling windows and dislodging
structural elements of buildings. Since a plane flying at an altitude 
of 15 kilometers can affect an area with an 80 kilometer
diameter on the ground below, complaints and concerns from residents 
in the Concorde’s flight path restricted it to mostly ocean routes. Because of these restrictions and other
fuel and engineering requirements, supersonic flights turned out 
to be very expensive for both airlines and passengers. A single transatlantic
round-trip could cost the equivalent of more than $10,000 today. With additional strain 
on the airline industry due to decreased demand for flights
after September 11th, 2001, this became unsustainable, 
and the Concorde was retired in 2003. So even when superfast flights existed,
they weren't standard commercial flights. And while we might think that advances 
in flight technology would make fast flights less expensive, 
this hasn’t necessarily been the case. One of the biggest concerns 
is fuel economy. Over the decades, jet engines have become
a lot more efficient, taking in more air 
and achieving more thrust— traveling further for every
liter of fuel. But this efficiency is only achieved 
at speeds of up to around 900 kilometers per hour—
less than half the speed of the Concorde. Going any faster would increase air intake
and burn more fuel per kilometer flown. A standard transatlantic flight still uses
as much as 150,000 liters of fuel, amounting to over 20% 
of an airline’s total expenses. So any reduction in fuel economy 
and increase in speed would significantly increase both 
flight costs and environmental impact. What about ways to make a plane faster 
without burning lots of fuel? Adjusting the wing sweep, or the angle
at which wings protrude from the fuselage, to bring the wings closer in can 
make an aircraft faster by reducing aerodynamic drag. But this means the wings must be longer
to achieve the same wingspan, and that means more materials
and more weight, which in turn means burning more fuel. So while airplanes could be designed
to be more aerodynamic, this would make them more expensive. And generally, airlines have found 
that customer demand for faster flights is not sufficient to cover these costs. So while military aircraft conduct 
high speed flights over water and at high altitudes, supersonic commercial flights seemed
like a brief and failed experiment. But recent advances
may make them feasible again. Research by NASA and DARPA has shown 
that modifying an aircraft’s shape can reduce the impact 
of its sonic boom by 1/3. Extending the nose with a long spike can
break the shockwave into smaller ones, while another proposed design features 
two sets of wings producing waves 
that cancel each other out. And new technologies may solve 
the energy efficiency problem with alternative and synthetic fuels,
or even hybrid-electric planes. It may yet turn out that the last 
few decades of steady flying were just a brief rest stop.

**Transcript**:
And the clock starts... now. Did you miss it? It wasn’t some bug buzzing by 
or a weird trick of the light. You just saw a hummingbird perform
astonishing aerial acrobatics, eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,
and then escape a threat upside down— all in a matter of seconds. So let’s slow down the action, and unpack
each step in this blazing-fast feast. First up, their incredibly rapid flight. Hummingbirds typically beat their wings 
30 to 40 times per second, creating the high-frequency hum 
they’re named for. To flap their wings at this speed, hummingbirds have evolved 
giant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third 
of some species’ bodyweight. But the real secret to their fine-tuned
flight is all in the wrist. Most birds only generate lift 
on the downstroke of each flap, while using the upward recovery stroke 
to set up their next wing beat. Hummingbirds however, 
turn their wrists during the upstroke, changing their wing’s angle to flap 
in a figure 8 pattern that continually generates lift 
throughout their wingbeats. Alongside their massive muscles,
this special lift-producing technique allows hummingbirds to achieve 
sustained hovering flight— an aerial feat no other bird can perform. Hovering lets hummingbirds slow 
to a stop almost instantly and assess scenarios in midair. Then, they can take off in any direction, reaching speeds faster than a fighter jet,
relative to the bird’s size. And since they can beat each of their
wings at different speeds and angles, the birds can perform 
incredible spins and turns all while flying backwards 
or even upside down. Of course, flying this way 
can be exhausting. Hovering is one of the most energy
intensive forms of movement in the animal kingdom. And relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the highest 
metabolic rates of all vertebrates. This leads them to eat very frequently— often consuming an average 
of four meals an hour while flying. Fortunately, their hovering lets them eat
at remarkable angles without perching, consuming food that would otherwise
be impossible to reach. Using their long slender bills, they reach deep inside flowers 
and pump out nectar with their thin grooved tongues. This sugary liquid is a hummingbird’s
most important energy source, and a single bird consumes six times 
its weight in nectar every day over hundreds of small meals. Each of these sugary snacks also 
pollinates the flower being visited with pollen left on the bird 
from previous meals. That's just a rough idea of what
hummingbirds can do in several seconds. But if we hang around a little longer, we might see their aerial acrobatics
put to a more dangerous test. Hummingbirds keep track of which flowers
they've recently drained, as well as those they plan to drain next. And each bird will fight ruthlessly 
to defend this floral territory from their only real competition: 
other hummingbirds. Using their spear-like bills 
and blindingly fast flight, dueling hummingbirds chase each other 
through the air, aggressively stabbing 
and plucking feathers. The bills of some species are specialized
for fighting, with spiny tips, hooks, 
or even saw-like serrations. Some hummingbirds employ 
these aerial fencing techniques to chase off larger birds 
like hawks and owls. But the most extreme fights are between
male hummingbirds competing for flowers and females. Fortunately, these duels 
are rarely deadly. After 15 to 20 seconds, one bird
will typically surrender— flying off to seek its breakfast 
elsewhere. After all this fighting, feeding, 
and flying, hummingbirds sometimes need 
to sleep off the day’s events in a mild form of hibernation 
called torpor. Their hearts— proportionally 
the largest in the animal kingdom— slow from 1,200 beats per minute 
to a mere 50. But when they wake up 4 to 7 hours later, their lightning-fast metabolism 
kicks back into gear. With all this speed and strength, it’s no wonder the Aztecs revered 
these energetic birds as agents of the god of war 
Huitzilopotchli— a reminder that immense power 
can come in the smallest packages.

**Transcript**:
And the clock starts... now. Did you miss it? It wasn’t some bug buzzing by 
or a weird trick of the light. You just saw a hummingbird perform
astonishing aerial acrobatics, eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,
and then escape a threat upside down— all in a matter of seconds. So let’s slow down the action, and unpack
each step in this blazing-fast feast. First up, their incredibly rapid flight. Hummingbirds typically beat their wings 
30 to 40 times per second, creating the high-frequency hum 
they’re named for. To flap their wings at this speed, hummingbirds have evolved 
giant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third 
of some species’ bodyweight. But the real secret to their fine-tuned
flight is all in the wrist. Most birds only generate lift 
on the downstroke of each flap, while using the upward recovery stroke 
to set up their next wing beat. Hummingbirds however, 
turn their wrists during the upstroke, changing their wing’s angle to flap 
in a figure 8 pattern that continually generates lift 
throughout their wingbeats. Alongside their massive muscles,
this special lift-producing technique allows hummingbirds to achieve 
sustained hovering flight— an aerial feat no other bird can perform. Hovering lets hummingbirds slow 
to a stop almost instantly and assess scenarios in midair. Then, they can take off in any direction, reaching speeds faster than a fighter jet,
relative to the bird’s size. And since they can beat each of their
wings at different speeds and angles, the birds can perform 
incredible spins and turns all while flying backwards 
or even upside down. Of course, flying this way 
can be exhausting. Hovering is one of the most energy
intensive forms of movement in the animal kingdom. And relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the highest 
metabolic rates of all vertebrates. This leads them to eat very frequently— often consuming an average 
of four meals an hour while flying. Fortunately, their hovering lets them eat
at remarkable angles without perching, consuming food that would otherwise
be impossible to reach. Using their long slender bills, they reach deep inside flowers

**Transcript**:
Autism is something
that many people know about. For example, some people think that autistic people
are fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on
about the same topic. Some people think that autistic people
do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing
at the wrong time. Some people think that autistic people
are socially awkward and lack humor and empathy. Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have
the right impression of autism. How do I know? Because I have autism. I do have my own obsessions
with things like electronics and public transit, but that does not define me. Each of us are different
and unique in our own way. However, there is not
a lot of information out there on what an autistic life
actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes. And we see these often in the media. Some of the more common
stereotypes in the media include being socially awkward, lacking empathy and even being a supergenius. And the lack of knowledge
on autism doesn't stop there either. Did you know that some people
are trying to find a cure for autism? That's because they see it
as a negative thing, as a disease. Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism
is not a disease. It's just another way of thinking
and looking at the world. Our brains function differently
from most people's brains. Think of it like comparing
and Xbox and a PlayStation. They're both highly capable consoles
with different programming. But if you put your Xbox game
in a PlayStation, it won't work, because the PlayStation
communicates differently. When I look in the mirror, I see someone who thinks differently. Oh, and I also see nice hair. (Laughter) (Applause) But the question is, am I really diseased
if I just think differently? The main problem with living autistic
in today's society is that the world just isn't built for us. There's so many ways
that we can get overwhelmed. For example, the thing that makes me overwhelmed
all the time is loud noises, which means I never
crank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan
of large parties. But other people on the spectrum
might get overwhelmed with things like bright lights
or strong smells or gooey textures that all have the potential
to create anxiety. Think about all of the social gatherings
you've been to in the past. Was there loud music playing? Were there really bright lights? Were there lots of different food smells
going on at the same time? Were there lots of conversations
happening all at once? Those things may not
have bothered you guys, but for someone with autism, they can be quite overwhelming. So in those situations,
we do something called stimming, which is like a repetitive
motion or a noise or some other random fidgeting
that may or may not seem normal. Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin. Ya, it's basically our way of zoning out. It can often feel necessary
for us to stim. However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it. When we're forced to hide
our autistic traits like this, it's called masking. And some people mask better than others. I mask so well sometimes
that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal. (Laughs) But at the end of the day,
it gets really stressful. Even something like
doing my homework at night becomes very tiring. Some people think, because of our ability to mask, that this is the cure to autism. However, all it really does
is makes us ashamed of showing our true selves. Another common stereotype
that is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy. And again, this is not true. I actually have lots of empathy. I'm just not really good at showing it. Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggles
that they're going through, I often don't know
how to express my reply. And that is why I don't show
as much empathy as my nonautistic friends do. Emotional expression,
however much or however little, is difficult for me. And that is because I am bursting inside with every single emotion
one feels at all times. Though of course,
I cannot express it that way. Otherwise, let's say,
happiness, for example, would come out as a huge burst
of gleeful wheezing, hand flapping and loud vocal "woohoos." (Laughter) Whereas you may just smile. (Laughter) Whether it be receiving
an awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic
story on the news, I cannot really express my reply
without bursting, so once again, I have to mask it
in order to appear normal. My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me
express extremes or nothing. So my ... I am not great with my emotions, and I communicate differently, and because of that, I was diagnosed
with autism spectrum disorder. This diagnosis helps me
and my friends and family to know how my mind works. And in the world, approximately one percent
of the population is diagnosed with autism
spectrum disorder. And this number is growing. However, we are still a big minority. And there's still lots of people
that do not see us as equals to other people. This is my family. And in my family, there is one other person
who is also autistic. My mother. Yes, adult women can also be autistic. My dad and my brother
are both nonautistic. Sometimes it can be a bit difficult
for us to communicate with each other, however. Sometimes I'll say something like, "Oh, Toronto's Union Station, right?" thinking that I can help them to remember
certain aspects of it. When they get confused, I often
have to elaborate myself on that. And we often have to say things in a number of different ways
so that everyone understands. However, despite all that, we all love each other
and respect each other as equals. In his book "NeuroTribes," author Steve Silberman states
that autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, naturally part of a human spectrum and not as defects. And this is something
that I agree to completely. If autism was seen as part
of a natural human spectrum, then the world could be designed
to work better for autistic people. I am not ashamed of my autism. And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human
and I am not diseased. Thank you. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
After much debate, the fantasy realm 
you call home has decided dragon jousting may not be 
the best way to choose its leaders, and has begun transitioning to democracy. The candidates are a giant orange troll
and an experienced tree statesman. An all-powerful eyebrow has hired 
your company— The Dormor Polling Agency— to survey the citizens of the land
and predict who will win. There’s a lot riding on this: if you get it wrong, heads— 
well, your head— will quite literally roll. Your job is to go from door to door, asking voters whether they prefer
the troll or the treefellow and to use the results to project 
how the election will go. Your fellow citizens want you to succeed
and would tell you the truth... but there’s a problem. Few are willing to admit 
they support the troll on account of his controversial 
life choices. If you were to ask a troll supporter
who she'll vote for, there’s a good chance that she’ll claim 
to support the treeman, skewing your results. You’re about to begin your rounds when 
a stranger offers you some cryptic advice: “Here’s the question that will save your
neck: what have you got in your pocket?” You reach into your pocket and pull out...
a silver coin, which has the current king’s head 
on one side and his tail on the other. How can you use it to conduct
an accurate poll? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to use the coin 
to add random chance to your interaction that will give 
troll supporters deniability. In other words, you’re looking for 
a system where when someone says “troll,” it could either be because the coin 
somehow told them to, or because they actually 
support the troll— and you’d have no way to tell 
the difference. You’ll also need to know how frequently 
the coin skewed the results, so you can account
for it in your calculations. One solution is to have every pollee 
go into their house and flip the coin. If it lands heads, they should
tell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell 
you their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say 
they’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,
the coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes 
off his total, and know the troll’s real support 
is 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,
but before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in 
and burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed
constitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place 
in a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back 
out on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable
admitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a
dragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. 
How do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking 
just one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave 
space for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two
possible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone
flip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads
twice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails 
twice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination
to declare their true preference. The chances of getting either
two heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— 
or 25%. Subtracting that proportion 
of the total respondents from each candidate’s score should 
give you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced 
themselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll 
and another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals
that voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,
the troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day.

you their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say 
they’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,
the coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes 
off his total, and know the troll’s real support 
is 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,
but before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in 
and burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed
constitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place 
in a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back 
out on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable
admitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a
dragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. 
How do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking 
just one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave 
space for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two
possible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone
flip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads
twice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails 
twice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination
to declare their true preference. The chances of getting either
two heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— 
or 25%. Subtracting that proportion 
of the total respondents from each candidate’s score should 
give you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced 
themselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll 
and another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals
that voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,
the troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day.

**Transcript**:
After much debate, the fantasy realm 
you call home has decided dragon jousting may not be 
the best way to choose its leaders, and has begun transitioning to democracy. The candidates are a giant orange troll
and an experienced tree statesman. An all-powerful eyebrow has hired 
your company— The Dormor Polling Agency— to survey the citizens of the land
and predict who will win. There’s a lot riding on this: if you get it wrong, heads— 
well, your head— will quite literally roll. Your job is to go from door to door, asking voters whether they prefer
the troll or the treefellow and to use the results to project 
how the election will go. Your fellow citizens want you to succeed
and would tell you the truth... but there’s a problem. Few are willing to admit 
they support the troll on account of his controversial 
life choices. If you were to ask a troll supporter
who she'll vote for, there’s a good chance that she’ll claim 
to support the treeman, skewing your results. You’re about to begin your rounds when 
a stranger offers you some cryptic advice: “Here’s the question that will save your
neck: what have you got in your pocket?” You reach into your pocket and pull out...
a silver coin, which has the current king’s head 
on one side and his tail on the other. How can you use it to conduct
an accurate poll? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to use the coin 
to add random chance to your interaction that will give 
troll supporters deniability. In other words, you’re looking for 
a system where when someone says “troll,” it could either be because the coin 
somehow told them to, or because they actually 
support the troll— and you’d have no way to tell 
the difference. You’ll also need to know how frequently 
the coin skewed the results, so you can account
for it in your calculations. One solution is to have every pollee 
go into their house and flip the coin. If it lands heads, they should
tell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell 
you their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say

**Transcript**:
Historically, most cars have run 
on gasoline, but that doesn’t have to be
the case in the future: other liquid fuels and electricity
can also power cars. So what are the differences 
between these options? And which one’s best? Gasoline is refined from crude oil, a fossil fuel extracted
from deep underground. The energy in gasoline comes from a class
of molecules called hydrocarbons. There are hundreds of different
hydrocarbons in crude oil, and different ones are used 
to make gasoline and diesel— which is why you can't use
them interchangeably. Fuels derived from crude oil
are extremely energy dense, bringing a lot of bang for your buck. Unfortunately, they have many drawbacks. Oil spills cause environmental damage
and cost billions of dollars to clean up. Air pollution from burning 
fossil fuels like these kills 4.5 million people each year. And transportation accounts for 16%
of global greenhouse gas emissions, almost half of which comes 
from passenger cars burning fossil fuels. These emissions warm the planet 
and make weather more extreme. In the U.S. alone,
storms caused by climate change caused $500 billion of damage 
in the last five years. So while gas is efficient, something so destructive
can't be the best fuel. The most common alternative
is electricity. Electric cars use a battery pack
and electric motor instead of the internal combustion engine
found in gas-powered cars, and must be charged at charging stations. With the right power infrastructure, they
can be as efficient as gas-powered cars. If powered by electricity generated
without fossil fuels, they can avoid greenhouse gas emissions 
entirely. They’re more expensive 
than gas-powered cars, but the cost difference has been
shrinking rapidly since 2010. The other alternatives to gasoline
are other liquid fuels. Many of these can be shipped and stored
using the same infrastructure as gasoline, and used in the same cars. They can also be carbon-neutral 
if they’re made using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere— meaning when we burn them, we release that
same carbon dioxide back into the air, and don't add to overall emissions. One approach to carbon-neutral fuel
is to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combine its carbon
with the hydrogen in water. This creates hydrocarbons, 
the source of energy in fossil fuels— but without any emissions if the fuels 
are made using clean electricity. These fuels take up more space than an energetically equivalent
amount of gasoline— an obstacle to using them in cars. Another approach is to make carbon-neutral
fuels from plants, which sequester carbon from the air 
through photosynthesis. But growing the plants also has 
to be carbon neutral— which rules out many crops
that require fertilizer, a big contributor 
to greenhouse gas emissions. So the next generation of these fuels
must be made from either plant waste or plants that don't require
fertilizer to grow. Biofuels can be about as efficient
as gasoline, though not all are. For a fuel to be the best option, 
people have to be able to afford it. Unfortunately, the high upfront costs
of implementing new technologies and heavy subsidies for the producers 
of fossil fuels, mean that almost every green technology is more expensive than 
its fossil-fuel-based cousin. This cost difference is known
as a green premium. Governments have already started
subsidizing electric vehicles to help make up the difference. In some places, depending 
on the costs of electricity and gas, electric cars can already
be cheaper overall, despite the higher cost of the car. The other alternatives are trickier, 
for now— zero-carbon liquid fuels can be
double the price of gasoline or more. Innovators are doing everything
they can to bring green premiums down, because in the end, the best fuel 
will be both affordable for consumers and sustainable for our planet.

**Transcript**:
Historically, most cars have run 
on gasoline, but that doesn’t have to be
the case in the future: other liquid fuels and electricity
can also power cars. So what are the differences 
between these options? And which one’s best? Gasoline is refined from crude oil, a fossil fuel extracted
from deep underground. The energy in gasoline comes from a class
of molecules called hydrocarbons. There are hundreds of different
hydrocarbons in crude oil, and different ones are used 
to make gasoline and diesel— which is why you can't use
them interchangeably. Fuels derived from crude oil
are extremely energy dense, bringing a lot of bang for your buck. Unfortunately, they have many drawbacks. Oil spills cause environmental damage
and cost billions of dollars to clean up. Air pollution from burning 
fossil fuels like these kills 4.5 million people each year. And transportation accounts for 16%
of global greenhouse gas emissions, almost half of which comes 
from passenger cars burning fossil fuels. These emissions warm the planet 
and make weather more extreme. In the U.S. alone,
storms caused by climate change caused $500 billion of damage 
in the last five years. So while gas is efficient, something so destructive
can't be the best fuel. The most common alternative
is electricity. Electric cars use a battery pack
and electric motor instead of the internal combustion engine
found in gas-powered cars, and must be charged at charging stations. With the right power infrastructure, they
can be as efficient as gas-powered cars. If powered by electricity generated
without fossil fuels, they can avoid greenhouse gas emissions 
entirely. They’re more expensive 
than gas-powered cars, but the cost difference has been
shrinking rapidly since 2010. The other alternatives to gasoline
are other liquid fuels. Many of these can be shipped and stored
using the same infrastructure as gasoline, and used in the same cars. They can also be carbon-neutral 
if they’re made using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere— meaning when we burn them, we release that
same carbon dioxide back into the air, and don't add to overall emissions. One approach to carbon-neutral fuel
is to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combine its carbon
with the hydrogen in water. This creates hydrocarbons, 
the source of energy in fossil fuels— but without any emissions if the fuels 
are made using clean electricity. These fuels take up more space than an energetically equivalent
amount of gasoline— an obstacle to using them in cars. Another approach is to make carbon-neutral
fuels from plants, which sequester carbon from the air 
through photosynthesis. But growing the plants also has 
to be carbon neutral— which rules out many crops
that require fertilizer, a big contributor 
to greenhouse gas emissions. So the next generation of these fuels
must be made from either plant waste or plants that don't require
fertilizer to grow. Biofuels can be about as efficient
as gasoline, though not all are. For a fuel to be the best option, 
people have to be able to afford it. Unfortunately, the high upfront costs
of implementing new technologies and heavy subsidies for the producers 
of fossil fuels, mean that almost every green technology is more expensive than 
its fossil-fuel-based cousin. This cost difference is known
as a green premium. Governments have already started
subsidizing electric vehicles to help make up the difference. In some places, depending 
on the costs of electricity and gas, electric cars can already
be cheaper overall, despite the higher cost of the car. The other alternatives are trickier, 
for now— zero-carbon liquid fuels can be
double the price of gasoline or more. Innovators are doing everything
they can to bring green premiums down, because in the end, the best fuel 
will be both affordable for consumers and sustainable for our planet.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
No matter how we make electricity,
it takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines,
and plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,
facilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store 
the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines 
or solar panels. How much space depends
on the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt 
light bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce 
up to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized
chunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only
need an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least
0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly
7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— 
to power the bulb. When you consider the space needed 
to power cities, countries, and the whole world,
it adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts 
of electricity. To power the entire world 
with only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200
square kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost
four times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, 
a little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least
95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—
about the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability
in how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general
sense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure
in a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean 
are completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space 
they occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—
sometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency 
of the others. So, much of the land needed 
to generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space
still matters, because cities and other densely populated
areas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure 
works best when electricity is generated
where and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent
across long distances. Still, space demands are only
part of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity
comes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation 
is responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons 
of greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change 
and all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least
space of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases
and don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build
than solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered 
by fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel 
to generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places 
than others. No single approach will be
the best option to power the entire world while eliminating
harmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power
might be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., 
have the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity 
from renewables. And across the board, we should be working
to make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport 
in the case of renewables.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
No matter how we make electricity,
it takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines,
and plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,
facilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store 
the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines 
or solar panels. How much space depends
on the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt 
light bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce 
up to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized
chunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only
need an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least
0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly
7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— 
to power the bulb. When you consider the space needed 
to power cities, countries, and the whole world,
it adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts 
of electricity. To power the entire world 
with only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200
square kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost
four times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, 
a little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least
95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—
about the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability
in how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general
sense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure
in a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean 
are completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space 
they occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—
sometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency 
of the others. So, much of the land needed 
to generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space
still matters, because cities and other densely populated
areas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure 
works best when electricity is generated
where and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent
across long distances. Still, space demands are only
part of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity
comes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation 
is responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons 
of greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change 
and all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least
space of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases
and don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build
than solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered 
by fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel 
to generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places 
than others. No single approach will be
the best option to power the entire world while eliminating
harmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power
might be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., 
have the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity 
from renewables. And across the board, we should be working
to make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport 
in the case of renewables.

**Transcript**:
As a breeze blows through the savannah, a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air
and scans the horizon like a periscope. But it’s not seeing— 
it’s sniffing for odors like the scent of a watering hole 
or the musk of a dangerous predator. The trunk’s owner 
is a young African elephant. At only 8 years old, she still has 
a lot to learn about her home. Fortunately, she’s not alone. Elephants are extremely social creatures, with females living in tight-knit herds 
led by a single matriarch. And every member of the group 
has one of the most versatile tools in the savannah to help them get by. Today her herd is looking for water. Or, more accurately, smelling for water. Elephants have more genes devoted 
to smell than any other creature, making them the best sniffers
in the animal kingdom. Even at our elephant’s young age,
her trunk is already 1.5 meters long and contains five times as many 
olfactory receptors as a human nose, allowing her to smell standing water
several kilometers away. And now, the matriarch uses her own keen
sense of smell to plot the herd’s course. Their journey is long,
so our elephant keeps her energy up by snacking on the occasional patch 
of thick grass. But this light lunch 
isn’t just about staying fed— she’s also looking for clues. Like many other mammals, vents in the roof of an elephant’s mouth 
lead directly to the vomeronasal organ. This structure can detect chemical
signals left by other elephants. So as the herd forages, 
they’re also gathering information about what other herds have come this way. All the while, the group’s adults are 
on the lookout for signs of other animals, including potential threats. Fortunately, while lions might attack
a young or sickly elephant, few are foolish enough to take 
on a healthy adult. Weighing 3 tons and bearing powerful tusks
nearly a meter long, our elephant’s mother is a force
to be reckoned with. Her dexterous trunk doubles 
as a powerful, flexible arm. Containing no bones
and an estimated 40,000 muscles, these agile appendages 
can bend, twist, contract, and expand. At 8 years old, our elephant’s trunk
is already strong enough to move small fallen trees, while finger-like extensions allow for 
delicate maneuvers like wiping her eye. She can even grab a nearby branch, break it to just the right length,
and wave off pesky insects. Suddenly, the matriarch stops their march
and sniffs the air. Using smell alone, elephants can recognize
each member of their herd, and their exceptional memories can 
retain the smells of elephants outside their herd as well. It’s one of these old but familiar odors
that’s caught the matriarch’s attention. She bellows into the air, sending out a sound wave 
that rings across the savannah. But it travels even further
through the earth as infrasonic rumbles. Elephants up to 10 kilometers away can
receive these rumbles with their feet. If the matriarch’s nose is right,
her herd should expect a response. Smelling the secretions 
from her daughter’s temporal glands, our elephant’s mother can sense 
her daughter’s unease about this unfamiliar encounter. As the herd of unknown
elephants approaches, trunks from both herds rise into the air,
sounding trumpets of alarm. But upon recognition, apprehension 
quickly gives way to happy rumbles. Members from each herd recognize
each other despite time apart, and many investigate each other’s mouths
with their trunks to smell what their counterparts 
have been eating. With the reunion now in full swing, both
herds head toward their final destination: the long-awaited watering hole. Here, older elephants suck up to 8 liters 
of water into their trunks before spraying the contents 
on themselves to cool off. Meanwhile, our young elephant plays 
in the mud with her peers, digging into the muck 
and even using her trunk as a snorkel to breathe while submerged. The pair of matriarchs look 
contentedly on their herds, before turning their trunks 
to the horizon once more.

so our elephant keeps her energy up by snacking on the occasional patch 
of thick grass. But this light lunch 
isn’t just about staying fed— she’s also looking for clues. Like many other mammals, vents in the roof of an elephant’s mouth 
lead directly to the vomeronasal organ. This structure can detect chemical
signals left by other elephants. So as the herd forages, 
they’re also gathering information about what other herds have come this way. All the while, the group’s adults are 
on the lookout for signs of other animals, including potential threats. Fortunately, while lions might attack
a young or sickly elephant, few are foolish enough to take 
on a healthy adult. Weighing 3 tons and bearing powerful tusks
nearly a meter long, our elephant’s mother is a force
to be reckoned with. Her dexterous trunk doubles 
as a powerful, flexible arm. Containing no bones
and an estimated 40,000 muscles, these agile appendages 
can bend, twist, contract, and expand. At 8 years old, our elephant’s trunk
is already strong enough to move small fallen trees, while finger-like extensions allow for 
delicate maneuvers like wiping her eye. She can even grab a nearby branch, break it to just the right length,
and wave off pesky insects. Suddenly, the matriarch stops their march
and sniffs the air. Using smell alone, elephants can recognize
each member of their herd, and their exceptional memories can 
retain the smells of elephants outside their herd as well. It’s one of these old but familiar odors
that’s caught the matriarch’s attention. She bellows into the air, sending out a sound wave 
that rings across the savannah. But it travels even further
through the earth as infrasonic rumbles. Elephants up to 10 kilometers away can
receive these rumbles with their feet. If the matriarch’s nose is right,
her herd should expect a response. Smelling the secretions 
from her daughter’s temporal glands, our elephant’s mother can sense 
her daughter’s unease about this unfamiliar encounter. As the herd of unknown
elephants approaches, trunks from both herds rise into the air,
sounding trumpets of alarm. But upon recognition, apprehension 
quickly gives way to happy rumbles. Members from each herd recognize
each other despite time apart, and many investigate each other’s mouths
with their trunks to smell what their counterparts 
have been eating. With the reunion now in full swing, both
herds head toward their final destination: the long-awaited watering hole. Here, older elephants suck up to 8 liters 
of water into their trunks before spraying the contents 
on themselves to cool off. Meanwhile, our young elephant plays 
in the mud with her peers, digging into the muck 
and even using her trunk as a snorkel to breathe while submerged. The pair of matriarchs look 
contentedly on their herds, before turning their trunks 
to the horizon once more.

**Transcript**:
As a breeze blows through the savannah, a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air
and scans the horizon like a periscope. But it’s not seeing— 
it’s sniffing for odors like the scent of a watering hole 
or the musk of a dangerous predator. The trunk’s owner 
is a young African elephant. At only 8 years old, she still has 
a lot to learn about her home. Fortunately, she’s not alone. Elephants are extremely social creatures, with females living in tight-knit herds 
led by a single matriarch. And every member of the group 
has one of the most versatile tools in the savannah to help them get by. Today her herd is looking for water. Or, more accurately, smelling for water. Elephants have more genes devoted 
to smell than any other creature, making them the best sniffers
in the animal kingdom. Even at our elephant’s young age,
her trunk is already 1.5 meters long and contains five times as many 
olfactory receptors as a human nose, allowing her to smell standing water
several kilometers away. And now, the matriarch uses her own keen

**Transcript**:
Once each year, thousands of logicians
descend into the desert for Learning Man, a week-long event they attend
to share their ideas, think through tough problems...
and mostly to party. And at the center of that gathering 
is the world’s most exclusive club, where under the full moon, 
the annual logician’s rave takes place. The entry is guarded 
by the Demon of Reason, and the only way to get in is to solve
one of his dastardly challenges. You’re attending with 23 
of your closest logician friends, but you got lost on the way 
to the rave and arrived late. They're already inside, so you must
face down the demon alone. He poses you the following question: When your friends arrived,
the demon put masks on their faces and forbade them from communicating
in any way. No one at any point could
see their own masks, but they stood in a circle where they
could see everyone else’s. The demon told the logicians that he 
distributed the masks in such a way that each person would eventually be able 
to figure out their mask’s color using logic alone. Then, once every two minutes,
he rang a bell. At that point, anyone who could
come to him and tell him the color of their mask 
would be admitted. Here’s what happened: Four logicians got in at the first bell. Some number of logicians, all in red 
masks, got in at the second bell. Nobody got in when the third bell rang. Logicians wearing at least two different
colors got in at the fourth bell. All 23 of your friends played 
the game perfectly logically and eventually got inside. Your challenge, the demon explains, is to tell him how many people gained
entry when the fifth bell rang. Can you get into the rave? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s initially difficult to imagine 
how anyone could, using just logic and the colors
they see on the other masks, deduce their own mask color. But even before the first bell, everyone
will realize something critical. Let’s imagine a single logician
with a silver mask. When she looks around, she’d see 
multiple colors, but no silver. So she couldn’t ever know that silver 
is an option, making it impossible for her to logically 
deduce that she must be silver. That contradicts rule five, so there must
be at least two masks of each color. Now, let’s think about what happens when there are exactly two people wearing 
the same color mask. Each of them sees only one mask 
of that color. But because they already know 
that it can’t be the only one, they immediately know that their own mask 
is the other. This must be what happened
before the first bell: two pairs of logicians each realized
their own mask colors when they saw a unique color in the room. What happens if there are three people 
wearing the same color? Each of them—A, B and C—
sees two people with that color. From A’s perspective, B and C would be
expected to behave the same way that the orange and purple pairs did, 
leaving at the first bell. When that doesn’t happen, each of the three realizes that they are 
the third person with that color, and all three leave at the next bell. That was what the people 
with red masks did— so there must have been three of them. We’ve now established a basis 
for inductive reasoning. Induction is where we can solve 
the simplest case, then find a pattern that will allow 
the same reasoning to apply 
to successively larger sets. The pattern here is that everyone 
will know what group they’re in as soon as the previously sized group
has the opportunity to leave. After the second bell, 
there were 16 people. No one left on the third bell, so everyone then knew there weren’t 
any groups of four. Multiple groups,
which must have been of five, left on the fourth bell. Three groups would

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Once each year, thousands of logicians
descend into the desert for Learning Man, a week-long event they attend
to share their ideas, think through tough problems...
and mostly to party. And at the center of that gathering 
is the world’s most exclusive club, where under the full moon, 
the annual logician’s rave takes place. The entry is guarded 
by the Demon of Reason, and the only way to get in is to solve
one of his dastardly challenges. You’re attending with 23 
of your closest logician friends, but you got lost on the way 
to the rave and arrived late. They're already inside, so you must
face down the demon alone. He poses you the following question: When your friends arrived,
the demon put masks on their faces and forbade them from communicating
in any way. No one at any point could
see their own masks, but they stood in a circle where they
could see everyone else’s. The demon told the logicians that he 
distributed the masks in such a way that each person would eventually be able 
to figure out their mask’s color using logic alone. Then, once every two minutes,
he rang a bell. At that point, anyone who could
come to him and tell him the color of their mask 
would be admitted. Here’s what happened: Four logicians got in at the first bell. Some number of logicians, all in red 
masks, got in at the second bell. Nobody got in when the third bell rang. Logicians wearing at least two different
colors got in at the fourth bell. All 23 of your friends played 
the game perfectly logically and eventually got inside. Your challenge, the demon explains, is to tell him how many people gained
entry when the fifth bell rang. Can you get into the rave? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s initially difficult to imagine 
how anyone could, using just logic and the colors
they see on the other masks, deduce their own mask color. But even before the first bell, everyone
will realize something critical. Let’s imagine a single logician
with a silver mask. When she looks around, she’d see 
multiple colors, but no silver. So she couldn’t ever know that silver 
is an option, making it impossible for her to logically 
deduce that she must be silver. That contradicts rule five, so there must
be at least two masks of each color. Now, let’s think about what happens when there are exactly two people wearing 
the same color mask. Each of them sees only one mask 
of that color. But because they already know 
that it can’t be the only one, they immediately know that their own mask 
is the other. This must be what happened
before the first bell: two pairs of logicians each realized
their own mask colors when they saw a unique color in the room. What happens if there are three people 
wearing the same color? Each of them—A, B and C—
sees two people with that color. From A’s perspective, B and C would be
expected to behave the same way that the orange and purple pairs did, 
leaving at the first bell. When that doesn’t happen, each of the three realizes that they are 
the third person with that color, and all three leave at the next bell. That was what the people 
with red masks did— so there must have been three of them. We’ve now established a basis 
for inductive reasoning. Induction is where we can solve 
the simplest case, then find a pattern that will allow 
the same reasoning to apply 
to successively larger sets. The pattern here is that everyone 
will know what group they’re in as soon as the previously sized group
has the opportunity to leave. After the second bell, 
there were 16 people. No one left on the third bell, so everyone then knew there weren’t 
any groups of four. Multiple groups,
which must have been of five, left on the fourth bell. Three groups would
leave a solitary mask wearer, which isn’t possible, 
so it must’ve been two groups. And that leaves six logicians outside 
when the fifth bell rings: the answer to the demon’s riddle. Nothing left to do but join your friends 
and dance.

**Transcript**:
Here in this abundant forest, Malassezia is equipped with everything 
it could ever need. Feasting constantly, it’s in paradise. But wait— what’s this? In fact, Malassezia is a type of yeast 
that lives and dines on all of our scalps. And in about half of the human population,
its activity causes dandruff. So, why do some people have
more dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? We might consider ourselves individuals,
but we’re really colonies. Our skin hosts billions of microbes. Malassezia yeasts make themselves at home
on our skin shortly after we’re born. Follicles, the tiny cavities that grow
hairs all over our body, make for especially popular 
living quarters. Malassezia are fond of these hideouts
because they contain glands that secrete an oil called sebum that’s thought to lubricate 
and strengthen our hair. Malassezia evolved to consume 
our skin’s proteins and oils. And because of its many sebum-secreting 
follicles, our scalp is one of the oiliest places
on our body— and consequently, one of the yeastiest. As these fungi feast on our scalp’s oils,
dandruff may form. This is because sebum is composed of both
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fats neatly pack together. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, contain double bonds that create 
an irregular kink in their structure. Malassezia eat sebum by secreting
an enzyme that releases all of the oil’s 
fatty acids. But they only consume the saturated fats,
leaving the unsaturated ones behind. These irregularly shaped leftovers 
soak into the skin and pry its barrier open,
allowing water to escape. The body detects these breaches 
and responds defensively, causing the inflammation 
that gives dandruff it’s itch. It also makes the skin cells proliferate
to repair the damaged barrier. Usually, our skin’s outer surface, 
or epidermis, completely renews itself 
every two to three weeks, Epidermal cells divide, 
move outwards, die, and form the skin’s tough outer layer, which gradually sheds off in single cells 
far too small to see. But with dandruff, cells churn out quickly
to correct the broken barrier, meaning they don’t mature 
and differentiate properly. Instead, they form large, greasy clumps
around the hair follicle that are shed as visible flakes. This is how Malassezia’s 
voracious appetite and our bodies reaction 
to its by-products lead to dandruff. Currently, the most effective way to get
rid of dandruff is by using antifungals 
in things like shampoos, applied directly to the scalp, 
to kill Malassezia. For those who experience dandruff, it usually comes and goes as sebum
secretions vary throughout one's lifetime due to hormonal changes. But despite the fact that Malassezia 
colonize everyone to a similar extent, not everyone gets dandruff. Some people are more susceptible. Exactly why is unclear. Do people with dandruff have a certain 
genetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating 
if people with dandruff do, in fact, lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what’s leading 
their skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that Malassezia
communicate with our immune system using small, oily molecules called 
oxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit
inflammatory oxylipins and boost anti-inflammatory ones, 
they could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating 
if there’s any benefit to our relationship with Malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable
and embarrassing for us, creates a reliable, oily 
food source for the yeast. But dandruff isn’t contagious 
or a great threat to our health. And Malassezia seem to excel
at defending their territory, our skin, from other, more harmful microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus. So, while scientists have gotten 
to the bottom of many mysteries surrounding this condition,
it must be said: dandruff remains a head-scratcher.

genetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating 
if people with dandruff do, in fact, lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what’s leading 
their skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that Malassezia
communicate with our immune system using small, oily molecules called 
oxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit
inflammatory oxylipins and boost anti-inflammatory ones, 
they could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating 
if there’s any benefit to our relationship with Malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable
and embarrassing for us, creates a reliable, oily 
food source for the yeast. But dandruff isn’t contagious 
or a great threat to our health. And Malassezia seem to excel
at defending their territory, our skin, from other, more harmful microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus. So, while scientists have gotten 
to the bottom of many mysteries surrounding this condition,
it must be said: dandruff remains a head-scratcher.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1860s, scientists believed
they were on the verge of uncovering the brain’s biggest secret. They already knew the brain controlled
the body through electrical impulses. The question was, how did these signals
travel through the body without changing or degrading? It seemed that perfectly transmitting 
these impulses would require them to travel uninterrupted
along some kind of tissue. This idea, called reticular theory, imagined the nervous system 
as a massive web of tissue that physically connected 
every nerve cell in the body. Reticular theory captivated the field
with its elegant simplicity. But soon, a young artist would cut through
this conjecture, and sketch a bold new vision 
of how our brains work. 60 years before reticular theory was born, developments in microscope technology revealed cells to be the building blocks 
of organic tissue. This finding was revolutionary, but early microscopes struggled
to provide additional details. The technology was especially challenging
for researchers studying the brain. Soft nervous tissue was
delicate and difficult to work with. And even when researchers were able
to get it under the microscope, the tissue was so densely packed 
it was impossible to see much. To improve their view, scientists began experimenting 
with special staining techniques designed to provide clarity 
through contrast. The most effective came courtesy
of Camillo Golgi in 1873. First, Golgi hardened the brain tissue 
with potassium bichromate to prevent cells from deforming 
during handling. Then he doused the tissue 
in silver nitrate, which visibly accumulated in nerve cells. Known as the “black reaction,” Golgi’s Method finally allowed researchers
to see the entire cell body of what would later be named the neuron. The stain even highlighted 
the fibrous branches that shot off from the cell 
in different directions. Images of these branches
became hazy at the ends, making it difficult to determine exactly
how they fit into the larger network. But Golgi concluded that these
branches connected, forming a web of tissue comprising
the entire nervous system. 14 years later, a young scientist
and aspiring artist named Santiago Ramón y Cajal 
began to build on Golgi’s work. While writing a book 
about microscopic imaging, he came across a picture of a cell
treated with Golgi’s stain. Cajal was in awe of its exquisite detail—
both as a scientist and an artist. He soon set out to improve
Golgi’s stain even further and create more detailed references
for his artwork. By staining the tissue twice
in a specific time frame, Cajal found he could stain a greater
number of neurons with better resolution. And what these new slides revealed
would upend reticular theory— the branches reaching out 
from each nerve cell were not physically connected 
to any other tissue. So how were these individual cells 
transmitting electrical signals? By studying and sketching
them countless times, Cajal developed a bold, new hypothesis. Instead of electrical signals traveling
uninterrupted across a network of fibers, he proposed that signals were somehow
jumping from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation. The idea that electrical signals could
travel this way was completely unheard of when Cajal proposed it in 1889. However his massive collection of drawings
supported his hypothesis from every angle. And in the mid-1900s, electron microscopy
further supported this idea by revealing a membrane 
around each nerve cell keeping it separate from its neighbors. This formed the basis 
of the “neuron doctrine,” which proposed the brain’s tissue 
was made up of many discrete cells, instead of one connected tissue. The neuron doctrine laid the foundation 
for modern neuroscience, and allowed later researchers to discover 
that electrical impulses are constantly converted between
chemical and electrical signals as they travel from neuron to neuron. Both Golgi and Cajal received 
the Nobel Prize for their separate, 
but shared discoveries, and researchers still apply 
their theories and methods today. In this way, their legacies remain
connected as discrete elements in a vast network of knowledge.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1860s, scientists believed
they were on the verge of uncovering the brain’s biggest secret. They already knew the brain controlled
the body through electrical impulses. The question was, how did these signals
travel through the body without changing or degrading? It seemed that perfectly transmitting 
these impulses would require them to travel uninterrupted
along some kind of tissue. This idea, called reticular theory, imagined the nervous system 
as a massive web of tissue that physically connected 
every nerve cell in the body. Reticular theory captivated the field
with its elegant simplicity. But soon, a young artist would cut through
this conjecture, and sketch a bold new vision 
of how our brains work. 60 years before reticular theory was born, developments in microscope technology revealed cells to be the building blocks 
of organic tissue. This finding was revolutionary, but early microscopes struggled
to provide additional details. The technology was especially challenging
for researchers studying the brain. Soft nervous tissue was
delicate and difficult to work with. And even when researchers were able
to get it under the microscope, the tissue was so densely packed 
it was impossible to see much. To improve their view, scientists began experimenting 
with special staining techniques designed to provide clarity 
through contrast. The most effective came courtesy
of Camillo Golgi in 1873. First, Golgi hardened the brain tissue 
with potassium bichromate to prevent cells from deforming 
during handling. Then he doused the tissue 
in silver nitrate, which visibly accumulated in nerve cells. Known as the “black reaction,” Golgi’s Method finally allowed researchers
to see the entire cell body of what would later be named the neuron. The stain even highlighted 
the fibrous branches that shot off from the cell 
in different directions. Images of these branches
became hazy at the ends, making it difficult to determine exactly
how they fit into the larger network. But Golgi concluded that these
branches connected, forming a web of tissue comprising
the entire nervous system. 14 years later, a young scientist
and aspiring artist named Santiago Ramón y Cajal 
began to build on Golgi’s work. While writing a book 
about microscopic imaging, he came across a picture of a cell
treated with Golgi’s stain. Cajal was in awe of its exquisite detail—
both as a scientist and an artist. He soon set out to improve
Golgi’s stain even further and create more detailed references
for his artwork. By staining the tissue twice
in a specific time frame, Cajal found he could stain a greater
number of neurons with better resolution. And what these new slides revealed
would upend reticular theory— the branches reaching out 
from each nerve cell were not physically connected 
to any other tissue. So how were these individual cells 
transmitting electrical signals? By studying and sketching
them countless times, Cajal developed a bold, new hypothesis. Instead of electrical signals traveling
uninterrupted across a network of fibers, he proposed that signals were somehow
jumping from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation. The idea that electrical signals could
travel this way was completely unheard of when Cajal proposed it in 1889. However his massive collection of drawings
supported his hypothesis from every angle. And in the mid-1900s, electron microscopy
further supported this idea by revealing a membrane 
around each nerve cell keeping it separate from its neighbors. This formed the basis 
of the “neuron doctrine,” which proposed the brain’s tissue 
was made up of many discrete cells, instead of one connected tissue. The neuron doctrine laid the foundation 
for modern neuroscience, and allowed later researchers to discover 
that electrical impulses are constantly converted between
chemical and electrical signals as they travel from neuron to neuron. Both Golgi and Cajal received 
the Nobel Prize for their separate, 
but shared discoveries, and researchers still apply 
their theories and methods today. In this way, their legacies remain
connected as discrete elements in a vast network of knowledge.

**Transcript**:
In 1984, two field workers discovered 
a body in a bog outside Cheshire, England. Officials named the body the Lindow Man and determined that he’d suffered 
serious injuries, including blunt trauma and strangulation. But the most shocking thing 
about this gruesome story was that they were able to determine these
details from a body over 2,000 years old. Typically, decomposition would make
such injuries hard to detect on a body buried just weeks earlier. So why was this corpse 
so perfectly preserved? And why don't all bodies
stay in this condition? The answers to these questions
live six feet underground. It may not appear very lively down here, but a single teaspoon of soil 
contains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae 
to fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth’s
biodiversity. And perhaps the soil’s most important 
inhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger 
than several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet’s 
dead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin
breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume
and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition
sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present
depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields
there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down 
grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest 
there are more fungi, capable of breaking down 
complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food
from the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction
called oxidation. This breaks down the molecules 
of organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients 
in a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon
and some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, 
sulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat
more of the apple, they expose more surface area 
for these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind
are mined by microbes. This continues until the apple
is reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two
months in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet 
support more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things
more quickly. And less complex organic materials 
break down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced 
to microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules
are too strong to break down any further. So instead, 
these nutrients feed plant life, which grow more food that will
eventually decompose. This constant cycle of creating and 
decomposing supports all life on Earth. But there are a few environments too
hostile for these multi-talented microbes— including the peat bogs 
outside Cheshire, England. Peat bogs are mostly made of highly
acidic Sphagnum mosses. These plants acidify the soil
while also releasing a compound that binds to nitrogen, 
depriving the area of nutrients. Alongside cold 
northern European temperatures, these conditions make it impossible 
for most microbes to function. With nothing to break them down, the dead mosses pile up, 
preventing oxygen from entering the bog. The result is a naturally sealed system. Whatever organic matter enters a peat bog
just sits there— like the Lindow Man. The acid of the bog was strong enough to dissolve relatively simple material 
like bone, and it turned more complex tissue 
like skin and organs pitch black. But his corpse is otherwise 
so well-preserved, that we can determine 
he was healthy, mid-20s, and potentially wealthy 
as his body shows few signs of hard labor. We even know the Lindow Man’s last meal— a still undigested piece of charred bread. Scholars are less certain about 
the circumstances of his death. While cold-blooded murder
is a possibility, the extremity of his injuries
suggest a ritual sacrifice. Even 2,000 years ago, there’s evidence the bog was known 
for its almost supernatural qualities; a place where the soil beneath your feet 
wasn’t quite dead or alive.

from the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction
called oxidation. This breaks down the molecules 
of organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients 
in a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon
and some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, 
sulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat
more of the apple, they expose more surface area 
for these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind
are mined by microbes. This continues until the apple
is reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two
months in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet 
support more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things
more quickly. And less complex organic materials 
break down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced 
to microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules
are too strong to break down any further. So instead, 
these nutrients feed plant life, which grow more food that will
eventually decompose. This constant cycle of creating and 
decomposing supports all life on Earth. But there are a few environments too
hostile for these multi-talented microbes— including the peat bogs 
outside Cheshire, England. Peat bogs are mostly made of highly
acidic Sphagnum mosses. These plants acidify the soil
while also releasing a compound that binds to nitrogen, 
depriving the area of nutrients. Alongside cold 
northern European temperatures, these conditions make it impossible 
for most microbes to function. With nothing to break them down, the dead mosses pile up, 
preventing oxygen from entering the bog. The result is a naturally sealed system. Whatever organic matter enters a peat bog
just sits there— like the Lindow Man. The acid of the bog was strong enough to dissolve relatively simple material 
like bone, and it turned more complex tissue 
like skin and organs pitch black. But his corpse is otherwise 
so well-preserved, that we can determine 
he was healthy, mid-20s, and potentially wealthy 
as his body shows few signs of hard labor. We even know the Lindow Man’s last meal— a still undigested piece of charred bread. Scholars are less certain about 
the circumstances of his death. While cold-blooded murder
is a possibility, the extremity of his injuries
suggest a ritual sacrifice. Even 2,000 years ago, there’s evidence the bog was known 
for its almost supernatural qualities; a place where the soil beneath your feet 
wasn’t quite dead or alive.

**Transcript**:
In 1984, two field workers discovered 
a body in a bog outside Cheshire, England. Officials named the body the Lindow Man and determined that he’d suffered 
serious injuries, including blunt trauma and strangulation. But the most shocking thing 
about this gruesome story was that they were able to determine these
details from a body over 2,000 years old. Typically, decomposition would make
such injuries hard to detect on a body buried just weeks earlier. So why was this corpse 
so perfectly preserved? And why don't all bodies
stay in this condition? The answers to these questions
live six feet underground. It may not appear very lively down here, but a single teaspoon of soil 
contains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae 
to fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth’s
biodiversity. And perhaps the soil’s most important 
inhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger 
than several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet’s 
dead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin
breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume
and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition
sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present
depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields
there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down 
grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest 
there are more fungi, capable of breaking down 
complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food
from the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction
called oxidation. This breaks down the molecules 
of organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients 
in a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon
and some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, 
sulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat
more of the apple, they expose more surface area 
for these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind
are mined by microbes. This continues until the apple
is reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two
months in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet 
support more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things
more quickly. And less complex organic materials 
break down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced 
to microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules

**Transcript**:
One day, without warning
or apparent cause, all of humanity’s artificial satellites
suddenly disappear. The first to understand the situation are a handful of government 
and commercial operators. But well before they have time 
to process what’s happened, millions sitting on their couches become
aware that something is amiss. TV that’s broadcast from or routed 
through satellites dominate the market for international programming 
as well as some local channels, so the disappearance causes immediate
disruptions, worldwide. The next people affected are those
traveling by air, sea, or land, as global positioning, navigation 
and timing services, have entirely ceased. Pilots, captains, and drivers 
have to determine their locations using analog instruments and maps. Aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles get 
stopped, grounded, or returned to port. In the meantime, air traffic controllers
have a difficult task on their hands to prevent plane crashes. Within hours, most of the planet’s traffic
grinds to a halt. The effects aren’t limited 
to entertainment and travel. All sorts of machines, from heating 
and cooling systems to assembly lines, rely on super-accurate 
satellite-based timing systems, and many have little-to-no backup options. Stoplights and other traffic control
systems stop synchronizing, so police and good Samaritans 
step in to direct the remaining cars and prevent as many accidents as possible. The most catastrophic impact 
is yet to come. Because in the next few hours, 
the world economy shuts down. Satellite-based timestamps 
play a critical part in everything from credit card readers 
and stock exchanges to the systems that keep track
of transactions. People are unable to withdraw cash
or make electronic payments. Logistics and supply chains for crucial
goods like food and medicine fragment, leaving people to survive on whatever
is locally available. Most countries declare 
a state of emergency and call on the military to restore order. That may take quite a while. Most navigation and communication systems
are no longer operational, so military chains of command
may be in disarray. Many troops, including those actively
deployed, are left to their own devices. Commanders of nuclear submarines 
and missile control centers wonder if the disruption is the result
of a hostile attack. What sorts of decisions do they make 
with partial information? Even in the best-case scenario, our civilization gets set back by decades 
at the very least. That’s because, despite
being a relatively new phenomenon, satellites have quickly replaced more
traditional long range technologies. The combination of global positioning
and internet has allowed for near-instant signals 
that can be synchronized worldwide. Many systems we use daily 
have been built upon this foundation. Going back to the communication systems
of the mid-20th century would not be a simple matter. In many cases, they’d have to be rebuilt
from the ground up. While the sudden disappearance 
in this thought experiment is unlikely, there are two very real scenarios 
that could lead to the same results. The first is a solar flare so strong
it fries satellite circuitry– as well as many other devices 
and power grids around the world. And the second is an orbital chain
reaction of collisions. With about 7,500 metric tons 
of defunct spacecraft, spent boosters, and discarded equipment 
orbiting our planet at relative speeds 
up to 56,000 kilometers per hour, even small objects can be
highly destructive. A single collision in space could create
thousands of new pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction. Space is huge, but many of the thousands
of satellites currently in orbit share the same orbital highways 
for their specific purposes. And since most objects sent to space 
are not designed with disposal in mind, these highways only become
more congested over time. The good news is, we can protect ourselves
by studying our solar system, creating backup options 
for our satellite networks, and cooperating to avoid 
an orbital tragedy of the commons. The space kilometers above our heads
is like our forests, the ocean’s biodiversity and clean air: If we don't treat it as a finite resource, we may wake up one day to find
we no longer have it at all.

**Transcript**:
One day, without warning
or apparent cause, all of humanity’s artificial satellites
suddenly disappear. The first to understand the situation are a handful of government 
and commercial operators. But well before they have time 
to process what’s happened, millions sitting on their couches become
aware that something is amiss. TV that’s broadcast from or routed 
through satellites dominate the market for international programming 
as well as some local channels, so the disappearance causes immediate
disruptions, worldwide. The next people affected are those
traveling by air, sea, or land, as global positioning, navigation 
and timing services, have entirely ceased. Pilots, captains, and drivers 
have to determine their locations using analog instruments and maps. Aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles get 
stopped, grounded, or returned to port. In the meantime, air traffic controllers
have a difficult task on their hands to prevent plane crashes. Within hours, most of the planet’s traffic
grinds to a halt. The effects aren’t limited 
to entertainment and travel. All sorts of machines, from heating 
and cooling systems to assembly lines, rely on super-accurate 
satellite-based timing systems, and many have little-to-no backup options. Stoplights and other traffic control
systems stop synchronizing, so police and good Samaritans 
step in to direct the remaining cars and prevent as many accidents as possible. The most catastrophic impact 
is yet to come. Because in the next few hours, 
the world economy shuts down. Satellite-based timestamps 
play a critical part in everything from credit card readers 
and stock exchanges to the systems that keep track
of transactions. People are unable to withdraw cash
or make electronic payments. Logistics and supply chains for crucial
goods like food and medicine fragment, leaving people to survive on whatever
is locally available. Most countries declare 
a state of emergency and call on the military to restore order. That may take quite a while. Most navigation and communication systems
are no longer operational, so military chains of command
may be in disarray. Many troops, including those actively
deployed, are left to their own devices. Commanders of nuclear submarines 
and missile control centers wonder if the disruption is the result
of a hostile attack. What sorts of decisions do they make 
with partial information? Even in the best-case scenario, our civilization gets set back by decades 
at the very least. That’s because, despite
being a relatively new phenomenon, satellites have quickly replaced more
traditional long range technologies. The combination of global positioning
and internet has allowed for near-instant signals 
that can be synchronized worldwide. Many systems we use daily 
have been built upon this foundation. Going back to the communication systems
of the mid-20th century would not be a simple matter. In many cases, they’d have to be rebuilt
from the ground up. While the sudden disappearance 
in this thought experiment is unlikely, there are two very real scenarios 
that could lead to the same results. The first is a solar flare so strong
it fries satellite circuitry– as well as many other devices 
and power grids around the world. And the second is an orbital chain
reaction of collisions. With about 7,500 metric tons 
of defunct spacecraft, spent boosters, and discarded equipment 
orbiting our planet at relative speeds 
up to 56,000 kilometers per hour, even small objects can be
highly destructive. A single collision in space could create
thousands of new pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction. Space is huge, but many of the thousands
of satellites currently in orbit share the same orbital highways 
for their specific purposes. And since most objects sent to space 
are not designed with disposal in mind, these highways only become
more congested over time. The good news is, we can protect ourselves
by studying our solar system, creating backup options 
for our satellite networks, and cooperating to avoid 
an orbital tragedy of the commons. The space kilometers above our heads
is like our forests, the ocean’s biodiversity and clean air: If we don't treat it as a finite resource, we may wake up one day to find
we no longer have it at all.

**Transcript**:
The earliest known divorce
laws were written on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia
around 2000 BCE. Formally or informally, human societies 
across place and time have made rules 
to bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,
started with a trial partnership, during which a man could send 
his partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,
there was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, 
divorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners
with a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,
and why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some
of society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,
individual rights, and women’s rights. Religious authorities have often
regulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife 
without cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s
agreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled
divorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church
banning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing
it in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. In the late 18th century,
a series of changes took place that would eventually shape 
divorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance
separate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over
education, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first
of the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce 
for a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, 
and desertion, or simply mutual consent. Though progress was uneven, overall this
sort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European
colonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often
remained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more
serious for women— a man could divorce his wife
for adultery alone, while a woman would need
evidence of adultery, plus an additional offense
to divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard
was written into law; other times, the courts enforced
the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental
ideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one
person wronged the other in specific ways. This state of affairs really overstayed
its welcome. Well into the 20th century,
couples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed
with one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos
as evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted 
no-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse 
without proving harm, and importantly, 
without the other’s consent. The transition from cultural 
and religious rules to state sanctioned ones 
has always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored
their governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t 
recognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws
have been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce 
according to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow
for equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,
or community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain
people, almost always women. And even in the places where women 
aren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make
divorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss 
far more than men after divorce. At its best, modern no-fault divorce
allows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage 
is almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects 
of a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically 
complex issues.

the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental
ideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one
person wronged the other in specific ways. This state of affairs really overstayed
its welcome. Well into the 20th century,
couples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed
with one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos
as evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted 
no-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse 
without proving harm, and importantly, 
without the other’s consent. The transition from cultural 
and religious rules to state sanctioned ones 
has always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored
their governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t 
recognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws
have been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce 
according to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow
for equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,
or community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain
people, almost always women. And even in the places where women 
aren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make
divorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss 
far more than men after divorce. At its best, modern no-fault divorce
allows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage 
is almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects 
of a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically

**Transcript**:
The earliest known divorce
laws were written on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia
around 2000 BCE. Formally or informally, human societies 
across place and time have made rules 
to bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,
started with a trial partnership, during which a man could send 
his partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,
there was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, 
divorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners
with a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,
and why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some
of society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,
individual rights, and women’s rights. Religious authorities have often
regulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife 
without cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s
agreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled
divorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church
banning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing
it in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. In the late 18th century,
a series of changes took place that would eventually shape 
divorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance
separate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over
education, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first
of the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce 
for a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, 
and desertion, or simply mutual consent. Though progress was uneven, overall this
sort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European
colonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often
remained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more
serious for women— a man could divorce his wife
for adultery alone, while a woman would need
evidence of adultery, plus an additional offense
to divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard
was written into law; other times, the courts enforced
the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1947, six Scandinavian
explorers noticed a strange phenomenon while crossing the Pacific Ocean. Somehow, small squid 
known to live deep beneath the waves kept appearing on the roof of their boat. The crew was mystified— until they saw the squids soaring
above the sea for roughly 50 meters. On land, people could barely believe
the explorers. It seemed impossible that sea creatures
without wings or bones could fly at all, let alone travel half the length 
of a football field. But over the next several decades,
more reports began to surface. Sailors described airborne squid keeping
pace with motor boats. Researchers reported captive squid
escaping their tanks overnight. And as cameras became widespread,
seafarers finally began capturing proof of these high-flying cephalopods. But how and why do 
these marine creatures take to the sky? While only a few squid species 
have been recorded taking flight, most squid are alike in the way 
they traverse the ocean. The outside of a squid’s body is a massive
tube of muscle called the mantle. Water enters that tube through small
openings around the squid’s head. Then, muscles clamp 
these openings shut, and the squid forcefully pumps the water
through the base of their body. In practice, this makes the mantle
a miniature jetpack, propelling squid through the water 
at 10 kilometers per hour. This process is also how squid breathe. Squid gills rest inside the mantle, and siphon oxygen from the water
being pushed past them. With gills full of air 
and a mantle full of water, squid can outpace predators 
and pursue their prey. Or, in the case of some species, they can 
smash through the ocean’s surface, and attempt an epic flight. Without the resistance of water, a squid’s acceleration 
is the same as a car going from zero to 100 kilometers 
per hour in just over a second. At speeds of 40 kilometers per hour, 
squid quickly generate aerodynamic lift. But to stay in the air they’ll need
something like wings. Fortunately, our soaring cephalopod
has a plan. Squid tentacles are "muscular hydrostats,"
meaning the tissue can be held firm by muscle tension. Splaying its tentacles 
in a rigid formation, the squid transforms them 
into flexible wing-like structures that stabilise its flight. At the opposite end of its body, two fins
typically used for gentle swimming find new purpose as a second set of wings. And by folding these fins down, a squid can streamline itself
and dip back into the ocean. There have been too few observations to establish what a squid’s 
typical flight trajectory looks like. Based on their flying speed, 
a 10 centimeter squid could hypothetically launch itself 
six meters above the water. But from what scientists have seen,
flying squid tend to glide low, keeping close to the surface. This trajectory allows squid to cover
the most horizontal distance possible over a typical several second flight. It also makes it easy to dive back 
into the water for more fuel— or to make a quick escape 
from predatory birds. But why do squids fly at all? Leading theories suggest that flight
is an escape behaviour, as flying squid generally seem 
to be fleeing a nearby predator or ship. Other researchers think their flight may be an energy-saving
migration strategy, because it takes less energy to move
quickly through the air than through water. However, it’s also possible
that learning to fly may be a vital part
of surviving adolescence. Young, smaller squid can potentially
fly faster and farther than their larger relatives. And since adult squid tend 
to cannibalize juveniles, soaring above the surf can help ensure
these young squid will live to fly another day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1947, six Scandinavian
explorers noticed a strange phenomenon while crossing the Pacific Ocean. Somehow, small squid 
known to live deep beneath the waves kept appearing on the roof of their boat. The crew was mystified— until they saw the squids soaring
above the sea for roughly 50 meters. On land, people could barely believe
the explorers. It seemed impossible that sea creatures
without wings or bones could fly at all, let alone travel half the length 
of a football field. But over the next several decades,
more reports began to surface. Sailors described airborne squid keeping
pace with motor boats. Researchers reported captive squid
escaping their tanks overnight. And as cameras became widespread,
seafarers finally began capturing proof of these high-flying cephalopods. But how and why do 
these marine creatures take to the sky? While only a few squid species 
have been recorded taking flight, most squid are alike in the way 
they traverse the ocean. The outside of a squid’s body is a massive
tube of muscle called the mantle. Water enters that tube through small
openings around the squid’s head. Then, muscles clamp 
these openings shut, and the squid forcefully pumps the water
through the base of their body. In practice, this makes the mantle
a miniature jetpack, propelling squid through the water 
at 10 kilometers per hour. This process is also how squid breathe. Squid gills rest inside the mantle, and siphon oxygen from the water
being pushed past them. With gills full of air 
and a mantle full of water, squid can outpace predators 
and pursue their prey. Or, in the case of some species, they can 
smash through the ocean’s surface, and attempt an epic flight. Without the resistance of water, a squid’s acceleration 
is the same as a car going from zero to 100 kilometers 
per hour in just over a second. At speeds of 40 kilometers per hour, 
squid quickly generate aerodynamic lift. But to stay in the air they’ll need
something like wings. Fortunately, our soaring cephalopod
has a plan. Squid tentacles are "muscular hydrostats,"
meaning the tissue can be held firm by muscle tension. Splaying its tentacles 
in a rigid formation, the squid transforms them 
into flexible wing-like structures that stabilise its flight. At the opposite end of its body, two fins
typically used for gentle swimming find new purpose as a second set of wings. And by folding these fins down, a squid can streamline itself
and dip back into the ocean. There have been too few observations to establish what a squid’s 
typical flight trajectory looks like. Based on their flying speed, 
a 10 centimeter squid could hypothetically launch itself 
six meters above the water. But from what scientists have seen,
flying squid tend to glide low, keeping close to the surface. This trajectory allows squid to cover
the most horizontal distance possible over a typical several second flight. It also makes it easy to dive back 
into the water for more fuel— or to make a quick escape 
from predatory birds. But why do squids fly at all? Leading theories suggest that flight
is an escape behaviour, as flying squid generally seem 
to be fleeing a nearby predator or ship. Other researchers think their flight may be an energy-saving
migration strategy, because it takes less energy to move
quickly through the air than through water. However, it’s also possible
that learning to fly may be a vital part
of surviving adolescence. Young, smaller squid can potentially
fly faster and farther than their larger relatives. And since adult squid tend 
to cannibalize juveniles, soaring above the surf can help ensure
these young squid will live to fly another day.

**Transcript**:
According to legend,
in the 27th century BCE, the Yellow Emperor of China charged
his historian, Cangjie, to develop a system of writing. Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie
noticed the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created
the first Chinese characters. And that night, the sky rained millet
while ghosts cried, fearing their actions may now be
condemned by the written word. We can’t say for sure whether
the story is true. But the earliest artifacts containing
Chinese characters date to the Shang Dynasty,
around 1250 to 1050 BCE, still making it one of the earliest
forms of written language. Characters etched on ox bones
and turtle shells show Shang kings’ writings
to their ancestors, discussing everything from agriculture
to the origins of a toothache. And as the legend suggests, these ancient characters
were mainly pictograms, or symbols that resemble
what they’re meant to represent. Even today, some of the most foundational
Chinese characters remain pictographic, like rén (人), which means person,
and mù (木), which means wood or tree. Some characters are ideograms, or
symbols that represent abstract concepts, like the numbers yī (一),
èr (二), and sān (三). Others are compound ideograms, which combine two or more
pictograms or ideograms. For example, xiū (休) places
the character for person next to the character for tree
and means to rest. However, most modern-day characters
are known as logograms, and are constructed of two components:
a radical component, which gestures at the meaning
of the character, and a sound component,
which hints at its pronunciation. And all characters are built
from a variety of strokes, which are often simplified
to eight basic types. There are 214 radicals,
each with its own definition. Some can stand alone, while others cannot. For instance, the radical rì (日),
written on its own means sun. It’s also used in characters
with sun-related definitions, such as xiǎo (晓) meaning dawn. The radical cǎo (艹), on the other hand,
never stands alone, but can be found within characters related
to grass and plants, like huā (花) meaning flower. And the radical shuǐ (水), meaning water,
always stands alone, but has a variant (氵) that is used when
it’s part of more complex characters like hé (河), meaning river. Radicals can appear
in different positions: to the left, to the right, above, below, or even surrounding the rest
of the character. There are many more sound components
than radicals, with estimates ranging in the thousands. Similar sounding words often share
the same sound component, and their radicals help shed light
on their meanings. Take fēng (峰) and fēng (蜂). The radical shān (山) means mountain, which hints at the first
character’s definition: summit. The radical in the second character,
chóng (虫), means insect, and together with the sound component
means bee. While many words in Chinese sound similar,
just like in other languages, context or tonality helps
clarify their meaning. Yet how each character is pronounced
depends on dialect, which varies across the country. So conversations in Chengdu may sound
vastly different than in Nanjing, but in both places,
the written language is the same. And unlike the romance languages, Chinese has no gendered nouns
or verb conjugations. So the character chī (吃), meaning to eat,
remains unchanged whether the subject is yourself,
a coworker, or a lesion of fearful ghosts. To indicate the past, a marker
like le (了) can be added. So “I eat bread” becomes “I ate bread.” Over the years, the Chinese writing
system has undergone many changes. As characters went from being
etched in bone, to cast in bronze, to brushed on paper, their script has evolved along the way. In the 1950s and 60s,
the Chinese Communist Party introduced new simplified versions
of the traditional characters, which are now standard in China, though traditional characters remain
in use in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And while the Chinese character
system may seem unique, its development greatly influenced
the spoken languages and writing systems of its neighbors. For example, around 60% of Japanese
dictionary entries are kanji— characters that originated in Chinese
or were created from its elements. With a 3,000 year history, Chinese characters have and will
continue to leave their mark.

and mù (木), which means wood or tree. Some characters are ideograms, or
symbols that represent abstract concepts, like the numbers yī (一),
èr (二), and sān (三). Others are compound ideograms, which combine two or more
pictograms or ideograms. For example, xiū (休) places
the character for person next to the character for tree
and means to rest. However, most modern-day characters
are known as logograms, and are constructed of two components:
a radical component, which gestures at the meaning
of the character, and a sound component,
which hints at its pronunciation. And all characters are built
from a variety of strokes, which are often simplified
to eight basic types. There are 214 radicals,
each with its own definition. Some can stand alone, while others cannot. For instance, the radical rì (日),
written on its own means sun. It’s also used in characters
with sun-related definitions, such as xiǎo (晓) meaning dawn. The radical cǎo (艹), on the other hand,
never stands alone, but can be found within characters related
to grass and plants, like huā (花) meaning flower. And the radical shuǐ (水), meaning water,
always stands alone, but has a variant (氵) that is used when
it’s part of more complex characters like hé (河), meaning river. Radicals can appear
in different positions: to the left, to the right, above, below, or even surrounding the rest
of the character. There are many more sound components
than radicals, with estimates ranging in the thousands. Similar sounding words often share
the same sound component, and their radicals help shed light
on their meanings. Take fēng (峰) and fēng (蜂). The radical shān (山) means mountain, which hints at the first
character’s definition: summit. The radical in the second character,
chóng (虫), means insect, and together with the sound component
means bee. While many words in Chinese sound similar,
just like in other languages, context or tonality helps
clarify their meaning. Yet how each character is pronounced
depends on dialect, which varies across the country. So conversations in Chengdu may sound
vastly different than in Nanjing, but in both places,
the written language is the same. And unlike the romance languages, Chinese has no gendered nouns
or verb conjugations. So the character chī (吃), meaning to eat,
remains unchanged whether the subject is yourself,
a coworker, or a lesion of fearful ghosts. To indicate the past, a marker
like le (了) can be added. So “I eat bread” becomes “I ate bread.” Over the years, the Chinese writing
system has undergone many changes. As characters went from being
etched in bone, to cast in bronze, to brushed on paper, their script has evolved along the way. In the 1950s and 60s,
the Chinese Communist Party introduced new simplified versions
of the traditional characters, which are now standard in China, though traditional characters remain
in use in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And while the Chinese character
system may seem unique, its development greatly influenced
the spoken languages and writing systems of its neighbors. For example, around 60% of Japanese
dictionary entries are kanji— characters that originated in Chinese
or were created from its elements. With a 3,000 year history, Chinese characters have and will
continue to leave their mark.

**Transcript**:
According to legend,
in the 27th century BCE, the Yellow Emperor of China charged
his historian, Cangjie, to develop a system of writing. Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie
noticed the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created
the first Chinese characters. And that night, the sky rained millet
while ghosts cried, fearing their actions may now be
condemned by the written word. We can’t say for sure whether
the story is true. But the earliest artifacts containing
Chinese characters date to the Shang Dynasty,
around 1250 to 1050 BCE, still making it one of the earliest
forms of written language. Characters etched on ox bones
and turtle shells show Shang kings’ writings
to their ancestors, discussing everything from agriculture
to the origins of a toothache. And as the legend suggests, these ancient characters
were mainly pictograms, or symbols that resemble

**Transcript**:
Though Oedipus would dodge death,
vanquish the monstrous Sphinx, and whether wrathful plagues, the truth would prove
his greatest challenger. When Oedipus’ mother,
Queen Jocasta of Thebes, gave birth to him,
a grim heir seized the occasion. Her husband, King Laius, had received
a prophecy from Apollo’s oracle foretelling that he would die
at the hands of his own son. Determined to escape this fate,
Laius had the newborn’s ankles pierced, and Jocasta ordered a shepherd to abandon
him on Mount Cithaeron to perish. But divine prophecies
can be quite stubborn. The shepherd took pity on the baby
and gave him to to another shepherd— this one from Corinth. He decided to bring the baby to the
childless Corinthian king and queen, Polybus and Merope. They called the boy Oedipus,
or “swollen-foot,” and raised him as their own,
never revealing his true origin. Years passed, till one night, a drunken reveler told Oedipus that he was
not Polybus and Merope’s son by birth— an allegation they staunchly denied. But the seeds of doubt burrowed
into Oedipus’ mind. He left to seek counsel
from Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, who instead delivered
a deeply disturbing prophecy: Oedipus would murder his father
and have children with his mother. Horrified, Oedipus determined
to stay far from Corinth and the only parents he’d ever known. He ventured towards Thebes—
and thus, unwittingly, towards the city where his
birth parents reigned. At a crossroads on the way, a fancy carriage threatened to run
Oedipus off the road, and a lethal fight ensued. Little did Oedipus know, one of the
casualties was King Laius of Thebes, his own birth father. In killing him, Oedipus had fulfilled
the first half of Apollo’s prophecy. When Oedipus reached the gates of Thebes,
he was met by the treacherous Sphinx. She’d ravaged the city, posing a bewildering riddle
to those she encountered and mercilessly devouring
all who answered incorrectly. But when she fixed her keen,
expectant gaze on Oedipus, he gave the correct response. Thebes celebrated the Sphinx's defeat, and Oedipus married the city's recently
widowed queen, Jocasta. They had four children, neither realizing
they were, in fact, mother and son— or that they’d completed the second half
of Apollo’s prophecy. Eventually, a devastating plague
descended on Thebes. To save the city, Oedipus sent his
brother-in-law to consult Apollo’s oracle. She declared that the divine plague
would only relent if the killer of Thebes’
previous king, Laius, was finally revealed,
then driven out or avenged with blood. Oedipus hastily opened an investigation. He interrogated Tiresias, a blind prophet, who stayed silent before suggesting
that Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus denied and deflected
the accusation. But it stuck with him. Jocasta likewise insisted that Laius’
killer couldn’t have been Oedipus, for she'd heard that Laius was killed
at a crossroads by robbers. Yet, through conversations with a
messenger from Corinth and, finally, the shepherd who’d rescued him
as an infant, the truth came bearing down upon Oedipus. In searching for Laius’ murderer,
he’d been looking for himself, and Apollo’s prophecy had come to pass,

**Transcript**:
Though Oedipus would dodge death,
vanquish the monstrous Sphinx, and whether wrathful plagues, the truth would prove
his greatest challenger. When Oedipus’ mother,
Queen Jocasta of Thebes, gave birth to him,
a grim heir seized the occasion. Her husband, King Laius, had received
a prophecy from Apollo’s oracle foretelling that he would die
at the hands of his own son. Determined to escape this fate,
Laius had the newborn’s ankles pierced, and Jocasta ordered a shepherd to abandon
him on Mount Cithaeron to perish. But divine prophecies
can be quite stubborn. The shepherd took pity on the baby
and gave him to to another shepherd— this one from Corinth. He decided to bring the baby to the
childless Corinthian king and queen, Polybus and Merope. They called the boy Oedipus,
or “swollen-foot,” and raised him as their own,
never revealing his true origin. Years passed, till one night, a drunken reveler told Oedipus that he was
not Polybus and Merope’s son by birth— an allegation they staunchly denied. But the seeds of doubt burrowed
into Oedipus’ mind. He left to seek counsel
from Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, who instead delivered
a deeply disturbing prophecy: Oedipus would murder his father
and have children with his mother. Horrified, Oedipus determined
to stay far from Corinth and the only parents he’d ever known. He ventured towards Thebes—
and thus, unwittingly, towards the city where his
birth parents reigned. At a crossroads on the way, a fancy carriage threatened to run
Oedipus off the road, and a lethal fight ensued. Little did Oedipus know, one of the
casualties was King Laius of Thebes, his own birth father. In killing him, Oedipus had fulfilled
the first half of Apollo’s prophecy. When Oedipus reached the gates of Thebes,
he was met by the treacherous Sphinx. She’d ravaged the city, posing a bewildering riddle
to those she encountered and mercilessly devouring
all who answered incorrectly. But when she fixed her keen,
expectant gaze on Oedipus, he gave the correct response. Thebes celebrated the Sphinx's defeat, and Oedipus married the city's recently
widowed queen, Jocasta. They had four children, neither realizing
they were, in fact, mother and son— or that they’d completed the second half
of Apollo’s prophecy. Eventually, a devastating plague
descended on Thebes. To save the city, Oedipus sent his
brother-in-law to consult Apollo’s oracle. She declared that the divine plague
would only relent if the killer of Thebes’
previous king, Laius, was finally revealed,
then driven out or avenged with blood. Oedipus hastily opened an investigation. He interrogated Tiresias, a blind prophet, who stayed silent before suggesting
that Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus denied and deflected
the accusation. But it stuck with him. Jocasta likewise insisted that Laius’
killer couldn’t have been Oedipus, for she'd heard that Laius was killed
at a crossroads by robbers. Yet, through conversations with a
messenger from Corinth and, finally, the shepherd who’d rescued him
as an infant, the truth came bearing down upon Oedipus. In searching for Laius’ murderer,
he’d been looking for himself, and Apollo’s prophecy had come to pass,
in all its dreadful detail. Full of fury, resentment, and shame,
Oedipus rushed to kill Jocasta— but she too had realized the truth
and taken her own life. Using brooches from her dress,
Oedipus blinded himself in anguish, expunging his deceitful sense of sight, which had kept him

**Transcript**:
You’ve spent months creating
a basketball-playing robot, the Dunk-O-Matic, and you’re excited to demonstrate it
at the prestigious Sportecha Conference. Until you read an advertisement: “See the Dunk-O-Matic face human players
and automatically adjust its skill to create a fair game for every opponent!” That's not what you were told to create. You designed a robot that shoots baskets, sometimes successfully and sometimes not,
taking turns with a human opponent. No one said anything about teaching it
to adjust its performance. Maybe the CEO skimmed an article
about AI and overpromised, setting you up for public embarrassment. Luckily, you installed a feature
where given any probability q, you can adjust the robot to have that
probability of success on each attempt. You swiftly gather information,
and jackpot: your team has a dossier on all
potential demo participants, including the probability each has
of making baskets. In each match, the human shoots first,
then the robot, then the human again, and so on until someone makes
the first successful basket and wins. You can remotely adjust the Dunk-O-Matic’s
probability between opponents. What should that probability
be for each opponent, so that the human has a 50% chance
of winning each match? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You might guess that q
should be equal to p. But that ignores the advantage
of going first. Suppose p and q are both 100%. Even though the competitors
are equally skilled, the first player always wins. So a deeper analysis is required. One approach involves adding up every
chance the human has to win, using geometric series. A geometric series is an infinite
sum of numbers, where each number is the previous number
multiplied by a common ratio. Two facts about geometric series
are useful here. First, if the common ratio r
of a geometric series has absolute value less than 1, the series has a finite total. And second, if the first number
in the series is a, that total is: a divided by 1-minus-r. How does this help us calibrate our robot? Remember that the human has probability p
of making a basket. Since they go first, they have probability
p of winning on the first try. What’s the probability that they win
on the second try? That attempt only happens
if both players miss. The probability of a miss is 1 minus
the probability of a success, so the miss probabilities are
1-minus-p and 1-minus-q. The chance of both happening
is the product of those values. So the probability of two failures
and then a human success is p times (1-minus-p) times (1-minus-q). Winning on the third try requires
another round of misses, so that chance is p multiplied
by the double-miss probability twice. If we add all the possible probabilities
of a human win, the total is the sum
of a geometric series. Since the first number in the series is p, and the ratio is this product
that’s less than 1, the sum will be
(p divided by 1) minus the ratio. We want this sum to be 1/2. Using some algebra to solve for q, we find that q should equal p
divided by 1-minus-p. If p is greater than 50%,
q would need to be bigger than 1, which can’t happen. In that case, a fair game is impossible, because the human has a better-than-50%
chance of winning immediately. The robot's total probability is also
the total of a geometric series. How does this series compare
to the human’s? To win, the robot needs some number
of double misses, then a human failure
followed by a robot success. If q equals p over 1-minus-p, (1-minus-p) times q is p. For our choice of q, not only do these
series have the same sum, but they’re the same series! We could bypass geometric series
by starting with this reasoning. The robot’s chances of winning in the
first round is (1-minus-p) times q, and so if we want that chance to match
the human’s first-round chance, we want it to equal p,
making q: p over 1-minus-p. More rounds may occur,
but before each round, the competitors are tied,
so everything effectively restarts. If they have the same odds of winning
in the first round, they also will in the second round,
and so on. The demonstration goes perfectly, but while you didn't want
to embarrass yourself, you also didn’t want
to deceive the public. Taking the stage, you explain
your company’s false promises and your hastily ad-libbed solution. Thankfully, the ensuing bad press
is directed at your employers, and it turns out the
presentation volunteers own a more employee-friendly
robotics company. After some tedious intellectual
property litigation, you find yourself at a healthier workplace with a regular spot on a
pickup basketball team.

**Transcript**:
The world is always abuzz with sounds, many of which human ears
simply can't hear. However, other species
have extraordinary adaptations that grant them access
to realms of sonic extremes. And some of them don’t even have ears—
at least, not like we typically imagine. To understand how the animal kingdom’s
best listeners do it, we need to know the rules of their game. When an object in a medium
like air or water moves, it sends out physical waves. The basics of hearing involve structures
that vibrate in response to these waves and excite sensory cells, generating signals that nerves transmit
to the brain, where they’re processed. But despite the assemblage
of sound-absorbing and -amplifying structures in our ears, many noises are too quiet
for us to detect. Owls, however, have some workarounds. Our external ears funnel sounds inward— but many owls use their whole faces
to do this. Their ears,
hidden beneath a flap of feathers, have eardrums proportionally much larger
and more sensitive than humans’. And because many owls ears
are positioned asymmetrically, sound waves reach them at different times. This slight delay helps their brains
determine the direction of the sound’s source. And great grey owl wings have
especially thick velvety coatings and long feather combs and fringes, which are thought to help reduce
their flight sounds. So, while hovering,
they can go undetected and concentrate on the subtle sounds
of their prey. All these adaptations enable
a great grey owl to hear a vole tunneling under 18 inches of snow— and make a fatal strike. Other animals are almost all ears, like the aptly named long-eared jerboa, which is the animal kingdom’s largest ears
in proportion to body length. These sizable sound-collectors help
the jerboas sense low frequency noises— and keep cool by radiating heat. Fennec foxes use
their large, swiveling ears to rapidly home in on activity
beneath Sahara sands, while bat-eared foxes can
pick up savanna sounds as slight as termites crawling
and munching on grasses. Ogre-faced spiders, meanwhile, might not have ears in the traditional
vertebrate sense, but their legs are covered by receptors
sensitive to sound waves as soft as those generated
by mosquito flight. This allows them to catch airborne prey— even after being blindfolded
by scientists. Lots of different features also help
animal ears hit especially high notes, like the extra hard, stiff middle ear
bones of toothed whales; like dolphins and sperm whales, which efficiently propagate
high-frequency vibrations. Indeed, some toothed whales and bats
emit sound pulses around 200,000 hertz and listen for the reflections. These high-frequency wavelengths— more than 10 times higher
than what we can hear— are small enough to generate
strong reflections from objects as tiny as the insects
many bats are after, which would be missed altogether
by lower ones. But many insects are also
in on the conversation— and vigilant to ultrasonic onslaughts. The greater wax moth can register
the highest frequencies of any animal recorded—
up to 300,000 hertz, thanks to thin, vibration-sensitive,
eardrum-like membranes on their abdomens. In fact, hearing organs have
evolved independently more than 20 times among insects. Katydids sense ultrasonic sounds
with their front legs; certain hawkmoths can hear
with their mouthparts; a parasitic fly registers cricket chirps
from organs behind its head; and the praying mantis has just one
hearing organ, which sits smack in the midline
of its thorax. But how low can animals go? Well, baleen whales emit sounds
around 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals. These vibrations can travel
thousands of kilometers. And they get picked up by other
baleen whales— possibly via their skulls, which conduct the vibrations
along to their ear bones. Snakes pick up ground vibrations
by way of their jawbones, which connect directly
to their middle ear bones. And Namib Desert golden moles regularly
stick their heads into the sand, which likely helps them use their large,
club-like middle ear bones to sense low frequency activity
in mounds more than 20 meters away. So, odds are: if a tree falls in a forest,
someone’s bound to hear it.

**Transcript**:
The world is always abuzz with sounds, many of which human ears
simply can't hear. However, other species
have extraordinary adaptations that grant them access
to realms of sonic extremes. And some of them don’t even have ears—
at least, not like we typically imagine. To understand how the animal kingdom’s
best listeners do it, we need to know the rules of their game. When an object in a medium
like air or water moves, it sends out physical waves. The basics of hearing involve structures
that vibrate in response to these waves and excite sensory cells, generating signals that nerves transmit
to the brain, where they’re processed. But despite the assemblage
of sound-absorbing and -amplifying structures in our ears, many noises are too quiet
for us to detect. Owls, however, have some workarounds. Our external ears funnel sounds inward— but many owls use their whole faces
to do this. Their ears,
hidden beneath a flap of feathers, have eardrums proportionally much larger
and more sensitive than humans’. And because many owls ears
are positioned asymmetrically, sound waves reach them at different times. This slight delay helps their brains
determine the direction of the sound’s source. And great grey owl wings have
especially thick velvety coatings and long feather combs and fringes, which are thought to help reduce
their flight sounds. So, while hovering,
they can go undetected and concentrate on the subtle sounds
of their prey. All these adaptations enable
a great grey owl to hear a vole tunneling under 18 inches of snow— and make a fatal strike. Other animals are almost all ears, like the aptly named long-eared jerboa, which is the animal kingdom’s largest ears
in proportion to body length. These sizable sound-collectors help
the jerboas sense low frequency noises— and keep cool by radiating heat. Fennec foxes use
their large, swiveling ears to rapidly home in on activity
beneath Sahara sands, while bat-eared foxes can
pick up savanna sounds as slight as termites crawling
and munching on grasses. Ogre-faced spiders, meanwhile, might not have ears in the traditional
vertebrate sense, but their legs are covered by receptors
sensitive to sound waves as soft as those generated
by mosquito flight. This allows them to catch airborne prey— even after being blindfolded
by scientists. Lots of different features also help
animal ears hit especially high notes, like the extra hard, stiff middle ear
bones of toothed whales; like dolphins and sperm whales, which efficiently propagate
high-frequency vibrations. Indeed, some toothed whales and bats
emit sound pulses around 200,000 hertz and listen for the reflections. These high-frequency wavelengths— more than 10 times higher
than what we can hear— are small enough to generate
strong reflections from objects as tiny as the insects
many bats are after, which would be missed altogether
by lower ones. But many insects are also
in on the conversation— and vigilant to ultrasonic onslaughts. The greater wax moth can register
the highest frequencies of any animal recorded—
up to 300,000 hertz, thanks to thin, vibration-sensitive,
eardrum-like membranes on their abdomens. In fact, hearing organs have
evolved independently more than 20 times among insects. Katydids sense ultrasonic sounds
with their front legs; certain hawkmoths can hear
with their mouthparts; a parasitic fly registers cricket chirps
from organs behind its head; and the praying mantis has just one
hearing organ, which sits smack in the midline
of its thorax. But how low can animals go? Well, baleen whales emit sounds
around 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals. These vibrations can travel
thousands of kilometers. And they get picked up by other
baleen whales— possibly via their skulls, which conduct the vibrations
along to their ear bones. Snakes pick up ground vibrations
by way of their jawbones, which connect directly
to their middle ear bones. And Namib Desert golden moles regularly
stick their heads into the sand, which likely helps them use their large,
club-like middle ear bones to sense low frequency activity
in mounds more than 20 meters away. So, odds are: if a tree falls in a forest,
someone’s bound to hear it.

you do not understand!” Suddenly, the books caught fire. The man looked back at the astounded Rumi
and simply replied: “You couldn’t possibly understand.” The mysterious figure was Shams of Tabriz, a charismatic Sufi mystic who would
transform Rumi's worldview. Rumi, inspired by Shams’ teachings, would go on to become one of the world’s
most celebrated poets and mystical philosophers, whose cultural legacy looms large across
Türkiye and the Persian-speaking world. Rumi was born in 1207
near the Afghan city of Balkh, and as a child emigrated to Anatolia,
where his father— a preacher and mystic— hoped to secure a more
prestigious position. By the time of Shams’ arrival, Rumi was a well-respected scholar
of Islamic law in the town of Konya. While he had been exposed to Sufism— the mystical path within Islam,
which focuses on experiencing God’s love— he’d shown little interest in it. But this changed in his late thirties,
when Shams came into his life. The academic study of law and theology
was no longer Rumi's central focus. Rather, he saw them as candles guiding
the way towards his ultimate goal: the reunification of his soul with God
through the experience of divine love. He wrote of this tension
in his native Persian, “Love resides not in learning,
not in knowledge, not in pages and books. Wherever the debates of men may lead,
that is not the lover’s path.” While Sufism had been part
of Islamic observance for centuries, the practices of some Sufis—
from ecstatic dancing to composing poetry— were looked down upon by conservative
religious elites. As Rumi increasingly embraced Sufism
under Shams’ influence, many of his earlier followers disapproved. When Shams suddenly disappeared,
suspicions arose that he'd been murdered. Rumi expressed his devastation
through poetry: “He bathed us like a candle in his light;
in thin air vanished, left us!” Rather than turning away from Sufism,
Rumi became more devoted, participating in ritualized dancing
and preaching the religion of love through lectures, poetry, and prose. And while Shams would never return,
Rumi continued to share his teachings, seeing himself as the moon
reflecting the light of Shams’ sun. While in his mystical states,
he composed the “Divan-i-Shams,” a sprawling collection of lyrical poems that included many of the sayings
for which he is famous today. The work expresses intense feelings
of love and longing, not only for his vanished mentor,
but for the divine creator. Over time, Rumi's poetry matured. He no longer saw himself
as a reflection of Shams, but as a beacon of light on his own. In his early fifties,
Rumi wrote “Masnavi,” which shifts from ecstatic expressions
of divine love to verses that guide others
to discover it for themselves. The poems are complex and layered, incorporating ideas, stories, and quotes
from Islamic religious texts, Arabic and Persian literature,
and earlier Sufi writings and poetry. In one story, he invokes the well-known
characters of Layla and the love-crazed Majnun. In Rumi’s version, the king, hearing Majnun’s musings
on Layla’s unsurpassed beauty, demands to see her. But when Layla arrives, he’s confused, as her beauty pales in comparison
to Majnun's praises. To this, Layla replies, “I am Layla.
The problem is you are not Majnun.” For Rumi, experiencing love meant opening
his heart to all of God’s creation— looking at everything and everyone
like Majnun gazing upon Layla. In this way, he saw romantic love
as an expression— on a smaller scale— of divine love. Following Rumi’s death, the Mevlevi Sufi
order was established around his teachings and still exists in Türkiye today. His poems and other writings were copied
and dispersed across the Islamic world, inspiring and shaping Persian poetry, before being introduced to the West
in the 19th century. For generations, his works have been
read and reread, translated and reinterpreted,
drawing admirers from around the world. While Rumi's words reflect his specific
historical context and Islamic worldview, for many, his message feels universal: “If you have lost heart
in the Path of Love, flee to me without delay: I am a fortress invincible.”

he composed the “Divan-i-Shams,” a sprawling collection of lyrical poems that included many of the sayings
for which he is famous today. The work expresses intense feelings
of love and longing, not only for his vanished mentor,
but for the divine creator. Over time, Rumi's poetry matured. He no longer saw himself
as a reflection of Shams, but as a beacon of light on his own. In his early fifties,
Rumi wrote “Masnavi,” which shifts from ecstatic expressions
of divine love to verses that guide others
to discover it for themselves. The poems are complex and layered, incorporating ideas, stories, and quotes
from Islamic religious texts, Arabic and Persian literature,
and earlier Sufi writings and poetry. In one story, he invokes the well-known
characters of Layla and the love-crazed Majnun. In Rumi’s version, the king, hearing Majnun’s musings
on Layla’s unsurpassed beauty, demands to see her. But when Layla arrives, he’s confused, as her beauty pales in comparison
to Majnun's praises. To this, Layla replies, “I am Layla.
The problem is you are not Majnun.” For Rumi, experiencing love meant opening
his heart to all of God’s creation— looking at everything and everyone
like Majnun gazing upon Layla. In this way, he saw romantic love
as an expression— on a smaller scale— of divine love. Following Rumi’s death, the Mevlevi Sufi
order was established around his teachings and still exists in Türkiye today. His poems and other writings were copied
and dispersed across the Islamic world, inspiring and shaping Persian poetry, before being introduced to the West
in the 19th century. For generations, his works have been
read and reread, translated and reinterpreted,
drawing admirers from around the world. While Rumi's words reflect his specific
historical context and Islamic worldview, for many, his message feels universal: “If you have lost heart
in the Path of Love, flee to me without delay: I am a fortress invincible.”
