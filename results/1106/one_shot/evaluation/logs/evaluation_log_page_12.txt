**Transcript**:
There are more than one and a half billion
people out there using the internet every day, and just like you, they're looking for
answers. We here at SciShow are looking for answers
too, answers to questions about science and nature and the human body, Earth and the universe! So we're working with Google and YouTube to
answer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of
hiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that
they swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing
a teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups
-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your
diaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your
lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What is the most common approach to getting rid of hiccups?**
Options: A. Stimulating the vagus nerve, B. Increasing carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream, C. Holding your breath for 10 seconds, D. Drinking a glass of water quickly

Although the question phrasing is not identical, the intent and content of this generated MCQ align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks "How do we stop hiccups?" and the correct option is "We have to hit the reset button on our nervous system and get our diaphragm to relax." The generated MCQ (Question 6) asks about the most common approach to getting rid of hiccups, and option B (Increasing carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream) is related to the concept of hitting the reset button on the nervous system, as discussed in the transcript.

However, an even more similar generated MCQ can be found in the options, but it is not a perfect match:

**Question 4: What is one way to get rid of hiccups by stimulating the vagus nerve?** is not a perfect match, but **Question 2** and other questions are not matches.

A match is found in the options of **Question 6**, but a more direct match would be a question like: "How do we get rid of hiccups?" with the options being "Hit the reset button on the nervous system", among others.

Since the original question was "How do we stop hiccups?" and its answer was "We have to hit the reset button on our nervous system and get our diaphragm to relax", the best match is **Question 6**, which is the closest in terms of the solution (hitting the reset button) being the increase of CO2 in the blood.

However, another generated question is even more similar to the original question:

**Question 2** is not similar, but another question could have been generated to have the same intent as the original question.

Upon re-reading the generated questions, I noticed that I missed a key point in my analysis. I should have looked for a generated question that has an intent similar to "How do we stop hiccups?" and its corresponding answer.

Unfortunately, I did not find a question with the exact same intent as the original question. However, I did find that **Question 6** has a similar solution to the original question.

But then I realized that I missed a crucial point in the analysis. I should have checked each generated question against the original question.

Upon re-checking the questions, I found that I made an error in my analysis.

Since I did not find a question that matches the original question's intent, I should have said that there is no matching question.

However, I must choose the best match from the given options.

In that case, I will choose **Question 6**, as it is the closest match.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **6**

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What is one way to get rid of hiccups by stimulating the vagus nerve?

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, as both questions are asking about a method for getting rid of hiccups. The correct option for Question 4, "A. Swallowing a teaspoon of sugar", is also similar to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, which explains that swallowing sugar confuses the vagus nerve and makes it start concentrating on the throat, leaving the diaphragm alone.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Hey there, engineer buddies! I just want to thank you so much
for helping out in the last episode. I needed to get my phone out of the storm
drain, and together, we designed a solution. Our robot was just one of many possible solutions, and maybe you had an even better idea at home. If you did, please send it my way.
I'd love to check it out! But I've got a whole new challenge for you. Have you ever just wanted
some space to yourself? A place to relax, do your own thing,
eat Nutella straight off your fingers, and burp with abandon? Yeah, I need that.
That is a thing I need. You know what can help? I bet you already guessed it! Engineering. So how do we use the engineering
process to solve this problem? [Music] Well, first, we've got to define the problem. I need a place that is secluded and quiet. I need it to provide privacy
and a sense of my-ownness. Sounds pretty great, right? What about a big box to use as my space? It's secluded and it can be all my own. Solution-wise, it's a start, but a small one. We need to consider more options. What if I made adjustments to a
space I already have: my room? I could hang blankets from the ceiling
to help block out sounds from outside, and then I could also sing my
head off to T Swift if I wanted to without bothering the rest of my family. To top things off, I could add
a "Do Not Enter" sign to my door. Like, a serious sign. 
Bold font, all caps. Respect my sign! Okay, we've got two options. What else? What if instead of adjusting a space
I already have, I create a new space? There's a word for what we're
talking about here: architecture. Maybe we could become not just engineers,
but architects: engineers who design buildings. Even though the title of the job is a little
different, the process is still the same. So before doing architecture, we've got to weigh our options and choose
the best design to take into trials. Let's think about the box idea first. It's probably too small. I'd either be squished or
be half hanging out of it. Okay, how about tricking out my room? Again, while I'd feel like I have a sense
of privacy, I'd know that at any point, any one of my family members could bust in, and the blankets on the walls 
would muffle some of the sound, but wouldn't totally block them out. But hey, here's an idea:
what about a tree house? It would be totally my own, it would be far enough from my house that any weird burps or loud renditions
of "Shake It Off" wouldn't bug my family. Of course, it would take some
work. Some architecture work. So architect, activate!  [Music] Let's build the treehouse! It'll have a drop-down rope ladder that
I can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot
when someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from
my second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging
and reading and dancing around, but before we start building,
you know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,
we need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of
this particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose
and the weight of the treehouse are really important variables
because we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes
to soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the
blankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise
I plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in
mind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support
little old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,
the load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,
maybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition
of "You Belong With Me," but they might fail when I belt out
"Shake It Off" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables
until we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,
the engineering process, when planning buildings from
skyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think
will be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots
of different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come
up with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success
criteria and navigate the variables? Let us know! [Music]

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What is the term used to describe the design of buildings? Options: A. Engineering, B. Architecture, C. Construction, D. Designing.

However, the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that asks "What is an architect?" with options that describe different types of engineers.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of content and intent. 

In this case, I would choose Question 9: How do architects use the engineering process? Options: A. They only use it for designing buildings, B. They use it for planning buildings from skyscrapers to small family homes, C. They only use it for designing treehouses, D. They don't use it at all.

However, this question is still not a perfect match.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that asks "What is an architect?" with options that describe different types of engineers.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's still not a perfect match.

Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of
Islam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he
was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed
learning about Black History and Malcolm X a civil rights activist and preacher. I hope you had fun learning with F.R.E.S.B.E.R.G

Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of
Islam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he
was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

Question 5 asks about the Pythagorean Theorem's use in the game, and one of its options (B) mentions finding the distance between two points on the chessboard. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks what the numbers do, and the correct answer is that they specify the distance Moldevort must move.

Although Question 5 is not a direct match, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Therefore, I would identify the index of the most similar generated MCQ as 5.

However, please note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ, and Question 5 is only a close approximation. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the purpose of the numbers in the game.

If you would like, I can try to suggest a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about how MoldeVort can get free, and the correct option is related to making a legal move without going off the board or off the center of a square.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8: Which spaces on the chessboard are bad for the player? Options: A. The corners., B. The neighboring spaces., C. The midpoints of the sides., D. The inside spaces.

Although this question does not directly ask about how MoldeVort can get free, it does relate to the concept of certain spaces on the board being "bad" for the player, which could potentially lead to MoldeVort getting free.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that directly addresses the question of how MoldeVort can get free.

Index: 8 (Note: This is not a perfect match, but rather a suggestion of a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.)

**Transcript**:
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

**Transcript**:
Nipah. Hendra. Ebola. Marburg. SARS. These
are some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely
fatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has
a lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have
surfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’
fault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther
into bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread
of commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via
pigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native
forests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing
diseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable
exceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge
numbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also
between species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t
die — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time
to spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense
amount of energy needed for flight without also producing a lot of reactive waste products
that damage our DNA. So when our bat cousins took to the air, they leveled-up their in-flight
DNA damage repair kits and other defenses, including specialized cells that keep viral
invaders in check. So bats can survive the deadly viruses - but
what may matter even more, for humans anyway, is how the viruses survive the bats. Nasty as they are, most viruses are also extremely
finicky — in order to thrive, they require the perfectly controlled climate inside a
normal, resting, on-the-ground mammal. But when bats take to the air, their internal
temperatures cruise to around 40°C. Those frequent in-flight saunas are far too toasty
for your average virus, but a few hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat.  Which,
incidentally, means they can definitely weather a meager human fever. Essentially, flight
may have helped bats gain virtual immunity to viruses AND trained viruses to be virtually
immune to us. Stupid flying. So, what should we land-lubbers do? We need
bats for insect control and pollination - and a whole bunch of other things - maybe we could
even learn some immune tricks from them - like how to be really good at not getting cancer!
Plus, bats aren’t the biggest carriers of human disease. Humans are - just do the math.
Perhaps we’d be better off leaving bats alone, and trying to control the spread of
diseases carried by a different kind of flying mammal.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: Why do bats appear to carry more human-killing diseases than other animals? is not the best match, however, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. 

However, a closer match can be found in Question 3's Option C: "Bats often roost together in large numbers, allowing viruses to spread easily"  that indirectly relates to why "Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola" are extremely fatal as stated in the ground truth MCQ.

But the best match is actually Question 5, in the sense that the ground truth MCQ mentions that "Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely fatal" which could be related to how some hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat inside bats (Option C of Question 5), but it is still a weak match.

However, if we were to choose the best match it would be Question 5.

**Transcript**:
Nipah. Hendra. Ebola. Marburg. SARS. These
are some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely
fatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has
a lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have
surfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’
fault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther
into bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread
of commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via
pigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native
forests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing
diseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable
exceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge
numbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also
between species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t
die — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time
to spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the options in Question 7 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. Both questions highlight the importance of bats in the ecosystem. Question 7 mentions that bats "provide insect control and pollination services," which aligns with options A and B in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question with options that more closely match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8 is not the best match, but it does have an option that mentions a benefit related to cancer, and option C in the ground truth MCQ does mention that bats can purify or has some relation to health, but it is not mentioned.

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the first thing the caterpillar eats, but none of the generated MCQs address this topic.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall topic of the caterpillar and its eating habits, I would choose:

Question 3: What happens to the caterpillar when he eats the right things? 

or 

Question 4: What happens to the caterpillar when he eats the wrong things?

But these questions do not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options.

If I really had to choose one, I would say that none of the questions match, but the closest would be:

 Question 2: What is the main topic of the story being read?

This question is about the story, and the story is about the caterpillar, but it does not address what the caterpillar eats.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and the best answer would be "None" or "Not Available".

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 does not have options that match the ground truth MCQ, I will also consider Question 5, which has an option that aligns with the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

But the most similar generated MCQ is actually not present among the options. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is the closest.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What happens to the caterpillar when he eats the right things? Options: A. He gets a stomachache, B. He grows into a beautiful butterfly, C. He becomes very tired, D. He loses his appetite.

However, the question content is not an exact match. A more similar question would be one that asks about the caterpillar's state at the end of the story. Since this is not available, we can consider Question 3, as it implies the caterpillar's transformation at the end.

But a closer look reveals that Question 3 is focused on the effect of eating the right things, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the caterpillar's state at the end of the story.

Given the provided options, the closest match would be Question 3, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not have the exact same question as the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks why the old lady swallowed a bird, and Question 3 asks what the old lady swallowed to catch the spider (the correct answer being a bird). However, the correct answer is not available among the options in Question 3.

It's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 3 is the closest match.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the outcome of the old lady swallowing a horse? Options: A. She becomes very full, B. She starts to cry, C. She dies, D. She starts to laugh.

However, the question content does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But among the given options, Question 5 has the closest relation to the ground truth MCQ.

If we consider the options provided in the ground truth MCQ, a more suitable match can be found by identifying the generated MCQ that contains the option "A horse" and is related to the old lady swallowing something.

In that case, a match is not found. However, we can consider Question 4, which mentions the horse as one of the items the old lady swallows, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Given the provided options, the closest match is not a direct match but Question 5.

However, if we were to recreate a question from the provided generated MCQs that would match the ground truth MCQ, it would be something like Question 4 but with different content.

But among the given options, I would choose Question 5 as the closest match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options provided. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the closest match can be inferred.

The ground truth MCQ asks if food contains energy, with options True or False. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 9 discusses the role of plants in capturing energy from the Sun and changing it into chemical energy. This implies that the energy is stored in the plants, which are a type of food.

However, a more direct connection can be made with the transcript, which states, "we use the energy that's in our food to stay alive." This is closely related to the ground truth MCQ. Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the most relevant, as it discusses what happens to the energy from a plant when an animal eats it. This implies that the energy is present in the plant (food) and is transferred to the animal's body.

Therefore, while not a perfect match, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, with the understanding that it implies the presence of energy in food.

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair
much shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got
a piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts
have in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind
of weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other
part of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as
you hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies
that it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,
toenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all
over the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they
carry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is
to help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,
taste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how
this works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on
the nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin
has nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,
or kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different
things. Some of them feel whether something is warm
or cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth
or rough. And there are also some that are in charge
of sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves
in my finger get switched on, and each one sends a message. Those messages travel through my hands … up
my arm … through a big bundle of nerves that’s in my back … and all the way to
my brain! Then, my brain decodes the messages. It checks if I’ve ever touched anything
like this before, and combines that with any other information it can get, like if I can
see the thing I’m feeling. This all happens really fast, which is how
I can figure out what I’m touching right away — Squeaks’ nose! [Squeaks sneezes] Oh, I’m sorry ! I guess your nose is kinda
ticklish, Squeaks! So, our sense of touch takes more than just
our hands. It also takes our nerves, and our brains,
too! But what about our hair? Well, try this. Pat the top of your head. Just like the skin that’s on your fingers,
the skin that’s under your hair has nerves. So your fingers can feel the top of your head,
and your head can feel your fingers touching it! Just like how Squeaks felt my finger with
his nose. Now find the very end of a piece of hair and
try squeezing it, without pulling on it at all. Your fingers can feel your hair, but your
hair can’t feel your fingers! That’s because there are no nerves inside
your hair. And as long as you’re not pulling on your
hair, or moving it around too much, you’re not going to feel a thing. The same goes for the very ends of your fingernails
and toenails. They don’t have nerves in them either. No nerves means no sense of touch, so they
don’t feel anything. And if there’s no sense of touch, there’s
no pain. So the next time you get a haircut, now you’ll
know why it doesn’t hurt! [Squeaks squeaks] Yikes, you’re right Squeaks — I should
go if I don’t want to be late for my haircut! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun
with Squeaks and me, hit the subscribe button, and we’ll see you next time here at the
Fort! [♪ Outro ♪ ]

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When the brain receives a message from the nerves, it decodes the message. What does this mean?
Options: A. The brain receives the message, checks to see if it is a good message or a bad message, decides what steps to take, and then sends the action step back., B. The brain receives the message, checks to see if it feels like the correct message, decides which steps to take next, and then combines it with other messages it is receiving., C. The brain receives the message, checks to see if they have ever sensed something like the message they are receiving before, and combines that with any other information it can get. (If I touch something ,can I also see it), D. The brain receives the message, checks to see if they truly sense it or if it is a false positive, combines that decision with other information and returns a message.

[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair
much shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got
a piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts
have in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind
of weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other
part of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as
you hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies
that it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,
toenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all
over the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they
carry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is
to help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,
taste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how
this works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on
the nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin
has nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,
or kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different
things. Some of them feel whether something is warm
or cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth
or rough. And there are also some that are in charge
of sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves
in my finger get switched on, and each one sends a message. Those messages travel through my hands … up
my arm … through a big bundle of nerves that’s in my back … and all the way to
my brain! Then, my brain decodes the messages. It checks if I’ve ever touched anything
like this before, and combines that with any other information it can get, like if I can
see the thing I’m feeling. This all happens really fast, which is how
I can figure out what I’m touching right away — Squeaks’ nose! [Squeaks sneezes] Oh, I’m sorry ! I guess your nose is kinda
ticklish, Squeaks! So, our sense of touch takes more than just
our hands. It also takes our nerves, and our brains,
too! But what about our hair? Well, try this. Pat the top of your head. Just like the skin that’s on your fingers,
the skin that’s under your hair has nerves. So your fingers can feel the top of your head,
and your head can feel your fingers touching it! Just like how Squeaks felt my finger with
his nose. Now find the very end of a piece of hair and
try squeezing it, without pulling on it at all. Your fingers can feel your hair, but your
hair can’t feel your fingers! That’s because there are no nerves inside
your hair. And as long as you’re not pulling on your
hair, or moving it around too much, you’re not going to feel a thing. The same goes for the very ends of your fingernails
and toenails. They don’t have nerves in them either. No nerves means no sense of touch, so they
don’t feel anything. And if there’s no sense of touch, there’s
no pain. So the next time you get a haircut, now you’ll
know why it doesn’t hurt! [Squeaks squeaks] Yikes, you’re right Squeaks — I should

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun
with Squeaks and me, hit the subscribe button, and we’ll see you next time here at the
Fort! ♪Outro♪

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, its content and options are the most similar. Question 5 asks what happens to the nerves when they don't get enough blood, and one of the options (C) states that they stop working and the area becomes numb. The ground truth MCQ asks when the nerves stop sending the sharp, poking feeling and the correct answer is when they receive enough blood from the blood vessels. 

However, if I had to choose an answer that best aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ from the generated options, I would say that Question 6 is also a close match. Question 6 asks why nerves get confused when they start getting blood again after being numb, and one possible answer choice (which is not provided) could be that they stop sending the sharp, poking feeling when they adjust to the new blood flow.

But among the provided options, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What was one of the activities that Teacher Cat did with the kittens in class? Options: A. Building a fountain that spouts fish, B. Playing a game of hide-and-seek, C. Reading a book about cats, D. Singing a song about dogs**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about an activity that Teacher Cat did with the kittens, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about something Cat does NOT teach the kittens.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about an activity or subject that Teacher Cat did not teach or cover in class. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match this intent.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 10: What did Teacher Cat learn from his experience teaching kiddie school? Options: A. That kittens are too much work, B. That teaching is boring, C. That he can learn to appreciate kittens, D. That he should stick to napping**

However, this question still does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is closest in terms of content and intent:

**Index: 3**

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about a subject or activity that Teacher Cat did not teach or cover in class.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: When should you use "es" instead of "s" to form a plural? Options: A. After a vowel sound, B. After a consonant sound, C. After a hissing sound, D. After a silent sound.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about a specific word ("glass") but rather about the general rule for using "es" to form plurals.

A more similar question would be one that asks about forming the plural of a specific word that ends with a hissing sound, such as "glass". Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, Question 5: What are some examples of words that use "es" to form a plural? Options: A. Cats, dogs, and birds, B. Glasses, dishes, and bunches, C. Cars, trucks, and buses, D. Pencils, pens, and papers is the closest match in terms of content, as it lists "glasses" as an example of a word that uses "es" to form a plural.

Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 5.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After evaluating the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that Question 4 is the closest match.

Question 4: Which of the following is an example of a compound word? Options: A. Although, B. Until, C. Eliminate, D. All three options are correct.

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the correct way to write a compound word when putting together "all" + "though." Although the generated MCQ does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it does deal with the concept of compound words and provides "although" as one of the options.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 (index 4) is the most similar generated MCQ. However, please note that it is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that explicitly asks about the correct way to write a compound word when combining "all" and "though."

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: Which of the following is an example of a compound word? Options: A. Although, B. Until, C. Eliminate, D. All three options are correct.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Deals with compound words, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.
2. Includes "until" as one of the options, which is the specific compound word mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.
3. Requires the test-taker to identify a correct example of a compound word, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ's task of writing a compound word correctly.

However, it's worth noting that Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options. A more ideal match would be a question that asks about the correct spelling of a compound word, specifically "until".

Since there isn't a more similar question, I will provide the index of Question 4.

Index: 4

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What is an example of a human resource? 

However, the options provided in Question 4 do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks for an example of something that is NOT a human resource.

A more suitable match would be Question 3: What are human resources? But it also doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but with a caveat that it's not an exact match.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific character's actions in the story, while the generated MCQs are mostly about the narrator, the theme, or the format of Brightly Storytime.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, as it mentions the theme of the book being read in Brightly Storytime, which is related to the story's content. But it's still not a good match, as the question intent and options are quite different.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about Peter taking something home in his pocket, but none of the generated MCQs mention Peter or anything related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the snow theme, I would say Question 3: What event is the narrator looking forward to? Options: A. A sunny day, B. A rainy day, C. A snowstorm, D. A holiday. This question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ, but it's the closest in terms of theme.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is about Peter's feelings when his snowball has melted, but none of the generated MCQs mention Peter or his snowball.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the context of the transcript, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match. It's about the narrator's excitement about the snowstorm, which is related to the theme of the book being read in Brightly Storytime. But it's still not a good match, as the question content and options are quite different.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

 Question 4 (Index: 4)

But please note that this is a very weak match, and the generated MCQs do not adequately cover the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: What event is the narrator looking forward to? Options: A. A sunny day, B. A rainy day, C. A snowstorm, D. A holiday.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about the reason for Peter's excitement. But among the given options, it is the closest match.

But upon closer inspection, I found that Question 4: Why is the narrator excited about the snowstorm? Options: A. So she can stay inside and read, B. So she can go outside and play, C. So she can go to school, D. So she can go to work is a better match in terms of intent.

The correct match would be a question that asks about Peter's excitement, but since there is no direct mention of Peter in the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What happened to the bear while he was asleep? 

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the change in sounds the bear hears while traveling, and the correct answer mentions the buzzing of bees becoming the rumbling of car traffic. Question 3 asks about what happened to the bear while he was asleep and mentions the bear being swept away, which is related to the change in sounds described in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the change in sounds the bear hears. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what returned the bear to his forest, with options including a truck, car, boat, and train. The correct answer is a boat, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the generated MCQs.

However, Question 8: "What did the bear see from the top of the tree?" is the closest match, as it mentions the bear seeing his forest from the top of the tree, which implies that the bear is on his way back to his forest. Although this question does not directly ask about what returned the bear to his forest, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

The narrator of Brightly Storytime, B. The author and illustrator of the book, C. A character in the book "My Friend Maggie", D. None of the above.

This question is the most similar because it is asking about Maggie, who is a character in the story, and is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ. However, please note that the question intent and options are still quite different.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific event in the story (Paula's treatment of Maggie after she starts playing with Veronica), while the generated MCQs are more focused on general information about the story, the narrator, and the theme.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 4: "What is the theme of the story 'My Friend Maggie'?" is the closest match. This question is related to the theme of friendship, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ. However, the options and content of the two questions are still quite different.

There are more than one and a half billion
people out there using the internet every day, and just like you, they're looking for
answers. We here at SciShow are looking for answers
too, answers to questions about science and nature and the human body, Earth and the universe! So we're working with Google and YouTube to
answer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of
hiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that
they swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing
a teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups
-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your
diaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your
lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but
of all the questions in the world, what do YOU most want answered? Let us know on Facebook or Twitter or in the

answer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of
hiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that
they swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing
a teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups
-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your
diaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your
lungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm
of the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air
really quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp
shut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly
as it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which
means it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset
button on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's
a nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some
of your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve
-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups
by swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it
sounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules
can provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on
your throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the
hiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural
breathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous
system will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting
techniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper
bag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen
and ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head
in the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't
be so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of
you who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred
method for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%. We're loving answering these questions, but

[Music] Hey there, engineer buddies! I just want to thank you so much
for helping out in the last episode. I needed to get my phone out of the storm
drain, and together, we designed a solution. Our robot was just one of many possible solutions, and maybe you had an even better idea at home. If you did, please send it my way.
I'd love to check it out! But I've got a whole new challenge for you. Have you ever just wanted
some space to yourself? A place to relax, do your own thing,
eat Nutella straight off your fingers, and burp with abandon? Yeah, I need that.
That is a thing I need. You know what can help? I bet you already guessed it! Engineering. So how do we use the engineering
process to solve this problem? [Music] Well, first, we've got to define the problem. I need a place that is secluded and quiet. I need it to provide privacy
and a sense of my-ownness. Sounds pretty great, right? What about a big box to use as my space? It's secluded and it can be all my own. Solution-wise, it's a start, but a small one. We need to consider more options. What if I made adjustments to a
space I already have: my room? I could hang blankets from the ceiling
to help block out sounds from outside, and then I could also sing my
head off to T Swift if I wanted to without bothering the rest of my family. To top things off, I could add
a "Do Not Enter" sign to my door. Like, a serious sign. 
Bold font, all caps. Respect my sign! Okay, we've got two options. What else? What if instead of adjusting a space
I already have, I create a new space? There's a word for what we're
talking about here: architecture. Maybe we could become not just engineers,
but architects: engineers who design buildings. Even though the title of the job is a little
different, the process is still the same. So before doing architecture, we've got to weigh our options and choose
the best design to take into trials. Let's think about the box idea first. It's probably too small. I'd either be squished or
be half hanging out of it. Okay, how about tricking out my room? Again, while I'd feel like I have a sense
of privacy, I'd know that at any point, any one of my family members could bust in, and the blankets on the walls 
would muffle some of the sound, but wouldn't totally block them out. But hey, here's an idea:
what about a tree house? It would be totally my own, it would be far enough from my house that any weird burps or loud renditions
of "Shake It Off" wouldn't bug my family. Of course, it would take some
work. Some architecture work. So architect, activate!  [Music] Let's build the treehouse! It'll have a drop-down rope ladder that
I can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot
when someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from
my second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging
and reading and dancing around, but before we start building,
you know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,
we need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of
this particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose
and the weight of the treehouse are really important variables
because we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes
to soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the
blankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise
I plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in
mind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support
little old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,
the load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,
maybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition
of "You Belong With Me," but they might fail when I belt out
"Shake It Off" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables
until we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,
the engineering process, when planning buildings from
skyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think
will be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots
of different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come
up with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success
criteria and navigate the variables? Let us know! [Music]

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In the video, we see that one failure point is if she builds a treehouse, she may be able to stay in but can't have friends over. What is a failure point?
Options: A. A place where a solution to a problem fails., B. A place where a solution to a problem has limits., C. A place where a solution to a problem causes a collapse in the solution., D. A place where a solution to the problem causes another unknown variable.
Correct Option: B

**Transcript**:
Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of

Hey, today we are going to have fun with learning
about Black History and a man named Malcolm X. With Black History in the United States, many
African-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights
Activist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about
his life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,
1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born
to Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was
often picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from
Omaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's
mother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were
placed in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into
trouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself
in prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he
discovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining
the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where
he would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American
Civil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,
Malcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and "You don't have to
have a peaceful revolution," when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of
Islam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he
was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

**Transcript**:
The evil wizard MoldeVort 
has been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like 
he’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, 
and if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms 
ward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation 
you throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner 
of the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose 
four distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, 
and if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly 
that distance away, the curse will force him 
to move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose 
any of the four numbers, and the process repeats until 
you can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell 
and almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose 
to keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? 
And what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort 
where you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game 
as MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively 
small board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 
to see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers
in just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one
of the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow
a number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end 
of a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are 
distance 5 from each other, which we know thanks 
to the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares 
of the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous 
Pythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over 
your chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,
you could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: 
If MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter 
to you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners 
as being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring 
the corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides 
are a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces 
on the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces 
are bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number 
larger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, 
since any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space 
or off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need 
to keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort 
to orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, 
1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make 
him go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, 
this is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him 
on the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here 
right away, you’ll be able to keep 
the world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why do scientists even need to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing?

**Transcript**:
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus. PCR then targets 
these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses. The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive 
for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus, showing if someone has previously 
been infected. They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection, but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood 
from an individual. This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further
boosting accuracy. And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic. These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them and the health professionals 
who administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.

**Transcript**:
Nipah. Hendra. Ebola. Marburg. SARS. These
are some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely
fatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has
a lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have
surfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’
fault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther
into bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread
of commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via
pigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native
forests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing
diseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable
exceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge
numbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also
between species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t
die — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time
to spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense
amount of energy needed for flight without also producing a lot of reactive waste products
that damage our DNA. So when our bat cousins took to the air, they leveled-up their in-flight
DNA damage repair kits and other defenses, including specialized cells that keep viral
invaders in check. So bats can survive the deadly viruses - but
what may matter even more, for humans anyway, is how the viruses survive the bats. Nasty as they are, most viruses are also extremely
finicky — in order to thrive, they require the perfectly controlled climate inside a
normal, resting, on-the-ground mammal. But when bats take to the air, their internal

for your average virus, but a few hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat.  Which,
incidentally, means they can definitely weather a meager human fever. Essentially, flight
may have helped bats gain virtual immunity to viruses AND trained viruses to be virtually
immune to us. Stupid flying. So, what should we land-lubbers do? We need
bats for insect control and pollination - and a whole bunch of other things - maybe we could
even learn some immune tricks from them - like how to be really good at not getting cancer!
Plus, bats aren’t the biggest carriers of human disease. Humans are - just do the math.
Perhaps we’d be better off leaving bats alone, and trying to control the spread of
diseases carried by a different kind of flying mammal.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Nipah. Hendra. Ebola. Marburg. SARS. These
are some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely
fatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has
a lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have
surfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’
fault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther
into bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread
of commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via
pigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native
forests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing
diseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable
exceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge
numbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also
between species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t
die — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time
to spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense
amount of energy needed for flight without also producing a lot of reactive waste products
that damage our DNA. So when our bat cousins took to the air, they leveled-up their in-flight
DNA damage repair kits and other defenses, including specialized cells that keep viral
invaders in check. So bats can survive the deadly viruses - but
what may matter even more, for humans anyway, is how the viruses survive the bats. Nasty as they are, most viruses are also extremely
finicky — in order to thrive, they require the perfectly controlled climate inside a
normal, resting, on-the-ground mammal. But when bats take to the air, their internal
temperatures cruise to around 40°C. Those frequent in-flight saunas are far too toasty
for your average virus, but a few hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat.  Which,
incidentally, means they can definitely weather a meager human fever. Essentially, flight

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

**Transcript**:
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each: it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out, enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it. These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful. But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.

[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: True or False? Food contains energy?
Options: A. True, B. False
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the role of plants in a food chain?
Options: A. To capture energy from the Sun and change it into chemical energy, B. To eat animals and transfer energy, C. To release energy into the air, D. To store energy in the soil
Correct Option: None

**Transcript**:
[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. 
I mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, 
pizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in 
our food to stay alive. But how did that energy get
 into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy 
flows between living things. It's almost like each form of food 
is a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional 
video game monster and maybe the odd bear, 
nothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows 
how energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, 
which scientists call a "habitat." And they all have a job to do, 
interacting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things 
that all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the 
non-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system 
called an "ecosystem!" And food chains show us 
what eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things 
are in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, 
they're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing 
for dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how 
these interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's 
in a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of 
lush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy 
from the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, 
wanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is 
transferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the 
rabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit 
is transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large 
or brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain 
as animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain. See you next time!

[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair
much shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got
a piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts
have in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind
of weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other
part of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as
you hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies
that it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,
toenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all
over the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they
carry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is
to help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,
taste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how
this works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on
the nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin
has nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,
or kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different
things. Some of them feel whether something is warm
or cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth
or rough. And there are also some that are in charge
of sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves
in my finger get switched on, and each one sends a message. Those messages travel through my hands … up
my arm … through a big bundle of nerves that’s in my back … and all the way to
my brain! Then, my brain decodes the messages. It checks if I’ve ever touched anything
like this before, and combines that with any other information it can get, like if I can
see the thing I’m feeling. This all happens really fast, which is how
I can figure out what I’m touching right away — Squeaks’ nose! [Squeaks sneezes] Oh, I’m sorry ! I guess your nose is kinda
ticklish, Squeaks! So, our sense of touch takes more than just
our hands. It also takes our nerves, and our brains,
too! But what about our hair? Well, try this. Pat the top of your head. Just like the skin that’s on your fingers,
the skin that’s under your hair has nerves. So your fingers can feel the top of your head,
and your head can feel your fingers touching it! Just like how Squeaks felt my finger with
his nose. Now find the very end of a piece of hair and
try squeezing it, without pulling on it at all. Your fingers can feel your hair, but your
hair can’t feel your fingers! That’s because there are no nerves inside
your hair. And as long as you’re not pulling on your
hair, or moving it around too much, you’re not going to feel a thing. The same goes for the very ends of your fingernails
and toenails. They don’t have nerves in them either. No nerves means no sense of touch, so they
don’t feel anything. And if there’s no sense of touch, there’s
no pain. So the next time you get a haircut, now you’ll
know why it doesn’t hurt! [Squeaks squeaks] Yikes, you’re right Squeaks — I should
go if I don’t want to be late for my haircut! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something
that presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on
your elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your
body. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting
or leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re
getting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and
needles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to
me! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,
even though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,
we don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t
feel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling
you get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your
body is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood
moving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels
by your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves
through all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work
properly. But when you sit in one position or lean on
your arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes
smaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg
can start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you
touch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something
that’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your
brain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re
getting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing
on his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much
— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his
leg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they
wake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/
you’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re
feeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling
comes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having
enough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and
needles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do
is just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the
meantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away
after a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting
back to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,
I’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun
