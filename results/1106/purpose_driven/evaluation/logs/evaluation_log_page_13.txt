**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health 
and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of opioid binding on other neurotransmitters, specifically dopamine and noradrenaline. Question 3 explains why opioid drugs are highly addictive, mentioning their binding to opioid receptors in the brain, releasing dopamine, and suppressing noradrenaline. This provides a similar context to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the effect of opioid binding on dopamine and noradrenaline, with options that reflect the correct relationships between opioid binding and these neurotransmitters.

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health 
and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 9: What is the purpose of opioid maintenance programs?**

Options: A. To provide short-term detoxification from opioids., B. To offer long-term medication-assisted therapy to eliminate opioid abuse., C. To provide counseling and behavioral therapy only., D. To prescribe opioid painkillers for chronic pain management.

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about how opioid maintenance programs attempt to bring people back to a drug-free lifestyle, while Question 9 asks about the purpose of opioid maintenance programs. Both questions are related to the goal of opioid maintenance programs, which is to eliminate opioid abuse and help individuals overcome addiction.

The correct option in Question 9 (B. To offer long-term medication-assisted therapy to eliminate opioid abuse) is similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (E. All of these are part of an opioid maintenance program), as both options mention the use of medication-assisted therapy to address opioid addiction.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is **9**.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, a more relevant question that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ would be one that asks about the combination of letters that form a specific sound, similar to Questions 2, 4, and 6.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest match in terms of question intent, as it asks about identifying a word that contains a specific sound. However, the options do not match the format of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one of the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but I would like to note that it is not a perfect match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After evaluating the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What type of word is "doesn't" in the transcript? Options: A. Verb, B. Noun, C. Adjective, D. Contraction**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about the method of making a contraction. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the method of making a contraction, such as using an apostrophe.

A better match is **Question 2: Which of the following phrases is an example of a contraction in the transcript?** However, this question still does not directly ask about the method of making a contraction.

Since none of the questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the question that is most relevant to the topic of contractions.

**Question 5: If the speaker wanted to make the sentence "The cat does not like the ball" more informal, which of the following options would they use?** This question implies the use of a contraction to make the sentence more informal, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I found an even better match: **None of the above questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 3 is the closest in terms of intent.**

**Question 3: What is the difference between "where is" and "where's" in the transcript? Options: A. "Where is" is used for plural nouns, while "where's" is used for singular nouns., B. "Where is" is a full phrase, while "where's" is a contraction., C. "Where is" is used for formal writing, while "where's" is used for informal writing., D. "Where is" is used for questions, while "where's" is used for statements.**

This question is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it asks about the difference between a full phrase and a contraction, which is related to the method of making a contraction.

The correct answer is: **3**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be Question 10, as it directly asks about a single word that is a contraction in the transcript, and one of the options (B. I'm) aligns with the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the overall intent of the question, I would choose Question 7, as it asks about identifying a full phrase or contraction, but it's not an exact match.

But the best match is Question 10, so the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 10

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about identifying the correct contraction for the words "do not." The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks about the type of word "doesn't" is in the transcript. However, a more suitable match is Question 2, which asks about identifying an example of a contraction in the transcript, but it does not specifically target the contraction "do not."

A closer examination reveals that Question 5 is about making a sentence more informal by using a contraction, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not specifically ask about the contraction "do not."

Considering the options and the intent of the ground truth MCQ, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but since "do not" and "don't" are not explicitly mentioned in Question 4, a better match is not found. However, among the given options, Question 4 is not the best match, Question 2 and Question 5 are more suitable but since "do not" is mentioned in the Ground Truth MCQ, none of the Generated MCQ is the perfect match but Question 5 would be the closest match because it has "does not" and its contraction.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the contraction of "is not" or "does not". Since there isn't a perfect match, I will choose the closest one.

A closer match can be found in Question 4: What type of word is "doesn't" in the transcript? Options: A. Verb, B. Noun, C. Adjective, D. Contraction, and Question 2: Which of the following phrases is an example of a contraction in the transcript? Options: A. The cat does not, B. I am thinking, C. The cat doesn't, D. Let us review.

However, an even better match is Question 3, as it deals with contractions, but not exactly "is not". But Question 5 and the other options mentioned are not as good as Question 3.

But the best match is actually Question 2 and more specifically Question 4 and even more specifically Question 7 with its options, and most specifically Question 10 with its options.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the "-at word family" and asks which word is NOT a part of it, whereas the generated MCQs are related to literature and literary devices.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you really need an index, I can tell you that the generated MCQs are not similar to the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is slightly related to words or language (although not similar), I would say:

 Question 7: What is the term for the repetition of initial consonant sounds in words that are close together? 

Index: 7

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ is about how plants "smell". The most similar generated MCQ would be one that is related to plants or biology.

Based on the options, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ. Although it is not about how plants "smell", it is about the process by which water moves through a plant, which is related to plant biology.

However, please note that Question 6 is not a good match, and a new generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ would be needed.

the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match would be a question that includes the disruption of the hydrophobic effect and its consequences.

A more suitable match can be found in the content of Question 2, but the actual question and options would need to be adjusted to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, Question 6 and the subsequent questions provide more context about the hydrophobic effect, but none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 2, as it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the MILD technique for lucid dreaming, while the generated MCQs cover various topics in psychology.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I cannot provide an index. However, I can suggest that a new set of generated MCQs be created that focus on the topic of lucid dreaming and the MILD technique to increase the chances of finding a matching question.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the technique WILD, which stands for Wake Induced Lucid Dreams. None of the generated MCQs are about this topic. However, some generated MCQs are related to psychology and dreams, but not specifically about WILD.

If I had to choose the least dissimilar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 7, which is about sleep deprivation and cognitive function. Although it's not directly related to WILD, it's the closest topic among the generated MCQs.

Index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ: 7

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of WILD.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the "SH" sound in "Fish" and "wish", while Question 7 asks about the significance of "sheep ship", which is also related to phonetic similarity.

However, it's worth noting that the options and the correct answer of Question 7 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 7**

But please keep in mind that the match is not perfect, and the generated MCQs do not exactly replicate the ground truth MCQ.

**Question 8: What is the tone of the transcript? Options: A. Serious and educational, B. Playful and rhythmic, C. Scary and intense, D. Sad and melancholic**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent of Question 8 is related to the emotional tone or feeling conveyed in the transcript, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ ("When we first meet the shark, how does it feel?"). The correct option in the ground truth MCQ is "Happy", which aligns with the playful and rhythmic tone suggested in Question 8.

However, a more direct match can be found in the options of **Question 5: What is the relationship between the shark and the fish in the transcript?** and other questions but none of them exactly match the content of the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose the closest match it would be **Question 8**.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the shark's feeling changing in the video. Although there isn't a direct match, Question 8: What is the tone of the transcript? could be considered the most similar. The tone of the transcript could be related to the emotions or feelings expressed in the video. However, it's essential to note that this is not a direct match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 8 is the closest match, but with a significant caveat that it's not a direct match.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a problem the prince has with one of the princesses based on the illustrations in the story, while the generated MCQs are asking about various aspects of the story itself.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 2: "What was the prince searching for in his travels around the world?" is the closest match. This question is related to the prince's search for a princess, which is the context for the ground truth MCQ. However, the options and content of this question are still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2, but with the caveat that it's still not a very close match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of a sentence, and the correct option is "B. words that convey a message." Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most similar, as it asks about a common characteristic of sentences. Although the options are not identical, option C in Question 6 mentions that sentences "always start with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark," which is related to the concept of a sentence.

However, it's worth noting that Question 6 does not directly ask about the definition of a sentence, and its options do not include a direct match for the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 6, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Can you guess what you’re looking at? Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: What is the estimated percentage of animal biomass that sea cucumbers comprise on the deep sea floor? Options: A. 10%, B. 50%, C. 95%, D. 100%**

Although this question does not directly ask about the location of sea cucumbers, it does provide information about their presence on the deep sea floor, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. However, a more relevant question is needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be:

**Generated MCQ (not present in the list): What type of environments can sea cucumbers be found in? Options: A. Only tropical waters, B. Various environments, from shallow shores to deep-sea trenches, C. Only deep-sea trenches, D. Only the Arctic Ocean**

Since this question is not present in the list, I will choose the closest match based on the information provided about sea cucumbers' habitats.

**Question 8** is not the best match, but it is the closest one. However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say **8**, but with the caveat that it's not an ideal match. A more suitable generated MCQ should be created to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 3 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions focus on the unique feature of the mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) in sea cucumbers. The correct option for the ground truth MCQ (A. Collagen fibrils slide together to stiffen the tissue and apart to soften it) is similar to the description of MCT in the transcript, which is also reflected in the correct option for Question 3 (B. It is a gel-like tissue that can change its stiffness). 

However, it's worth noting that the options for Question 3 do not exactly match the options for the ground truth MCQ. If the options for Question 3 were rewritten to match the options for the ground truth MCQ, the similarity between the two questions would be even stronger.

**Transcript**:
Our perception of the world around us is
strongly linked to our vision. But how do you know what you're seeing
is real? Can you really trust your eyes? Take for example these two grey
rectangular columns, both of which are different shades of
grey. Or are they? It turns out that they're the exact same. And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there your eyes refused to see them as the
same. Introducing colors produces the same result. I promise no trick photography or
editing effects have been applied. In fact, if you look up the Munker-White
illusion, you'll come across many more examples. Examine them in Photoshop and you can
see that the colors are the exact same. A similar effect can be seen with this
checkerboard illusion. Tile A clearly seems darker than tile B.
But you know better by now, right? Even though your eyes can't see it, you
know when I removed the surrounding imagery the tiles will be the same color. So
what's going on here? The truth is that scientists don't fully
understand this phenomenon, and there are many complex biological
and neurological factors taking place. Ultimately, our brains judge color and
brightness in context. In other words, our brains compare the
surrounding environment in order to create our perception. The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case, is not to provide us with an absolute
color or physical property of our external reality, but to interpret what we see as
efficiently as possible in order to interact with the
environment most appropriately. The tile illusion takes advantage of this
phenomenon. Our brains know that shadows make
objects look darker, as a result the brain compensates by
interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it
becomes obvious. Once again, the darkness of the background has
affected our perception of the bar's color. Our perception is relative. So do you still trust your eyes? Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and Twitter and subscribe for more weekly science
videos.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the question wording is different, the intent and content of Question 5 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks what shadows do to objects when viewed with our eyes, and the correct option is that they make them appear lighter in color (due to brain compensation). Question 5 asks why the brain compensates by interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears, and the correct answer would be related to shadows making objects look darker (which is the reason for the brain's compensation). 

However, note that the correct option in Question 5 is actually option B, which is "Because shadows make objects look darker," not option C as in the ground truth MCQ. Despite this difference, Question 5 is still the most similar to the ground truth MCQ among the provided options.

**Transcript**:
It's time for learning with fun facts about
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for kids. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American
Baptist minister, activist humanitarian, and also known for being the leader of the African-American
Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta,
Georgia on January 15th in 1929. Now the world knows him today as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr, but his name wasn't always Martin. He was actually born and given the name Michael,
by his father, but that all changed during a trip to Germany where the theologian Martin
Luther impressed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s father so much that he changed his name and
his son’s name too. Now when it came to education Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was very smart. That's right when he was a kid he literally
skipped two grades the 9th and the 11th to enter Morehouse College at the young age of
15 in 1944. Later on Dr. King entered Boston University. There he completed his school work in 1953
earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. Also while he was there he met his love Coretta
Scott. That's right Coretta Scott was a young singer
from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. They later got married in 1953. Not long thereafter he got involved in the
civil rights movement taking part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, after Rosa Parks had been arrested
by not going to the back of the bus after the bus driver told her she couldn’t sit
at the front. Of course many know Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr from taking part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, where his world famous,
“I have a dream,” speech set a fire to the civil rights movement there can still
be echoed today of people wanting freedom and wanting to be treated equally. From there his name only group and in 1964
dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. Sadly Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life was
cut short being assassinated on April 4 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the

One thing I like to do every week is read
my favorite comic books. Now on't get me wrong, I like to read books
too, but I love reading comic books and seeing what my favorite superheroes are up to. What about you? Do you like reading comic books? Maybe you like playing video games and you
have to read what is on the screen, to pass on to the next level. No, maybe you like going on the internet and
playing games, or talking to people. Well whether you know it or not you are reading. But what if you weren't allowed to read? I know that sounds like a silly question,
but what if it were against the law for you to read? Well in American history during slavery African
Americans were not allowed to read. It was against the law for slaves to read,
or even have someone teach them how to read. This is where the next person in African American
history I want to talk about stood up as a leader and an abolitionist. An abolitionist is someone who wanted slavery
to be stopped, and they spoke out against people who used African Americans as slaves. Right now that person I want to talk to you
about is one of the most famous African American abolitionists, by the name of Frederick Douglass. Known as the most recognized African American
leader before the civil war, Frederick Douglass was born a slave. He never knew his father, and was separated
from his mother earlier in life. This is where as a slave he moved from plantation
to plantation, until one slave owner’s wife helped him learn the basics of reading. Now like I said before at that time teaching
slaves to read was against the law, and when her husband found out he stopped her from
teaching Frederick. Although he didn't have a teacher Frederick
was still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and
learning how to read. He watched other white children who learned
in school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also
taught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,
because he did not want other slaves to learn reading like Frederick did. Frederick eventually stood up to the beatings,
and one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other
people who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these
people were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking
in front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick
impressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his
life. The biography told about everything he went
through in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but
this put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come
to the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made
enough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during
the civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had
respect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today
is Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama
and he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another
famous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice
to President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons
to African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick
spoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought
why didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t
do. It was not acceptable to just go out and live
a free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against
slavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always
be one of the greats in African American History. Frederick Douglass for Kids(Cartoon Biography)

was still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and
learning how to read. He watched other white children who learned
in school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also
taught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,
because he did not want other slaves to learn reading like Frederick did. Frederick eventually stood up to the beatings,
and one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other
people who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these
people were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking
in front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick
impressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his
life. The biography told about everything he went
through in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but
this put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come
to the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made
enough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during
the civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had
respect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today
is Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama
and he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another
famous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice
to President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons
to African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick
spoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought
why didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t
do. It was not acceptable to just go out and live
a free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against
slavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always
be one of the greats in African American History. Frederick Douglass for Kids(Cartoon Biography)

One thing I like to do every week is read
my favorite comic books. Now on't get me wrong, I like to read books
too, but I love reading comic books and seeing what my favorite superheroes are up to. What about you? Do you like reading comic books? Maybe you like playing video games and you
have to read what is on the screen, to pass on to the next level. No, maybe you like going on the internet and
playing games, or talking to people. Well whether you know it or not you are reading. But what if you weren't allowed to read? I know that sounds like a silly question,
but what if it were against the law for you to read? Well in American history during slavery African
Americans were not allowed to read. It was against the law for slaves to read,
or even have someone teach them how to read. This is where the next person in African American
history I want to talk about stood up as a leader and an abolitionist. An abolitionist is someone who wanted slavery
to be stopped, and they spoke out against people who used African Americans as slaves. Right now that person I want to talk to you
about is one of the most famous African American abolitionists, by the name of Frederick Douglass. Known as the most recognized African American
leader before the civil war, Frederick Douglass was born a slave. He never knew his father, and was separated
from his mother earlier in life. This is where as a slave he moved from plantation
to plantation, until one slave owner’s wife helped him learn the basics of reading. Now like I said before at that time teaching
slaves to read was against the law, and when her husband found out he stopped her from
teaching Frederick. Although he didn't have a teacher Frederick
was still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and
learning how to read. He watched other white children who learned
in school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also
taught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,

It's time for learning with a fun Rosa Parks
for kids cartoon. Hey history is full of courageous people who
stood up to help us get to where we are today. Right now I want to talk to you about one
of those people named Rosa Parks. Have you ever heard of Rosa Parks? If not that's okay because I am going to give
you a few fun facts about Rosa Parks for kids and her life as a civil rights activist. Starting off Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise
McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she
may be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would
not be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they
stayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa
to see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their
farm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans
and her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair
either. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students
were not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school
in the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who
was a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't
called African American. They were called, "Colored." She later got her high school degree and became
involved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do
something in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in
the United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the
local buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and
African Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then
leave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign
marked, "Coloreds." On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver
to move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said
Rosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had
her arrested. She was later convicted for not following
the laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked
the Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans
coming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when
many buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,
1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be
one that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward
trying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the
age of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten
and I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids.

It's time for learning with a fun Rosa Parks
for kids cartoon. Hey history is full of courageous people who
stood up to help us get to where we are today. Right now I want to talk to you about one
of those people named Rosa Parks. Have you ever heard of Rosa Parks? If not that's okay because I am going to give
you a few fun facts about Rosa Parks for kids and her life as a civil rights activist. Starting off Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise
McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she
may be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would
not be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they
stayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa
to see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their
farm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans
and her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair
either. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students
were not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school
in the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who
was a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't
called African American. They were called, "Colored." She later got her high school degree and became
involved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do
something in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in
the United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the
local buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and
African Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then
leave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign
marked, "Coloreds." On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver
to move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said
Rosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had
her arrested. She was later convicted for not following
the laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked
the Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans
coming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when
many buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,
1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be
one that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward
trying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the
age of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten
and I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about two-letter combinations that make the same sound, while the generated MCQs are all related to the transcript's content about cowboys and cows.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the presence of similar sounds or words, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but only because it contains the word "ou" in the option "The Thousand Cow Ranch". However, this is a very weak connection and not a true match.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose an index, it would be:

1 (with the caveat that it's not a true match)

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about a word that rhymes with "found" from the video. The closest generated MCQ that deals with sounds or words is Question 4, which asks about a sound heard while searching for a cow. However, this is still not a good match.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one based on relevance to sounds or words, I would say Question 4 is the closest, but still not a good match.

Index: 4 (Note: This is not a good match, but the closest based on relevance to sounds or words)

Although the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about sentence starters for "where" sentences, and Question 3 asks about the type of word used to start a sentence to describe where something is happening.

However, a more similar generated MCQ would be one that includes options similar to the ground truth MCQ, such as prepositions (on, beside, near, underneath). Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent of Question 8 is similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions address the rule to follow when using specific types of words to start a sentence (-ing, -ed, or -ly words). The correct option for the ground truth MCQ mentions including a comma when continuing the sentence, which aligns with option C in Question 8, "To separate the introductory phrase from the rest of the sentence." This indicates that the comma is used to separate the introductory phrase (which may be an -ing, -ed, or -ly word) from the rest of the sentence.

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health 
and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health 
and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000

**Transcript**:
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 6
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

**Transcript**:
Can you guess what you’re looking at? Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Our perception of the world around us is
strongly linked to our vision. But how do you know what you're seeing
is real? Can you really trust your eyes? Take for example these two grey
rectangular columns, both of which are different shades of
grey. Or are they? It turns out that they're the exact same. And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there your eyes refused to see them as the
same. Introducing colors produces the same result. I promise no trick photography or
editing effects have been applied. In fact, if you look up the Munker-White
illusion, you'll come across many more examples. Examine them in Photoshop and you can
see that the colors are the exact same. A similar effect can be seen with this
checkerboard illusion. Tile A clearly seems darker than tile B.
But you know better by now, right? Even though your eyes can't see it, you
know when I removed the surrounding imagery the tiles will be the same color. So
what's going on here? The truth is that scientists don't fully
understand this phenomenon, and there are many complex biological
and neurological factors taking place. Ultimately, our brains judge color and
brightness in context. In other words, our brains compare the
surrounding environment in order to create our perception. The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case, is not to provide us with an absolute
color or physical property of our external reality, but to interpret what we see as
efficiently as possible in order to interact with the
environment most appropriately. The tile illusion takes advantage of this
phenomenon. Our brains know that shadows make
objects look darker, as a result the brain compensates by
interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it
becomes obvious. Once again, the darkness of the background has
affected our perception of the bar's color. Our perception is relative. So do you still trust your eyes? Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and Twitter and subscribe for more weekly science
videos.

It's time for learning with fun facts about
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for kids. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American
Baptist minister, activist humanitarian, and also known for being the leader of the African-American
Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta,
Georgia on January 15th in 1929. Now the world knows him today as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr, but his name wasn't always Martin. He was actually born and given the name Michael,
by his father, but that all changed during a trip to Germany where the theologian Martin
Luther impressed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s father so much that he changed his name and
his son’s name too. Now when it came to education Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was very smart. That's right when he was a kid he literally
skipped two grades the 9th and the 11th to enter Morehouse College at the young age of
15 in 1944. Later on Dr. King entered Boston University. There he completed his school work in 1953
earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. Also while he was there he met his love Coretta
Scott. That's right Coretta Scott was a young singer
from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. They later got married in 1953. Not long thereafter he got involved in the
civil rights movement taking part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, after Rosa Parks had been arrested
by not going to the back of the bus after the bus driver told her she couldn’t sit
at the front. Of course many know Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr from taking part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, where his world famous,
“I have a dream,” speech set a fire to the civil rights movement there can still
be echoed today of people wanting freedom and wanting to be treated equally. From there his name only group and in 1964
dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. Sadly Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life was
cut short being assassinated on April 4 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the
balcony of the Lorraine Motel. Although the nation was sad the voice and
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would still ring loud today. The hard work that he did during the civil
rights movement would soon be listened to and that's when the Civil Rights Act of 1968
was passed by Congress and although many celebrated his birthday around the country in multiple
cities at the White House Rose Garden on November 2nd 1983 President Ronald Reagan signed a
bill creating a federal holiday to honor Dr. King's works and those were fun facts about
dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Baptist minister, activist humanitarian, and also known for being the leader of the African-American
Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta,
Georgia on January 15th in 1929. Now the world knows him today as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr, but his name wasn't always Martin. He was actually born and given the name Michael,
by his father, but that all changed during a trip to Germany where the theologian Martin
Luther impressed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s father so much that he changed his name and
his son’s name too. Now when it came to education Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was very smart. That's right when he was a kid he literally
skipped two grades the 9th and the 11th to enter Morehouse College at the young age of
15 in 1944. Later on Dr. King entered Boston University. There he completed his school work in 1953
earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. Also while he was there he met his love Coretta
Scott. That's right Coretta Scott was a young singer
from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. They later got married in 1953. Not long thereafter he got involved in the
civil rights movement taking part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, after Rosa Parks had been arrested
by not going to the back of the bus after the bus driver told her she couldn’t sit
at the front. Of course many know Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr from taking part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, where his world famous,
“I have a dream,” speech set a fire to the civil rights movement there can still
be echoed today of people wanting freedom and wanting to be treated equally. From there his name only group and in 1964
dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. Sadly Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life was
cut short being assassinated on April 4 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the
balcony of the Lorraine Motel. Although the nation was sad the voice and
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would still ring loud today. The hard work that he did during the civil
rights movement would soon be listened to and that's when the Civil Rights Act of 1968
was passed by Congress and although many celebrated his birthday around the country in multiple
cities at the White House Rose Garden on November 2nd 1983 President Ronald Reagan signed a
bill creating a federal holiday to honor Dr. King's works and those were fun facts about
dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

One thing I like to do every week is read
my favorite comic books. Now on't get me wrong, I like to read books
too, but I love reading comic books and seeing what my favorite superheroes are up to. What about you? Do you like reading comic books? Maybe you like playing video games and you
have to read what is on the screen, to pass on to the next level. No, maybe you like going on the internet and
playing games, or talking to people. Well whether you know it or not you are reading. But what if you weren't allowed to read? I know that sounds like a silly question,
but what if it were against the law for you to read? Well in American history during slavery African
Americans were not allowed to read. It was against the law for slaves to read,
or even have someone teach them how to read. This is where the next person in African American
history I want to talk about stood up as a leader and an abolitionist. An abolitionist is someone who wanted slavery
to be stopped, and they spoke out against people who used African Americans as slaves. Right now that person I want to talk to you
about is one of the most famous African American abolitionists, by the name of Frederick Douglass. Known as the most recognized African American
leader before the civil war, Frederick Douglass was born a slave. He never knew his father, and was separated
from his mother earlier in life. This is where as a slave he moved from plantation
to plantation, until one slave owner’s wife helped him learn the basics of reading. Now like I said before at that time teaching
slaves to read was against the law, and when her husband found out he stopped her from
teaching Frederick. Although he didn't have a teacher Frederick
was still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and
learning how to read. He watched other white children who learned
in school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also
taught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,
because he did not want other slaves to learn reading like Frederick did. Frederick eventually stood up to the beatings,
and one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other
people who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these
people were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking
in front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick
impressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his
life. The biography told about everything he went
through in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but
this put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come
to the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made
enough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during
the civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had
respect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today
is Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama
and he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another
famous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice
to President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons
to African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick
spoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought
why didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t
do. It was not acceptable to just go out and live
a free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against
slavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always
be one of the greats in African American History. Frederick Douglass for Kids(Cartoon Biography)

It's time for learning with a fun Rosa Parks
for kids cartoon. Hey history is full of courageous people who
stood up to help us get to where we are today. Right now I want to talk to you about one
of those people named Rosa Parks. Have you ever heard of Rosa Parks? If not that's okay because I am going to give
you a few fun facts about Rosa Parks for kids and her life as a civil rights activist. Starting off Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise
McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she
may be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would
not be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they
stayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa
to see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their
farm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans
and her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair
either. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students
were not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school
in the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who
was a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't
called African American. They were called, "Colored." She later got her high school degree and became
involved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do
something in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in
the United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the
local buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and
African Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then
leave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign
marked, "Coloreds." On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver
to move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said
Rosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had
her arrested. She was later convicted for not following
the laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked
the Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans
coming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when
many buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,
1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be
one that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward
trying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the
age of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten
and I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids.

It's time for learning with a fun Rosa Parks
for kids cartoon. Hey history is full of courageous people who
stood up to help us get to where we are today. Right now I want to talk to you about one
of those people named Rosa Parks. Have you ever heard of Rosa Parks? If not that's okay because I am going to give
you a few fun facts about Rosa Parks for kids and her life as a civil rights activist. Starting off Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise
McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she
may be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would
not be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they
stayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa
to see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their
farm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans
and her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair
either. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students
were not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school
in the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who
was a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't
called African American. They were called, "Colored." She later got her high school degree and became
involved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do
something in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in
the United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the
local buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and
African Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then
leave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign
marked, "Coloreds." On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver
to move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said
Rosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had
her arrested. She was later convicted for not following
the laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked
the Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans
coming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when
many buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,
1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be
one that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward
trying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the
age of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten
and I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids.
