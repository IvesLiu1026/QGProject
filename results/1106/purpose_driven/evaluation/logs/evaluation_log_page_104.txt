**Transcript**:
Long ago, La’amaomao, 
the Hawaiian wind goddess, wielded a gourd that housed
the winds of the Islands. It came to hold her bones, 
along with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed
to her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped 
around his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir 
the skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant
to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status
also made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators
were especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills
and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,
but they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors
and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped
of his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who
plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, 
where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
imagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,
the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised 
to avenge his father and restore his rightful place 
beside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed
their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been
deceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants
divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct
canoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not
return so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication
had to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived 
in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using 
for canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had 
his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, 
the king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit 
misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, 
Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,
but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed 
the young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, 
Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter
on Molokaʻi. For four months, 
Kuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,
he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a
agreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously
discredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge
and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
except the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, 
eventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, 
he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island 
instead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted
not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home 
and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish
against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed 
by the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him
ahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,
the fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a
wager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly
in their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled 
himself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen 
were to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a 
to have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a
to reveal his identity and have the King prove 
his commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths
and asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position
would be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a 
were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names
of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them 
never undermined or forgotten.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific event of Paka'a fleeing to an island.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content related to Paka'a or the islands, I would say Question 9 is the closest, but it's still not a match.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index.

To match the ground truth MCQ, a generated MCQ with the following content would be needed:

Question: On which island did Pākaʻa flee?
Options: A. Oʻahu, B. Molokaʻi, C. Kauaʻi, D. Maui

If you can generate more MCQs or modify the existing ones to better match the ground truth MCQ, I would be happy to help you evaluate them.

**Transcript**:
Long ago, La’amaomao, 
the Hawaiian wind goddess, wielded a gourd that housed
the winds of the Islands. It came to hold her bones, 
along with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed
to her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped 
around his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir 
the skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant
to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status
also made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators
were especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills
and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,
but they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors
and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped
of his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who
plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, 
where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
imagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,
the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised 
to avenge his father and restore his rightful place 
beside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed
their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been
deceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants
divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct
canoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not
return so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication
had to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived 
in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using 
for canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had 
his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, 
the king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit 
misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, 
Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,
but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed 
the young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, 
Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter
on Molokaʻi. For four months, 
Kuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,
he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a
agreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously
discredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge
and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
except the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, 
eventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, 
he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island 
instead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted
not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home 
and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish
against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed 
by the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him
ahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,
the fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a
wager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly
in their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled 
himself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen 
were to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a 
to have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a
to reveal his identity and have the King prove 
his commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths
and asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position
would be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a 
were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names
of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them 
never undermined or forgotten.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Paka'a's ancestral spirits revealing his location to the king in a dream, and the correct option is "Two birds." 

Generated MCQ 2 mentions that a gourd housed the winds of the Islands and was passed down to Paka'a, but it also mentions that Paka'a's ancestral spirits arrived in the form of two birds and rotted the trees the king was using for canoe-building.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQs.

where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
imagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,
the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised 
to avenge his father and restore his rightful place 
beside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed
their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been
deceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants
divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct
canoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not
return so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication
had to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived 
in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using 
for canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had 
his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, 
the king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit 
misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, 
Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,
but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed 
the young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, 
Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter
on Molokaʻi. For four months, 
Kuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,
he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a
agreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously
discredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge
and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
except the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, 
eventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, 
he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island 
instead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted
not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home 
and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish
against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed 
by the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him
ahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,
the fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a
wager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly
in their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled 
himself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen 
were to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a 
to have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a
to reveal his identity and have the King prove 
his commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths
and asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position
would be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a 
were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names
of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them 
never undermined or forgotten.

**Transcript**:
Long ago, La’amaomao, 
the Hawaiian wind goddess, wielded a gourd that housed
the winds of the Islands. It came to hold her bones, 
along with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed
to her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped 
around his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir 
the skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant
to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status
also made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators
were especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills
and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,
but they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors
and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped
of his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who
plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, 
where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
