**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What are the possible sums that Minion A could have, based on the analysis?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of number provided to Minion A, and the correct answer is "The sum of the positive integers." Question 5 asks about the possible sums that Minion A could have, which is related to the fact that Minion A was given the sum of the positive integers.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but it would be better to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a common sign of the condition (chimerism), and the correct answer is "Deafness" as the option that is NOT a common sign of the condition.

A generated MCQ that is somewhat related to this topic is:

Question 3: According to Greek mythology, what is a chimera? Options: A. A creature with two heads, B. An amalgam of three different animals, C. A mythical creature with superpowers, D. A god with multiple personalities

However, this question does not directly address the signs of chimerism.

A more relevant generated MCQ could be:

Question 1: What was the unexpected result of genetic testing on Karen Keegan's three adult sons? Options: A. Two of them were a perfect match for kidney donation., B. Two of them weren't actually her sons., C. All three of them had a rare genetic disorder., D. None of them were a match for kidney donation.

However, this question still does not directly address the signs of chimerism.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

None of the above questions. However, if I had to choose, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

But if you insist on an index, I would say:

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US 
were all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light
to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US 
were all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light
to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the molecule that absorbs light to drive photosynthesis. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is related to photosynthesis, but it doesn't specifically ask about the molecule. However, Question 6 mentions chlorophyll fluorescence, which is closely related to the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis.

Considering the options and content, I would suggest that Question 6 is the closest match, although it's not a direct match. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

Index: 6

However, please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the molecule absorbing light to drive photosynthesis, with options including chlorophyll.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is the process by which plants and other organisms use light to grow?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent, as it does not ask about what is consumed during photosynthesis.

A closer match is:

**Question 5: What happens to excess light that plants absorb but cannot consume?**

However, this question still does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would choose:

**Question 5: What happens to excess light that plants absorb but cannot consume?**

But I must note that this is not a direct match.

If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create one with the following intent:

**Question: What is/are consumed by plants during photosynthesis?**

With options:

A. Glucose
B. Chlorophyll
C. Carbon dioxide
D. Oxygen

This would be a direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

However, since I need to provide an index from the existing generated MCQs, I will provide the index of the closest match, which is:

**Index: 5**

Please note that this is not a direct match, and a new MCQ should be created to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US 
were all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light
to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US
