**Transcript**:
Just for a moment, focus on your breath. In slowly. Out slowly. In slowly. Out. The same pattern repeats within
every one of us and consider your pulse. The beat is built into the very
fabric of our being. Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm
and repetition. It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition, rhythm and repetition. On, and in, and on, and out. And we delight in those aspects everyday, in the rhythm of a song, the beat of the drum, the nod of your head, or in the repetition of soup cans, the rows of an orchard, the artistry of petals. Pattern can be pleasure. In language, rhythm and repetition
are often used as the building blocks for poetry. There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as, "So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see." And there's the repetition of language
at multiple levels: the repetition of letters, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee," of sounds, "breathe," "see," "thee," and of words. With so many uses, repetition
is one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools. It can lift or lull the listener, amplify or diminish the line, unify or diversify ideas. In fact, even rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition. Yet for all its varied uses, too much repetition can backfire. Imagine writing the same sentence
on the blackboard twenty times, again, and again, and again, and again, or imagine a young child clamoring
for her mother's attention, "Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom." Not exactly what we might call poetry. So what is poetic repetition,
and why does it work? Possibly most familiar is rhyme, the repetition of like sounds
in word endings. As with Shakespeare's example, we often encounter rhyme
at the ends of lines. Repetition in this way creates
an expectation. We begin to listen for the repetition
of those similar sounds. When we hear them, 
the found pattern is pleasurable. Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos, we hear the echo in the oral chatter. Yet, rhyme need not surface solely
at a line's end. Notice the strong "i" sound in, "So long lives this 
and this gives life to thee." This repetition of vowel sounds
is called assonance and can also be heard 
in Eminem's "Lose Yourself." Notice how the "e" and "o" sounds
repeat both within in and at the end of each line: "Oh, there goes gravity, Oh, there goes rabbit,
he choked, he so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's
to these ropes." The alternating assonance
creates its own rhythm, and invites us to try our own voices
in echoing it. Similarly, consonance is the repetition
of like consonant sounds, such as the "l" and "th" in, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee." In fact, this type of specific consonance, which occurs at the beginning of words may be familiar to you already. It's called alliteration,
or front rhyme. Great examples include tongue twisters. Betty bought some butter 
but the butter was bitter so Betty bought some better butter
to make the bitter butter better. Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent
as we trip over the consonance both within words and at their start. Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need
for variation in poetic repetition. While challenging to say, they're seen by some
as lesser imitations of poetry, or gimmicky because they hammer
so heavily on the same sounds, closer to that blackboard-style 
of repetition. Ultimately, this is the poet's 
balancing act, learning when to repeat and when to riff, when to satisfy expectations, and when to thwart them, and in that balance, 
it may be enough to remember we all live in a world of wild variation and carry with us our own breath and beat, our own repetition wherever we go.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about bodily functions that involve rhythm and repetition, with options including respiration and heart rate. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 1 asks about what is central to the human experience, according to the transcript. The transcript mentions that "we're creatures of rhythm and repetition" and cites the example of breath and pulse.

Although Question 1 does not directly ask about bodily functions, it is the closest generated MCQ that relates to the concept of rhythm and repetition in the human experience.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks for an example of repetition in language, and Question 2 also asks for an example of repetition in language. 

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 2 do not include the correct answer as specified in the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer in the ground truth MCQ is "Both A) Using the same letter to start words within a phrase and B) Words that sound similar", which is not present in Question 2.

If the options in Question 2 were revised to match the options in the ground truth MCQ, it would be an even closer match. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What is the term for the repetition of like consonant sounds, as mentioned in the transcript? Options: A. Assonance, B. Consonance, C. Alliteration, D. Rhyme**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the term for a repeated pattern of stressed syllables.

A closer match can be found in the transcript, where it is mentioned that "a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition" and also that "rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition." 

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this concept. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the options provided, I would choose:

**Question 1 is not a match, Question 2 is not a match, Question 3 is not a match, Question 4 is not a match, Question 5 is not a match, Question 6 is not a match, Question 7 is not a match, Question 8 is not a match, Question 9 is not a match, Question 10 is not a match**

However, I noticed that Question 6 has an option C (Rhythm is not present but it has an option that says "Alliteration" which is related to repetition and also has an option that says "Consonance" which is related to repetition, and the question 6 is about repetition), but the correct answer in the Question 6 is "Consonance" which is not the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ.

I can see that Question 3 has an option that says "It can backfire and become monotonous" this question has a relation with "repetition" which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

I can also see that Question 8 has an option that says "Learning when to repeat" this question has a relation with "repetition" which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

I can also see that Question 9 has an option that says "All of the above" and the question is about "repetition" which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

However the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ is "Rhythm". 

If I had to choose I would say that the Question that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ is the question that has the word "rhythm" or the question that is about the definition of "rhythm" in relation to the transcript.

Unfortunately I couldn't find a question that has the word "rhythm" as the correct answer or a question that is about the definition of "rhythm" in relation to the transcript.

If I really had to choose I would say:

**Question 6**

**Transcript**:
Just for a moment, focus on your breath. In slowly. Out slowly. In slowly. Out. The same pattern repeats within
every one of us and consider your pulse. The beat is built into the very
fabric of our being. Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm
and repetition. It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition, rhythm and repetition. On, and in, and on, and out. And we delight in those aspects everyday, in the rhythm of a song, the beat of the drum, the nod of your head, or in the repetition of soup cans, the rows of an orchard, the artistry of petals. Pattern can be pleasure. In language, rhythm and repetition
are often used as the building blocks for poetry. There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as, "So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see." And there's the repetition of language
at multiple levels: the repetition of letters, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee," of sounds, "breathe," "see," "thee," and of words. With so many uses, repetition
is one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools. It can lift or lull the listener, amplify or diminish the line, unify or diversify ideas. In fact, even rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition. Yet for all its varied uses, too much repetition can backfire. Imagine writing the same sentence
on the blackboard twenty times, again, and again, and again, and again, or imagine a young child clamoring
for her mother's attention, "Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom." Not exactly what we might call poetry. So what is poetic repetition,
and why does it work? Possibly most familiar is rhyme, the repetition of like sounds
in word endings. As with Shakespeare's example, we often encounter rhyme
at the ends of lines. Repetition in this way creates
an expectation. We begin to listen for the repetition
of those similar sounds. When we hear them, 
the found pattern is pleasurable. Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos, we hear the echo in the oral chatter. Yet, rhyme need not surface solely
at a line's end. Notice the strong "i" sound in, "So long lives this 
and this gives life to thee." This repetition of vowel sounds
is called assonance and can also be heard 
in Eminem's "Lose Yourself." Notice how the "e" and "o" sounds
repeat both within in and at the end of each line: "Oh, there goes gravity, Oh, there goes rabbit,
he choked, he so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's
to these ropes." The alternating assonance
creates its own rhythm, and invites us to try our own voices
in echoing it. Similarly, consonance is the repetition
of like consonant sounds, such as the "l" and "th" in, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee." In fact, this type of specific consonance, which occurs at the beginning of words may be familiar to you already. It's called alliteration,
or front rhyme. Great examples include tongue twisters. Betty bought some butter 
but the butter was bitter so Betty bought some better butter
to make the bitter butter better. Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent
as we trip over the consonance both within words and at their start. Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need
for variation in poetic repetition. While challenging to say, they're seen by some
as lesser imitations of poetry, or gimmicky because they hammer
so heavily on the same sounds, closer to that blackboard-style 
of repetition. Ultimately, this is the poet's 
balancing act, learning when to repeat and when to riff, when to satisfy expectations, and when to thwart them, and in that balance, 
it may be enough to remember we all live in a world of wild variation and carry with us our own breath and beat, our own repetition wherever we go.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is the term for the repetition of like sounds in word endings, as mentioned in the transcript? Options: A. Assonance, B. Consonance, C. Alliteration, D. Rhyme**

Although the question is phrased differently, the content and options are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of rhyme at the end of lines, while Question 4 asks about the term for the repetition of like sounds in word endings, which is actually "rhyme" (Option D). Additionally, the transcript mentions that rhyme creates an expectation for the listener of a pleasurable pattern, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ (Option C).

However, since the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of content and options.

**Transcript**:
As your country's top spy, you must infiltrate the headquarters
of the evil syndicate, find the secret control panel, and deactivate their death ray. But all you have to go on 
is the following information picked up by your surveillance team. The headquarters is a massive pyramid
with a single room at the top level, two rooms on the next, and so on. The control panel is hidden
behind a painting on the highest floor that can satisfy
the following conditions: Each room has exactly three doors
to other rooms on that floor, except the control panel room, which connects to only one, there are no hallways, and you can ignore stairs. Unfortunately, 
you don't have a floor plan, and you'll only have enough time
to search a single floor before the alarm system reactivates. Can you figure out which floor
the control room is on? Pause now to solve the riddle yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To solve this problem, 
we need to visualize it. For starters, we know 
that on the correct floor there's one room, let's call it room A, with one door to the control panel room, plus one door to room B, and one to C. So there must be at least four rooms, which we can represent as circles, drawing lines between them
for the doorways. But once we connect rooms B and C, there are no other connections possible, so the fourth floor down 
from the top is out. We know the control panel has to be
as high up as possible, so let's make our way down the pyramid. The fifth highest floor 
doesn't work either. We can figure that out by drawing it, but to be sure we haven't missed
any possibilities, here's another way. Every door corresponds to a line
in our graph that makes two rooms into neighbors. So in the end, there have to be
an even number of neighbors no matter how many connections we make. On the fifth highest floor,
to fulfill our starting conditions, we'd need four rooms 
with three neighbors each, plus the control panel room
with one neighbor, which makes 13 total neighbors. Since that's an odd number,
it's not possible, and, in fact, this also rules out every
floor that has an odd number of rooms. So let's go one more floor down. When we draw out the rooms, low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this. Incidentally, the study 
of such visual models that show the connections and
relationships between different objects is known as graph theory. In a basic graph, the circles representing
the objects are known as nodes, while the connecting lines 
are called edges. Researchers studying such graphs
ask questions like, "How far is this node from that one?" "How many edges does 
the most popular node have?" "Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?" Graphs like this are often used
to map communication networks, but they can represent almost
any kind of network, from transport connections within a city and social relationships among people, to chemical interactions between proteins or the spread of an epidemic
through different locations. So, armed with these techniques,
back to the pyramid. You avoid the guards and security cameras, infiltrate the sixth floor from the top, find the hidden panel, pull some conspicuous levers, and send the death ray crashing
into the ocean. Now, time to solve the mystery of why your surveillance team
always gives you cryptic information. Hi everybody. If you liked this riddle, 
try solving these two.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not ask about the possibility of a floor with 7 rooms, it does address the reason why a floor with an odd number of rooms (specifically the fifth highest floor) does not work as a possible location for the control panel. This is similar to the reasoning used in the ground truth MCQ to explain why a floor with 7 rooms would not be possible. 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. But among the available options, Question 5 is the most similar in terms of intent and underlying reasoning.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the possibility of a floor having eight rooms, given that six rooms is the smallest number for which it is possible. The closest generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks about the minimum number of rooms required on the floor where the control panel is located. However, this question does not address the possibility of a floor having eight rooms.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 3. However, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
As your country's top spy, you must infiltrate the headquarters
of the evil syndicate, find the secret control panel, and deactivate their death ray. But all you have to go on 
is the following information picked up by your surveillance team. The headquarters is a massive pyramid
with a single room at the top level, two rooms on the next, and so on. The control panel is hidden
behind a painting on the highest floor that can satisfy
the following conditions: Each room has exactly three doors
to other rooms on that floor, except the control panel room, which connects to only one, there are no hallways, and you can ignore stairs. Unfortunately, 
you don't have a floor plan, and you'll only have enough time
to search a single floor before the alarm system reactivates. Can you figure out which floor
the control room is on? Pause now to solve the riddle yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To solve this problem, 
we need to visualize it. For starters, we know 
that on the correct floor there's one room, let's call it room A, with one door to the control panel room, plus one door to room B, and one to C. So there must be at least four rooms, which we can represent as circles, drawing lines between them
for the doorways. But once we connect rooms B and C, there are no other connections possible, so the fourth floor down 
from the top is out. We know the control panel has to be
as high up as possible, so let's make our way down the pyramid. The fifth highest floor 
doesn't work either. We can figure that out by drawing it, but to be sure we haven't missed
any possibilities, here's another way. Every door corresponds to a line
in our graph that makes two rooms into neighbors. So in the end, there have to be
an even number of neighbors no matter how many connections we make. On the fifth highest floor,
to fulfill our starting conditions, we'd need four rooms 
with three neighbors each, plus the control panel room
with one neighbor, which makes 13 total neighbors. Since that's an odd number,
it's not possible, and, in fact, this also rules out every
floor that has an odd number of rooms. So let's go one more floor down. When we draw out the rooms, low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this. Incidentally, the study 
of such visual models that show the connections and
relationships between different objects is known as graph theory. In a basic graph, the circles representing
the objects are known as nodes, while the connecting lines 
are called edges. Researchers studying such graphs
ask questions like, "How far is this node from that one?" "How many edges does 
the most popular node have?" "Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?" Graphs like this are often used
to map communication networks, but they can represent almost
any kind of network, from transport connections within a city and social relationships among people, to chemical interactions between proteins or the spread of an epidemic
through different locations. So, armed with these techniques,
back to the pyramid. You avoid the guards and security cameras, infiltrate the sixth floor from the top, find the hidden panel, pull some conspicuous levers, and send the death ray crashing
into the ocean. Now, time to solve the mystery of why your surveillance team
always gives you cryptic information. Hi everybody. If you liked this riddle, 
try solving these two.

**Transcript**:
(electronic instrumental music) (tape rewinding) - [Sally] Ever been to Disneyland? That was definitely an E ticket. - [Voiceover] Shuttle Control Houston. That was Mission Specialist Sally Ride comparing her flight to Disneyland. - [Sally] I wish that there had been another woman on my flight. I wish that two of us
had gone up together. I think it would have been a lot easier. - [Gloria] It’s tough being the first, but you’ve done it with incredible grace. You also have the only job in the world that everybody understands. (laughing) - [Sally] My father, I
think, was so grateful when I became an astronaut because he did not understand astrophysicist. He couldn’t relate to that at all, but astronaut was something
he felt he understood. - [Gloria] But you could see
people all over the world connecting with what you were doing. - [Sally] Roughly half the people in the world would love to be astronauts, would give anything to
trade places with you, and the other half just can’t understand why in the world you would
do something that stupid. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] You don’t have 20-20 vision, can you become an astronaut candidate? I always thought that was
a big disabling factor. - [Sally] I think it used to be. Now as long as it’s correctable
to 20-20, it’s okay. So you’d probably qualify. (laughing) (upbeat instrumental music) I didn’t have any dreams about
being an astronaut at all and I don’t understand that because as soon as the opportunity was
open to me, I jumped at it. And I instantly realized that that was what I really wanted to do. I took all the science
classes that I could all the way through junior high
school and into high school. I went to a girls’
school that really didn’t have a strong science program
at all when I was there. At the time it was a
classic school for girls, with a good tennis team
and a good English teacher and essentially no math
past eleventh grade and no physics and no chemistry. - [Gloria] I’m curious about the reception that you got inside NASA. What kind of thing happened to you? - [Sally] Really the only bad moments in our training involved the press. The press was an added
pressure on the flight for me and whereas NASA appeared to be very enlightened about flying women astronauts, the press didn’t appear to be. The things that they were concerned with were not the same things
that I was concerned with. - [Gloria] For instance,
the bathroom facilities. - [Sally] The bathroom facilities. - [Gloria] How much
did you get asked that? - [Sally] Just about every
interview I got asked that. Everybody wanted to know about what kind of makeup I was taking up. They didn’t care about how well-prepared I was to operate the arm or deploy communications satellites. - [Gloria] Did NASA try to prepare you for the press and the pressure? - [Sally] Unfortunately, no, they don’t. You know, in my case, they took a graduate student in physics who had spent her life in the basement of a physics department with oscilloscopes and suddenly put me in front of the press. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What do you
suppose are the dumbest kinds of questions you’ve
been asked to date? - [Sally] Without a doubt, I think the worst question
that I have gotten was whether I cried when we got malfunctions in the simulator. (laughing) No. - [Gloria] That surpassed even the one about whether you’re going
to wear a bra or not. Did somebody really ask you that? - [Sally] No. The press, I think, decided
that that was a good question for someone to have asked me and for me to have answered
but I never got that question. - [Gloria] And they made you
up quite a good response. Something about "in a
state of weightlessness "it doesn’t matter,"
or something like that? - [Sally] Yeah, it was
something like that. - [Gloria] They made up this whole thing? - [Sally] Yeah, I was
never asked that question. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What about your
feelings during the launch? Was there any time that the enormity of what was going on came over you? - [Sally] The moment of the launch, when the engines actually ignited and the solid rockets lit, everyone on the crew
was, for a few seconds, just overcome with what
was about to happen to us. But a year of training is a long time. A year of sitting in simulators and being told exactly
what’s going to happen. And you hear the sounds and
you feel the vibrations. And they prepare you
very well and it worked. We were able to overcome being overcome and do the things that
we were supposed to do. - [Gloria] Just watching
there at the launch, there were people with tears
streaming down their faces, people I never would have expected and yet they were all very moved by, I guess, the human audacity of it. - [Sally] I think that to imagine, when you see the long trail of flame, and then to imagine that there are really people inside
that, that’s really something. Inside, of course, you don’t see the long trail of flame and what you’re feeling is
really more of an exhilaration. - [Gloria] Well, there are lots of people looking up there feeling proud, not only of you up there
but also on the ground. Thank you. - [Sally] Thank you. (inspirational instrumental music) - [Voiceover] This special

after the space shuttle is gonna be to be a space station. I would foresee a space station as being not just something
that is orbiting the earth and used for experimentation or whatever, but would also be used
as a launching platform back to the Moon or to Mars. And I think both of those are inevitable. I’m sure we’ll go back to the Moon and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before we send people to Mars. - [Gloria] Do you have any speculation about how long it might be perhaps before there are such things
as peopled space colonies? - [Sally] I’d guess that probably by the year 2000 there will be. I think that we’ll have a space station by the end of this decade. - [Gloria] On which it would be possible to live for long periods of time? - [Sally] Yes.

interview I got asked that. Everybody wanted to know about what kind of makeup I was taking up. They didn’t care about how well-prepared I was to operate the arm or deploy communications satellites. - [Gloria] Did NASA try to prepare you for the press and the pressure? - [Sally] Unfortunately, no, they don’t. You know, in my case, they took a graduate student in physics who had spent her life in the basement of a physics department with oscilloscopes and suddenly put me in front of the press. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What do you
suppose are the dumbest kinds of questions you’ve
been asked to date? - [Sally] Without a doubt, I think the worst question
that I have gotten was whether I cried when we got malfunctions in the simulator. (laughing) No. - [Gloria] That surpassed even the one about whether you’re going
to wear a bra or not. Did somebody really ask you that? - [Sally] No. The press, I think, decided
that that was a good question for someone to have asked me and for me to have answered
but I never got that question. - [Gloria] And they made you
up quite a good response. Something about "in a
state of weightlessness "it doesn’t matter,"
or something like that? - [Sally] Yeah, it was
something like that. - [Gloria] They made up this whole thing? - [Sally] Yeah, I was
never asked that question. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What about your
feelings during the launch? Was there any time that the enormity of what was going on came over you? - [Sally] The moment of the launch, when the engines actually ignited and the solid rockets lit, everyone on the crew
was, for a few seconds, just overcome with what
was about to happen to us. But a year of training is a long time. A year of sitting in simulators and being told exactly
what’s going to happen. And you hear the sounds and
you feel the vibrations. And they prepare you
very well and it worked. We were able to overcome being overcome and do the things that
we were supposed to do. - [Gloria] Just watching
there at the launch, there were people with tears
streaming down their faces, people I never would have expected and yet they were all very moved by, I guess, the human audacity of it. - [Sally] I think that to imagine, when you see the long trail of flame, and then to imagine that there are really people inside
that, that’s really something. Inside, of course, you don’t see the long trail of flame and what you’re feeling is
really more of an exhilaration. - [Gloria] Well, there are lots of people looking up there feeling proud, not only of you up there
but also on the ground. Thank you. - [Sally] Thank you. (inspirational instrumental music) - [Voiceover] This special

after the space shuttle is gonna be to be a space station. I would foresee a space station as being not just something
that is orbiting the earth and used for experimentation or whatever, but would also be used
as a launching platform back to the Moon or to Mars. And I think both of those are inevitable. I’m sure we’ll go back to the Moon and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before we send people to Mars. - [Gloria] Do you have any speculation about how long it might be perhaps before there are such things
as peopled space colonies? - [Sally] I’d guess that probably by the year 2000 there will be. I think that we’ll have a space station by the end of this decade. - [Gloria] On which it would be possible to live for long periods of time? - [Sally] Yes.

**Transcript**:
Ah, spring. Grass growing, flowers blooming,
trees growing new leaves, but if you get allergies, this explosion of new life probably
inspires more dread than joy. Step outside, and within minutes,
you're sneezing and congested. Your nose is running, your eyes are swollen and watery, your throat is itchy. For you and millions of others,
it's seasonal allergy time. So what's behind this onslaught of mucus? The answer lies within you. It's your immune system. Seasonal allergies, also called hay fever,
or allergic rhinitis, are a hypersensitive immune response
to something that's not actually harmful. Pollen from trees and grass, and mold spores from tiny fungi
find their way into your mucous membranes and your body attacks 
these innocuous travelers the same way it would infectious bacteria. The immune system has a memory. When a foreign substance gets tagged
as threatening, white blood cells produce 
customized antibodies that will recognize the offender
the next time around. They then promptly recruit
the body's defense team. But sometimes, the immune system
accidentally discriminates against harmless substances,
like pollen. When it wafts in again, antibodies
on the surface of white blood cells recognize it and latch on. This triggers the cell to release
inflammatory chemicals, like histamine, which stimulate nerve cells, and cause blood vessels in the mucous 
membranes to swell and leak fluid. In other words, itchiness, sneezing,
congestion, and a runny nose. Allergies usually, but not always, show up
for the first time during childhood. But why do some people get allergies
and others don't? Allergies tend to run in families,
so genetics may be one culprit. In fact, errors in a gene that helps
regulate the immune system are associated 
with higher rates of allergies. The environment 
you grow up in matters, too. Being exposed to an allergen as a baby makes you less likely to actually develop
an allergy to it. People who grow up on farms, in big families, and in the developing world also tend
to have fewer allergies, although there are plenty of exceptions,
partly thanks to genetics. One theory is that as children, they encounter more of the microbes
and parasites that co-evolved with traditional
hunter-gatherer societies. Called the hygiene hypothesis, the idea is that when the immune system isn't exposed 
to the familiar cast of microbes, it'll keep itself busy mounting
defenses against harmless substances, like pollen. Another theory is that an immune system
toughened up by a barrage of pathogens is less likely to overreact to allergens. Pollen is a common offender,
just because we encounter so much of it, but there's a long list of substances: dust, animal dander, insect venom, medications, certain foods, that can send your immune system
into overdrive. Some of these reactions can be scary. An allergy can develop
into full-blown anaphylaxis, which typically brings on severe swelling, shortness of breath, and very low blood pressure. It can be deadly. The body can even have 
an allergic reaction to itself causing auto-immune disorders, like multiple sclerosis, lupus,
and type 1 diabetes. But even non-life threatening allergy
symptoms can make you miserable, so what can you do about it? Medications can help reduce the symptoms. The most common ones keep histamines
from binding to your cells. These antihistamines 
stop the inflammation response. Steroids can help dial down 
the immune system. Another more permanent option
is immunotherapy. Deliberate, controlled exposure to gradually increasing 
amounts of an allergen can teach the immune system
that it isn't dangerous after all. And if you're really adventurous,
there's a less traditional option: intestinal parasites. When hookworms sink their teeth
into the intestinal wall, they secrete chemicals 
that blunt the immune system. Some studies suggest that hookworms
can treat allergies, which may be another reason allergies are more common 
in industrialized countries where hookworms are few
and far between. Of course, you can always just wait
your seasonal allergies out. The spring pollen onslaught dwindles
by mid-summer, just in time for ragweed season.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that involves the immune response and cell types.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match, as it discusses the immune response and the production of customized antibodies. However, it does not explicitly mention cell types.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that explicitly asks about the type of cells involved in the immune response, with options that include white blood cells, red blood cells, skin cells, and lung cells.

Index: 2 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
Ah, spring. Grass growing, flowers blooming,
trees growing new leaves, but if you get allergies, this explosion of new life probably
inspires more dread than joy. Step outside, and within minutes,
you're sneezing and congested. Your nose is running, your eyes are swollen and watery, your throat is itchy. For you and millions of others,
it's seasonal allergy time. So what's behind this onslaught of mucus? The answer lies within you. It's your immune system. Seasonal allergies, also called hay fever,
or allergic rhinitis, are a hypersensitive immune response
to something that's not actually harmful. Pollen from trees and grass, and mold spores from tiny fungi
find their way into your mucous membranes and your body attacks 
these innocuous travelers the same way it would infectious bacteria. The immune system has a memory. When a foreign substance gets tagged
as threatening, white blood cells produce 
customized antibodies that will recognize the offender
the next time around. They then promptly recruit
the body's defense team. But sometimes, the immune system
accidentally discriminates against harmless substances,
like pollen. When it wafts in again, antibodies
on the surface of white blood cells recognize it and latch on. This triggers the cell to release
inflammatory chemicals, like histamine, which stimulate nerve cells, and cause blood vessels in the mucous 
membranes to swell and leak fluid. In other words, itchiness, sneezing,
congestion, and a runny nose. Allergies usually, but not always, show up
for the first time during childhood. But why do some people get allergies
and others don't? Allergies tend to run in families,
so genetics may be one culprit. In fact, errors in a gene that helps
regulate the immune system are associated 
with higher rates of allergies. The environment 
you grow up in matters, too. Being exposed to an allergen as a baby makes you less likely to actually develop
an allergy to it. People who grow up on farms, in big families, and in the developing world also tend
to have fewer allergies, although there are plenty of exceptions,
partly thanks to genetics. One theory is that as children, they encounter more of the microbes
and parasites that co-evolved with traditional
hunter-gatherer societies. Called the hygiene hypothesis, the idea is that when the immune system isn't exposed 
to the familiar cast of microbes, it'll keep itself busy mounting
defenses against harmless substances, like pollen. Another theory is that an immune system
toughened up by a barrage of pathogens is less likely to overreact to allergens. Pollen is a common offender,
just because we encounter so much of it, but there's a long list of substances: dust, animal dander, insect venom, medications, certain foods, that can send your immune system
into overdrive. Some of these reactions can be scary. An allergy can develop
into full-blown anaphylaxis, which typically brings on severe swelling, shortness of breath, and very low blood pressure. It can be deadly. The body can even have 
an allergic reaction to itself causing auto-immune disorders, like multiple sclerosis, lupus,
and type 1 diabetes. But even non-life threatening allergy
symptoms can make you miserable, so what can you do about it? Medications can help reduce the symptoms. The most common ones keep histamines
from binding to your cells. These antihistamines 
stop the inflammation response. Steroids can help dial down 
the immune system. Another more permanent option
is immunotherapy. Deliberate, controlled exposure to gradually increasing 
amounts of an allergen can teach the immune system
that it isn't dangerous after all. And if you're really adventurous,
there's a less traditional option: intestinal parasites. When hookworms sink their teeth
into the intestinal wall, they secrete chemicals 
that blunt the immune system. Some studies suggest that hookworms
can treat allergies, which may be another reason allergies are more common 
in industrialized countries where hookworms are few
and far between. Of course, you can always just wait
your seasonal allergies out. The spring pollen onslaught dwindles
by mid-summer, just in time for ragweed season.

**Transcript**:
Ralph Waldo Emerson is the father of
American literature. In a series of strikingly original essays, written in
the mid-nineteenth century, he fundamentally changed the way that
America saw its cultural and artistic possibilities, and he enabled a
separation from transatlantic literary traditions. "We have listened too long...", he wrote, "...to the Courtly muses of Europe." Emerson's abjection of cultural
traditions brought about what one contemporary called: "America's
intellectual declaration of independence." and he established generational conflict
and transformation as commanding ideas in American literature. Emerson himself hardly seemed destined
to fit a revolutionary mold. He was born in 1803, the son of a Boston
preacher, and was descended from a line of New England ministers that went back
to the bedrock of seventeenth-century Puritanism. When his father died in 1811, 
his mother took in boarders to pay the rent. Still, she sent her son to Harvard in
1817, and then Harvard divinity school to train for the priesthood in 1825. As a young man, Emerson was strongly influenced by a
remarkable aunt of his: Mary Moody Emerson, who though self-taught, had read
everything from Shakespeare to the romantics and it formed a unique
religious perspective based on piety nature and literature, that would
resonate powerfully in the life and work of her nephew. So when Emerson was ordained in 1829,
marrying the love of his life Ellen Tucker in the same year, he was
already unsatisfied with the formal nature of New England religious
orthodoxy. When Ellen died of tuberculosis just two years later, he
resigned from the church and soon after embarked on a trip to Europe. Leaving on Christmas Day 1832,
two crucial things happened to Emerson on that tour of europe. In Paris, he went to the famous "Jardin des Plantes", a botanical and zoological garden. There he had an epiphany. Writing in his journal that: "I feel the
centipede in me, the Cayman, carp, eagle and Fox... ...I am moved by strange sympathies. I say
continually: I will be a naturalist.". Emerson's insight was that nature is in us, a part of us, and not just its higher forms, but in all its grotesquerie and
wildness. The second thing that happened on that
tour, was that Emerson met the English romantic poets: Samuel Taylor Coleridge
and William Wordsworth, and found them rather ordinary, dry 
and conservative men. The insight that Emerson drew from this, was that if great men could be so
ordinary, why should not ordinary men be great? as he would write a few years later, meek young men grow up in libraries, believing
it their duty, to accept the views which Cicero, Locke, Bacon have given. Forgetful
that Cicero, Locke and Bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote
these books. Emerson had found two ideas that would
guide his life's work. That man and nature are one and that everyone can
recognize that they are a uniquely, significant human being. On his return to America in 1833, Emerson
became a professional lecturer giving talks on natural history and literature in halls around New England. He remarried and had several children, presenting a stolid, bourgeois
appearance to the world. But his inner life was full of
turbulence and originality. In his 1836 essay, "Nature", Emerson outlined the germ of a new
philosophy, a key element of this, was the importance of American originality. In
its opening lines, Emerson wrote: "Our age is retrospective, it builds the sepulchres
of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories and criticism. The foregoing
generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we
also enjoy an original relation to the universe?". America, needed to stop looking
back to its European heritage and start looking about it self. No past moment was more important,
than the present moment. No tradition was more important, than
novelty. No generation, was better than the current generation. Everything that
matters is here now insisted Emerson, and that here was: America. This was an extension of Emerson's ideas,
about the significance of the individual that came under the heading of what he
called "self-reliance". Everywhere Emerson looked, he saw people leading lives that were based on tradition, that were limited by religious forms and social
habits. No one could be themselves, Emerson
thought, because they were all too busy being what they were supposed to be. Emerson wanted to get rid of each of
these burdens: the past, religion and social forms, so that each person could
find out who they truly were. As he put it: "History is an impertinence and an injury; Our religion, we have not chosen, but
society has chosen for us... And... ...Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the
manhood of every one of its members." We must, he argued, live from within
trusting nothing but our own intuitions. For, as he concluded... ...nothing is at last sacred but the
integrity of your own mind. This leaves open a vital question: What
is your nature... ...once you've rid yourself of history,
tradition and religion? What can be said is that it isn't
necessarily self-indulgence, haterism or narcissism. Rather, it's the surrender to that force
which Emerson recognized back in the Jardin des Plantes. An obedience to nature itself. By nature, Emerson seem to mean the natural world: 
plants, animals, rocks and sky, but what he really meant was God. Emerson was a "Pantheist". That is, someone
who believe that God exists in every part of creation, from the smallest grain
of sand to the stars. But also crucially that the divine spark
is in each of us. In following ourselves, we are therefore not merely being fickle or selfish, we are rather, releasing a divine will, that history, society and organized religion normally hide from us. The individual as
Emerson writes "is a God in ruins". But we have it within us, by casting off all
custom to rebuild ourselves Emerson makes this Pantheist connection,
explicit in what are perhaps his most famous lines. "Crossing a bear common, in
snow puddles at twilight under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any
occurrence of special good fortune, I've enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am
glad to the brink of fear, standing on the bare ground, my head
bathed by the blythe air and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes... ...I become a transparent eyeball... ...I am nothing... ...I see all. The currents of
the universal being circulate through me... ...I am part or particle of God! In the Romantic tradition on which
Emerson draws, it is the sublime, great mountains, rushing torrance, dark forests, which releases the inner vision as we find ourselves in all of them. For Emerson, it's a perfectly dull walk across an
ordinary common on a dark winter's evening that brings him, to the brink of fear. Emerson's God, is in the snow puddles too. Stood there on the common, he disappears, becoming nothing as the
currents of God flow through him. What is left is just, a transparent
eyeball. Such transcendent moments are rare, but they reveal an essential
connection between nature, God and man. They are one. They also give Emerson a proper sense of
each individual's importance, as a part of God. Transcendentalism became the name of the
movement that grew up around Emerson, at this time. Another aspect of the epiphany
that was to have a profound effect on American literature, was the
emphasis on the value of the ordinary. What Emerson put forward in essays like
"The American scholar" and "the poet", was that the American every day, was a proper
subject for literature. This was because for Emerson, the
transcendentalist God is everywhere, and it's the poet's job to reveal this. "There is no object...", he wrote, "...so foul that
intense light will not make it beautiful." "...Even a corpse has its own beauty." This
coming from a man who had opened his first wife's tomb a year after her death... ...to take a look! The great American writers, who followed Emerson, were liberated by his work to
look around and write about what they saw and how they lived, transforming the everyday into a vital
symbol of something higher and more elusive. Henry David Thoreau's two years
at Walden Pond, became a book that showed the cosmos reflected in the depths of
the waters of a mere pond. The poet Walt Whitman said: "I was
simmering, simmering, simmering... ...Emerson brought me to a boil." Emily Dickinson heard a fly and could
write of the other side of death. The novelist Herman Melville, took a whaling voyage, and made it an allegory
of American imperialism and the defiance of nature. In the 20th century, the
American critic Harold Bloom looked back at Emerson's originality and saw in it
the origin of: "The strong tradition of American poets." From Robert Frost and
Wallace Stevens to John Ashbery, Emerson's legacy to american literature
and culture and indeed to the world, was one of ceaseless invention and forward
momentum. As he put it: "I unsettle all things... ...no facts are to me sacred, none are profane... ...I simply experiment an endless seeker
with no past at my back." people of Paul pronouncing his name if you don't
speak German it's not at all obvious how you're supposed to say it a safe bet is

**Transcript**:
Ralph Waldo Emerson is the father of
American literature. In a series of strikingly original essays, written in
the mid-nineteenth century, he fundamentally changed the way that
America saw its cultural and artistic possibilities, and he enabled a
separation from transatlantic literary traditions. "We have listened too long...", he wrote, "...to the Courtly muses of Europe." Emerson's abjection of cultural
traditions brought about what one contemporary called: "America's
intellectual declaration of independence." and he established generational conflict
and transformation as commanding ideas in American literature. Emerson himself hardly seemed destined
to fit a revolutionary mold. He was born in 1803, the son of a Boston
preacher, and was descended from a line of New England ministers that went back
to the bedrock of seventeenth-century Puritanism. When his father died in 1811, 
his mother took in boarders to pay the rent. Still, she sent her son to Harvard in
1817, and then Harvard divinity school to train for the priesthood in 1825. As a young man, Emerson was strongly influenced by a
remarkable aunt of his: Mary Moody Emerson, who though self-taught, had read
everything from Shakespeare to the romantics and it formed a unique
religious perspective based on piety nature and literature, that would
resonate powerfully in the life and work of her nephew. So when Emerson was ordained in 1829,
marrying the love of his life Ellen Tucker in the same year, he was
already unsatisfied with the formal nature of New England religious
orthodoxy. When Ellen died of tuberculosis just two years later, he
resigned from the church and soon after embarked on a trip to Europe. Leaving on Christmas Day 1832,
two crucial things happened to Emerson on that tour of europe. In Paris, he went to the famous "Jardin des Plantes", a botanical and zoological garden. There he had an epiphany. Writing in his journal that: "I feel the
centipede in me, the Cayman, carp, eagle and Fox... ...I am moved by strange sympathies. I say
continually: I will be a naturalist.". Emerson's insight was that nature is in us, a part of us, and not just its higher forms, but in all its grotesquerie and
wildness. The second thing that happened on that
tour, was that Emerson met the English romantic poets: Samuel Taylor Coleridge
and William Wordsworth, and found them rather ordinary, dry 
and conservative men. The insight that Emerson drew from this, was that if great men could be so
ordinary, why should not ordinary men be great? as he would write a few years later, meek young men grow up in libraries, believing
it their duty, to accept the views which Cicero, Locke, Bacon have given. Forgetful
that Cicero, Locke and Bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote
these books. Emerson had found two ideas that would
guide his life's work. That man and nature are one and that everyone can
recognize that they are a uniquely, significant human being. On his return to America in 1833, Emerson
became a professional lecturer giving talks on natural history and literature in halls around New England. He remarried and had several children, presenting a stolid, bourgeois
appearance to the world. But his inner life was full of
turbulence and originality. In his 1836 essay, "Nature", Emerson outlined the germ of a new
philosophy, a key element of this, was the importance of American originality. In
its opening lines, Emerson wrote: "Our age is retrospective, it builds the sepulchres
of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories and criticism. The foregoing
generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we
also enjoy an original relation to the universe?". America, needed to stop looking
back to its European heritage and start looking about it self. No past moment was more important,
than the present moment. No tradition was more important, than
novelty. No generation, was better than the current generation. Everything that
matters is here now insisted Emerson, and that here was: America. This was an extension of Emerson's ideas,
about the significance of the individual that came under the heading of what he
called "self-reliance". Everywhere Emerson looked, he saw people leading lives that were based on tradition, that were limited by religious forms and social
habits. No one could be themselves, Emerson
thought, because they were all too busy being what they were supposed to be. Emerson wanted to get rid of each of
these burdens: the past, religion and social forms, so that each person could
find out who they truly were. As he put it: "History is an impertinence and an injury; Our religion, we have not chosen, but
society has chosen for us... And... ...Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the
manhood of every one of its members." We must, he argued, live from within
trusting nothing but our own intuitions. For, as he concluded... ...nothing is at last sacred but the
integrity of your own mind. This leaves open a vital question: What
is your nature... ...once you've rid yourself of history,
tradition and religion? What can be said is that it isn't
necessarily self-indulgence, haterism or narcissism. Rather, it's the surrender to that force
which Emerson recognized back in the Jardin des Plantes. An obedience to nature itself. By nature, Emerson seem to mean the natural world: 
plants, animals, rocks and sky, but what he really meant was God. Emerson was a "Pantheist". That is, someone
who believe that God exists in every part of creation, from the smallest grain
of sand to the stars. But also crucially that the divine spark
is in each of us. In following ourselves, we are therefore not merely being fickle or selfish, we are rather, releasing a divine will, that history, society and organized religion normally hide from us. The individual as
Emerson writes "is a God in ruins". But we have it within us, by casting off all
custom to rebuild ourselves Emerson makes this Pantheist connection,
explicit in what are perhaps his most famous lines. "Crossing a bear common, in
snow puddles at twilight under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any
occurrence of special good fortune, I've enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am
glad to the brink of fear, standing on the bare ground, my head
bathed by the blythe air and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes... ...I become a transparent eyeball... ...I am nothing... ...I see all. The currents of
the universal being circulate through me... ...I am part or particle of God! In the Romantic tradition on which
Emerson draws, it is the sublime, great mountains, rushing torrance, dark forests, which releases the inner vision as we find ourselves in all of them. For Emerson, it's a perfectly dull walk across an
ordinary common on a dark winter's evening that brings him, to the brink of fear. Emerson's God, is in the snow puddles too. Stood there on the common, he disappears, becoming nothing as the
currents of God flow through him. What is left is just, a transparent
eyeball. Such transcendent moments are rare, but they reveal an essential
connection between nature, God and man. They are one. They also give Emerson a proper sense of
each individual's importance, as a part of God. Transcendentalism became the name of the
movement that grew up around Emerson, at this time. Another aspect of the epiphany
that was to have a profound effect on American literature, was the
emphasis on the value of the ordinary. What Emerson put forward in essays like
"The American scholar" and "the poet", was that the American every day, was a proper
subject for literature. This was because for Emerson, the
transcendentalist God is everywhere, and it's the poet's job to reveal this. "There is no object...", he wrote, "...so foul that
intense light will not make it beautiful." "...Even a corpse has its own beauty." This
coming from a man who had opened his first wife's tomb a year after her death... ...to take a look! The great American writers, who followed Emerson, were liberated by his work to
look around and write about what they saw and how they lived, transforming the everyday into a vital
symbol of something higher and more elusive. Henry David Thoreau's two years
at Walden Pond, became a book that showed the cosmos reflected in the depths of
the waters of a mere pond. The poet Walt Whitman said: "I was
simmering, simmering, simmering... ...Emerson brought me to a boil." Emily Dickinson heard a fly and could
write of the other side of death. The novelist Herman Melville, took a whaling voyage, and made it an allegory
of American imperialism and the defiance of nature. In the 20th century, the
American critic Harold Bloom looked back at Emerson's originality and saw in it
the origin of: "The strong tradition of American poets." From Robert Frost and
Wallace Stevens to John Ashbery, Emerson's legacy to american literature
and culture and indeed to the world, was one of ceaseless invention and forward
momentum. As he put it: "I unsettle all things... ...no facts are to me sacred, none are profane... ...I simply experiment an endless seeker
with no past at my back." people of Paul pronouncing his name if you don't

It's easy to forget how vast and deep
the ocean really is. About 60% of it is actually
a cold and dark region known as the deep ocean. And it reaches down to 11,000 meters. Yet, this remote zone is also one
of the greatest habitats on Earth, harboring a huge diversity of life, from giant squids and goblin sharks to minuscule animals 
smaller than a millimeter. How do so many species thrive
in this underwater world? Over the decades, intrepid scientists
have ventured there to find out. Traveling down through the water column, pressure increases 
and light begins to wane. At 200 meters, photosynthesis stops and temperature decreases 
from surface temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius. By 1000 meters, normal sunlight
has disappeared altogether. Without light, life as we know it
seems impossible. That's why in 1844, the naturalist 
Edward Forbes wrote his Azoic Theory, Azoic, meaning without animals. Forbes was sure that nothing could survive
below 600 meters on account of the lack of light. Of course, the discovery 
of deep-sea species proved him wrong. What Forbes failed to take into account
is something called marine snow, which sounds much nicer than it is. Marine snow is basically organic matter, things like particles of dead algae,
plants, and animals, drifting down into the depths and acting as food for deep-sea animals. Largely thanks to that, 
abundant life forms exist in the darkness, adapting to a harsh reality where only
the weird and wonderful can survive. Fish with cavernous mouths, spiky teeth jutting from their jaws, and lamp-like structures 
protruding from their heads, like the anglerfish which entices prey
with its misleading glow. Several sea creatures have perfected
this lightning technique known as bioluminescence, using it to lure prey, distract predators, or attract mates. Some creatures use it for camoflauge. In parts of the water column where
only faint blue light filters through, animals bioluminesce to match the glow. Predators or prey looking up
from below are deceived by this camoflauge, unable to see the creatures silhouette. Such otherworldly adaptations also arise
from the need to locate and snatch up food before it drifts away. Some sea animals, like jellyfish,
comb jellies and salps can migrate between depths partially because 
their 90% water consistency allows them to withstand immense pressure. But they're the exception. Most deep-sea creatures are confined
to a narrow range in the water column where nutrients are scarce since the food drifting downwards
from the surface rapidly sinks to the sea floor. Plunging all the way down,
we find more exotic creatures. Some take on dwarfism, a trait that transforms them 
into miniature versions of animals we see closer to the surface. It's thought that reduced 
food availability causes the shrinkage. Only a tiny fraction of the food produced
at the surface reaches the sea floor, so being small gives animals
a low energy requirement and an adaptive advantage. And yet, the sea is also the land
of giants. Here, gargantuan squids can reach
18 meters long. Isopods scuttle around the sea floor
like enormous wood lice. There are long-limbed 
Japanese spider crabs, and oarfish, whose bodies stretch
to 15 meters. This trait is known as gigantism,
and it's something of a mystery. It's thought that high oxygen levels
may drive extreme growth in some species, while the colder temperatures promote
longer life spans, giving animals the opportunity 
to grow massive. Many of these exotic sea beasts will never
experience sunlight. Some will venture up through
the water column to feed, and a few will actually break the waves, reminding us at the surface about the incredible survival skills
of the ocean's deepest inhabitants. Humans still have an astounding
95% of the ocean left to explore. So those depths remain a great mystery. What other untold wonders lie far below,
and which ones will we discover next?

While there isn't a direct match, Question 3: "What is 'marine snow' in the context of the ocean?" touches on the idea that the deep sea, despite being thought to be uninhabitable, actually supports life due to organic matter (marine snow) drifting down into the depths. This concept is related to the "Azoic theory" in that it explains why the theory was incorrect.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of discussing deep-sea conditions or theories, I would say Question 3 is the closest match, but with a significant caveat that it doesn't directly address the "Azoic theory."

A more accurate approach would be to acknowledge that none of the provided generated MCQs adequately match the ground truth MCQ regarding the "Azoic theory."

It's easy to forget how vast and deep
the ocean really is. About 60% of it is actually
a cold and dark region known as the deep ocean. And it reaches down to 11,000 meters. Yet, this remote zone is also one
of the greatest habitats on Earth, harboring a huge diversity of life, from giant squids and goblin sharks to minuscule animals 
smaller than a millimeter. How do so many species thrive
in this underwater world? Over the decades, intrepid scientists
have ventured there to find out. Traveling down through the water column, pressure increases 
and light begins to wane. At 200 meters, photosynthesis stops and temperature decreases 
from surface temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius. By 1000 meters, normal sunlight
has disappeared altogether. Without light, life as we know it
seems impossible. That's why in 1844, the naturalist 
Edward Forbes wrote his Azoic Theory, Azoic, meaning without animals. Forbes was sure that nothing could survive
below 600 meters on account of the lack of light. Of course, the discovery 
of deep-sea species proved him wrong. What Forbes failed to take into account
is something called marine snow, which sounds much nicer than it is. Marine snow is basically organic matter, things like particles of dead algae,
plants, and animals, drifting down into the depths and acting as food for deep-sea animals. Largely thanks to that, 
abundant life forms exist in the darkness, adapting to a harsh reality where only
the weird and wonderful can survive. Fish with cavernous mouths, spiky teeth jutting from their jaws, and lamp-like structures 
protruding from their heads, like the anglerfish which entices prey
with its misleading glow. Several sea creatures have perfected
this lightning technique known as bioluminescence, using it to lure prey, distract predators, or attract mates. Some creatures use it for camoflauge. In parts of the water column where
only faint blue light filters through, animals bioluminesce to match the glow. Predators or prey looking up
from below are deceived by this camoflauge, unable to see the creatures silhouette. Such otherworldly adaptations also arise
from the need to locate and snatch up food before it drifts away. Some sea animals, like jellyfish,
comb jellies and salps can migrate between depths partially because 
their 90% water consistency allows them to withstand immense pressure. But they're the exception. Most deep-sea creatures are confined
to a narrow range in the water column where nutrients are scarce since the food drifting downwards
from the surface rapidly sinks to the sea floor. Plunging all the way down,
we find more exotic creatures. Some take on dwarfism, a trait that transforms them 
into miniature versions of animals we see closer to the surface. It's thought that reduced 
food availability causes the shrinkage. Only a tiny fraction of the food produced
at the surface reaches the sea floor, so being small gives animals
a low energy requirement and an adaptive advantage. And yet, the sea is also the land
of giants. Here, gargantuan squids can reach
18 meters long. Isopods scuttle around the sea floor
like enormous wood lice. There are long-limbed 
Japanese spider crabs, and oarfish, whose bodies stretch
to 15 meters. This trait is known as gigantism,
and it's something of a mystery. It's thought that high oxygen levels
may drive extreme growth in some species, while the colder temperatures promote
longer life spans, giving animals the opportunity 
to grow massive. Many of these exotic sea beasts will never
experience sunlight. Some will venture up through
the water column to feed, and a few will actually break the waves, reminding us at the surface about the incredible survival skills
of the ocean's deepest inhabitants. Humans still have an astounding
95% of the ocean left to explore. So those depths remain a great mystery. What other untold wonders lie far below,
and which ones will we discover next?

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the size of a giant squid, which is a specific example of gigantism in deep-sea creatures.

The generated MCQ that comes closest to this topic is Question 7: "What is thought to drive extreme growth in some deep-sea species?" While this question does not directly ask about the size of a giant squid, it does relate to the concept of gigantism and the factors that contribute to it.

Therefore, I would suggest that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe
be dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of
its expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that
scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe
must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point
it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up
and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but
we call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and
then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have
decided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,
and we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they
lead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe
has been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces
created everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,
so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,
but here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion
accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity
can’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like
galaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects
expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep
them together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand
faster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,
and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless
lonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between
the Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays
intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period
of time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?
Let’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the
state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but
over time, they will cool down and disintegrate,
until it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets
bigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations
of stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,
so the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;
 black holes will slowly degenerate
and evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a
dilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
at this point; entropy is at its maximum and
the universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might
be possible that after an incredibly
long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy
decrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to
a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most
likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the
universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so
let’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account. Subtitles by the Amara.org community

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the speed at which space expands in the Big Rip scenario. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the specific speed, Question 3 mentions the Big Rip scenario and describes it as "The universe expands until gravity can't hold objects together." This is related to the concept of space expanding in the Big Rip scenario, but it does not specifically ask about the speed.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 3 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe
be dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of
its expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that
scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe
must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point
it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up
and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but
we call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and
then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have
decided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,
and we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they
lead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe
has been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces
created everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,
so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,
but here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion
accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity
can’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like
galaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects
expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep
them together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand
faster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,
and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless
lonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between
the Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays
intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period
of time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?
Let’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the
state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but
over time, they will cool down and disintegrate,
until it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets
bigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations
of stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,
so the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;
 black holes will slowly degenerate
and evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a
dilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
at this point; entropy is at its maximum and
the universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might
be possible that after an incredibly
long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy
decrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to
a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most
likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the
universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so
let’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account. Subtitles by the Amara.org community

a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most
likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the
universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so
let’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account. Subtitles by the Amara.org community

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the speed at which space expands in the Big Rip scenario. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the specific speed, Question 3 mentions the Big Rip scenario and describes it as "The universe expands until gravity can't hold objects together." This is related to the concept of space expanding in the Big Rip scenario, but it does not specifically ask about the speed.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 3 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe
be dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of
its expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that
scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe
must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point
it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up
and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but
we call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and
then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have
decided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,
and we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they
lead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe
has been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces
created everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,
so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,
but here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion
accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity
can’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like
galaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects
expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep
them together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand
faster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,
and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless
lonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between
the Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays
intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period
of time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?
Let’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the
state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but
over time, they will cool down and disintegrate,
until it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets
bigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations
of stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,
so the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;
 black holes will slowly degenerate
and evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a
dilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
at this point; entropy is at its maximum and
the universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might
be possible that after an incredibly
long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy
decrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to
a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] We’d like to think that we walk through
our lives completely conscious, free to choose whatever we like, totally completely in control. Not even close. Our bodies leave a lot to autopilot, which
is a good thing, because imagine having to regulate your heartbeat and your breathing
and your digestive system and your body temperature, all while not peeing your pants or falling
down. That would be hard. Many of those involuntary actions are mysterious,
annoying, just plain weird. Here are five of the human body’s strangest
out of control behaviors. Start typing “why does my” into Google
and the top result is an eye-opener. Involuntary twitching of the muscles around
the eye has a number of causes including dry eyes, caffeine, bright lights, and just like
during a tough workout, from simple fatigue. It’s usually totally harmless and eventually
goes away on its own and is a good hint that you’ve probably been looking at that screen
enough for one day. Looking at bright light can cause more than
an eye twitch. In Aristotle’s "Book of Problems" he asks “Why is it that one sneezes more
after one has looked at the sun” proving that people have been asking
a lot of the same questions for a long time and that no one told Aristotle that you’re
not supposed to stare at the sun. Like, ever. Don’t do it. The so-called photic sneeze reflex, AKA the
Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst, abbreviated "ACHOO"… yes, seriously… is
experienced by about 1 in 4 people, leading scientists to believe it is genetically heritable. While the exact cause hasn’t been pinpointed,
many scientists think it’s due crosstalk between the optic nerve and nerve that feeds
the tickling sensation in your nose. The visual cortex of sun-sneezing people is also prone
to overstimulation, which might send the sneeze sensing parts of their brain haywire. Have you ever been just about to go to sleep,
walking through the gates to Dreamland, only to have the floor pulled out from under you
and you’re suddenly falling and then you wake up! This frustrating sleep starts have another
cool medical name, hypnagogic myoclonus. When we drift off, the areas of our brain
that control motor function are inactivated in favor of those that control our sleep cycles,
which is why you can dream about riding your bike without actually moving your feet. As the sleepy part of your brain fight with
the awake and moving parts of your brain, the battle can spontaneously tip back in favor
of the motor control side and suddenly you’re like… WHOA, I'm awake. Sleep starts aren’t the only myocloni that
we experience. Hiccups are an uncontrollable contraction
of the diaphragm muscle that we use to draw air into our lungs. About a quarter second after that muscle contracts,
the vocal cords snap shut, creating the characteristic [hic]. Scientists still aren’t sure what causes
em, but possible explanations include hiccups being an evolutionary remnant from a few hundred
million years ago when our ancestors still had to pump water over their gills. Or, since hiccups mainly happen in mammals,
that they started as a way for nursing infants to clear air from their stomachs. If you want to get rid of hiccups, it seems
that increasing the amount of CO2 in your blood can do the job, which is common remedies
include drinking water, holding our breath, or breathing into a paper bag. Yawning, another long, slow, involuntary form
of breathing, is common throughout the animal kingdom and even happens in the womb. We know it’s associated with sleep and boredom,
but that doesn’t explain why it happens, and like most human behaviors, if you stop
and think about yawning long enough it starts to become a really, really weird thing to
do. Hippocrates believed that yawns released noxious
fumes that had built up in the body, but modern medicine has shown us that usually happens
on the other end of the body. We also know that about 50% of people who
observe a yawn will yawn in response, so it’s thought to be a social cue to synchronize
biological clocks. One theory says yawns might even cool the
brain slightly to make us more alert as we get bored or sleepy. Even watching someone talk for extended periods
of time can induce yawning, so next time you’re getting bored in class, tell your teacher
it’s Mother Nature’s fault. Finally, I’ll leave you with one bonus behavior:
post-micturition convulsion syndrome, or the pee shivers. This is another behavior for which scientists
haven’t quite shaken out all the details, but some believe its simply because we’re
exposing sensitive areas of our body to the cold while we expel some internal warmth. They might also arise from a bit of conflict
between our autonomous nervous system that’s usually quietly keeping all that pee inside
and the part of our conscious mind that’s in charge of the plumbing at that moment. These weird, wild, and often twitchy behaviors
may defy nice, neat explanations, and yes, sometimes they are very annoying, but in the
great movie that is life, they’re a nice reminder of all the amazing things going on
behind the scenes. Here’s a reflex action: You click subscribe,

**Transcript**:
Like many heroes of Greek myths, the philosopher Hippasus was rumored to
have been mortally punished by the gods. But what was his crime? Did he murder guests, or disrupt a sacred ritual? No, Hippasus's transgression was
a mathematical proof: the discovery of irrational numbers. Hippasus belonged to a group
called the Pythagorean mathematicians who had a religious reverence for numbers. Their dictum of, "All is number," suggested that numbers 
were the building blocks of the Universe and part of this belief was that 
everything from cosmology and metaphysics to music and morals followed eternal rules describable as ratios of numbers. Thus, any number could be written
as such a ratio. 5 as 5/1, 0.5 as 1/2 and so on. Even an infinitely extending decimal like
this could be expressed exactly as 34/45. All of these are what we now call
rational numbers. But Hippasus found one number
that violated this harmonious rule, one that was not supposed to exist. The problem began with a simple shape, a square with each side 
measuring one unit. According to Pythagoras Theorem, the diagonal length 
would be square root of two, but try as he might, Hippasus could not
express this as a ratio of two integers. And instead of giving up, he decided
to prove it couldn't be done. Hippasus began by assuming that the
Pythagorean worldview was true, that root 2 could be expressed
as a ratio of two integers. He labeled these hypothetical integers
p and q. Assuming the ratio was reduced
to its simplest form, p and q could not have any common factors. To prove that root 2 was not rational, Hippasus just had to prove that
p/q cannot exist. So he multiplied both sides 
of the equation by q and squared both sides. which gave him this equation. Multiplying any number by 2
results in an even number, so p^2 had to be even. That couldn't be true if p was odd because an odd number times itself
is always odd, so p was even as well. Thus, p could be expressed as 2a,
where a is an integer. Substituting this into the equation
and simplifying gave q^2 = 2a^2 Once again, two times any number
produces an even number, so q^2 must have been even, and q must have been even as well, making both p and q even. But if that was true, then they had
a common factor of two, which contradicted the initial statement, and that's how Hippasus concluded
that no such ratio exists. That's called a proof by contradiction, and according to the legend, the gods did not appreciate 
being contradicted. Interestingly, even though we can't
express irrational numbers as ratios of integers, it is possible to precisely plot
some of them on the number line. Take root 2. All we need to do is form a right triangle
with two sides each measuring one unit. The hypotenuse has a length of root 2,
which can be extended along the line. We can then form another
right triangle with a base of that length
and a one unit height, and its hypotenuse would equal
root three, which can be extended 
along the line, as well. The key here is that decimals and ratios
are only ways to express numbers. Root 2 simply is the hypotenuse
of a right triangle with sides of a length one. Similarly, the famous irrational number pi is always equal 
to exactly what it represents, the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter. Approximations like 22/7, or 355/113 will never precisely equal pi. We'll never know what really happened
to Hippasus, but what we do know is that his discovery
revolutionized mathematics. So whatever the myths may say,
don't be afraid to explore the impossible.

**Question 2: What was the mathematical concept that Hippasus discovered, which led to his punishment? Options: A. Rational numbers, B. Irrational numbers, C. Prime numbers, D. Composite numbers**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about identifying irrational numbers. But among the given options, Question 2 is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about identifying irrational numbers, but such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **2**, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

To create a more similar question, you could rephrase Question 2 to something like:

**Question: Which of the following numbers is an example of the mathematical concept discovered by Hippasus? Options: A) √2, B) 1/2, C) 4, D) 3/4**

Or, you could create a new question that directly asks about identifying irrational numbers, such as:

**Question: Which of the following numbers is irrational? Options: A) √2, B) 1/2, C) 4, D) 3/4**

If you line up the entire text 
of “Moby Dick,” which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns: like these words, which seem to predict the assassination
of Martin Luther King. Or these references 
to the 1997 death of Princess Di. So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet? The answer is no, and we know that thanks to a mathematical
principle called Ramsey theory. It's the reason we can find geometric
shapes in the night sky, it's why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number 
of hairs on their head, and it explains why patterns can be found
in just about any text... even Vanilla Ice lyrics. So what is Ramsey theory? Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure, some particular interesting pattern
among them is guaranteed to emerge. As a simple example, let’s look 
at what’s called the Party Problem— a classic illustration of Ramsey theory. Suppose there are at least six people
at a party. Amazingly enough, we can say for sure that some group of three of them
either all know each other, or have never met before, without knowing a single thing about them. We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities. Each point represents a person, and a line indicates 
that the pair know each other. Every pair only has two possibilities:
they either know each other or they don't. There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property 
that we're looking for. Six is the lowest number of guests
where that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns, but no easy way to find it. In this case, as the total number
of guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control. For instance, say you're trying
to find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people
who all know each other or all don't. Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually 
impossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this. That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities. A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms 
in the universe. Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer
to this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests. What this shows us 
is that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set. And with a very large set,
the possibilities are almost endless. Any four stars where no three 
lie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape. Expand that to the thousands 
of stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can
find all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them. So what are the chances of a text
concealing a prophecy? Well, when you factor
in  the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations 
and alternate spellings, they're pretty high. You can try it yourself. Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find. The mathematician T.S. Motzkin 
once remarked that, “while disorder is more probable 
in general, complete disorder is impossible." The sheer size of the universe guarantees
that some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns
and pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional
meaning where there may not be any. So while we may be awed by hidden messages
in everything from books, to pieces of toast, to the night sky, their real origin 
is usually our own minds.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although Question 9 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of wording, it captures the underlying idea and intent of the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the nature of Melville's writing and the emergence of patterns, while Question 9 asks about the underlying reason for the emergence of patterns and arrangements in large sets. Both questions relate to the idea that patterns can emerge naturally in large sets without necessarily having intentional meaning.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. Question 2 is about Ramsey theory, which is the main concept discussed in the transcript to explain the emergence of patterns. The correct option of Question 2, "Some particular interesting pattern," is closely related to the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the options provided in the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose another option that closely matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided for Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses whether Ramsey theory tells us how to find a particular structure in a given system.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: 2

However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the question of whether Ramsey theory provides a method for finding a particular structure in a given system, with options that match the ground truth MCQ (A. Yes, B. No).

**Transcript**:
If you line up the entire text 
of “Moby Dick,” which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns: like these words, which seem to predict the assassination
of Martin Luther King. Or these references 
to the 1997 death of Princess Di. So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet? The answer is no, and we know that thanks to a mathematical
principle called Ramsey theory. It's the reason we can find geometric
shapes in the night sky, it's why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number 
of hairs on their head, and it explains why patterns can be found
in just about any text... even Vanilla Ice lyrics. So what is Ramsey theory? Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure, some particular interesting pattern
among them is guaranteed to emerge. As a simple example, let’s look 
at what’s called the Party Problem— a classic illustration of Ramsey theory. Suppose there are at least six people
at a party. Amazingly enough, we can say for sure that some group of three of them
either all know each other, or have never met before, without knowing a single thing about them. We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities. Each point represents a person, and a line indicates 
that the pair know each other. Every pair only has two possibilities:
they either know each other or they don't. There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property 
that we're looking for. Six is the lowest number of guests
where that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns, but no easy way to find it. In this case, as the total number
of guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control. For instance, say you're trying
to find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people
who all know each other or all don't. Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually 
impossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this. That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities. A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms 
in the universe. Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer
to this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests. What this shows us 
is that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set. And with a very large set,
the possibilities are almost endless. Any four stars where no three 
lie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape. Expand that to the thousands 
of stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can
find all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them. So what are the chances of a text
concealing a prophecy? Well, when you factor
in  the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations 
and alternate spellings, they're pretty high. You can try it yourself. Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find. The mathematician T.S. Motzkin 
once remarked that, “while disorder is more probable 
in general, complete disorder is impossible." The sheer size of the universe guarantees
that some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns
and pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional
meaning where there may not be any. So while we may be awed by hidden messages
in everything from books, to pieces of toast, to the night sky, their real origin 
is usually our own minds.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options, it is the closest match in terms of question content and intent. Question 7 asks about the name of the mathematician who made a specific remark, and the correct answer is T.S. Motzkin. The ground truth MCQ asks about the statement made by T.S. Motzkin (note: the name is misspelled as "Mazkin" in the ground truth MCQ) and provides options that include the correct statement. 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 7, but I would also suggest generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and content.

**Transcript**:
Let's say you're on a game show. You've already earned $1000 
in the first round when you land on the bonus space. Now, you have a choice. You can either take 
a $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin. If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus. If it's tails, you get no bonus at all. In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space. Now you have another choice. You can either take a $500 loss, or try your luck at the coin flip. If it's heads, you lose nothing, but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead. If you're like most people, you probably chose to take
the guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round. But if you think about it,
this makes no sense. The odds and outcomes in both rounds
are exactly the same. So why does the second round
seem much scarier? The answer lies in a phenomenon
known as loss aversion. Under rational economic theory, our decisions should follow a simple
mathematical equation that weighs the level of risk
against the amount at stake. But studies have found 
that for many people, the negative psychological impact
we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing. Loss aversion is one cognitive bias
that arises from heuristics, problem-solving approaches based on
previous experience and intuition rather than careful analysis. And these mental shortcuts can lead
to irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily
be proven wrong. Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics. For instance, say you were to roll a die
with four green faces and two red faces twenty times. You can choose one of 
the following sequences of rolls, and if it shows up, 
you'll win $25. Which would you pick? In one study, 65% of the participants
who were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter
and contained within B, in other words, more likely. This is what's called 
a conjunction fallacy. Here, we expect to see more green rolls, so our brains can trick us into picking
the less likely option. Heuristics are also terrible 
at dealing with numbers in general. In one example, students were split
into two groups. The first group was asked whether
Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140. Both numbers were obviously way off, but when the students were then asked
to guess the actual age at which he died, the first group's answers averaged to 50 while the second group's averaged to 67. Even though the clearly wrong information
in the initial questions should have been irrelevant, it still affected the students' estimates. This is an example 
of the anchoring effect, and it's often used in marketing
and negotiations to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay. So, if heuristics lead to 
all these wrong decisions, why do we even have them? Well, because they can be quite effective. For most of human history, survival depended on making quick
decisions with limited information. When there's no time to logically
analyze all the possibilities, heuristics can sometimes save our lives. But today's environment requires
far more complex decision-making, and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think, affecting everything from health 
and education to finance and criminal justice. We can't just shut off 
our brain's heuristics, but we can learn to be aware of them. When you come to 
a situation involving numbers, probability, or multiple details, pause for a second and consider that the intuitive answer
might not be the right one after all.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the closest match, as it deals with cognitive biases and decision-making, which is related to the topic of rational economic theory.

But since the options and the question itself do not match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but with a very low confidence level.

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the bias of people's choices, it does ask about the typical ratio of the negative psychological impact of losing something to the positive impact of gaining the same thing, which is closely related to the concept of loss aversion and the idea that people's choices are biased by the stronger negative psychological impact of losing.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the bias of people's choices. Since such a question is not available, Question 2 is the closest match.

A better match would be a generated MCQ with the following content:
Question: According to loss aversion, what is the relationship between the negative psychological impact of losing something and the positive psychological impact of gaining the same thing?
Options: A. The negative impact is weaker, B. The negative impact is stronger, C. The negative impact is equal, D. The negative impact is variable.

Unfortunately, this question is not among the generated MCQs, so Question 2 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Let's say you're on a game show. You've already earned $1000 
in the first round when you land on the bonus space. Now, you have a choice. You can either take 
a $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin. If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus. If it's tails, you get no bonus at all. In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space. Now you have another choice. You can either take a $500 loss, or try your luck at the coin flip. If it's heads, you lose nothing, but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead. If you're like most people, you probably chose to take
the guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round. But if you think about it,
this makes no sense. The odds and outcomes in both rounds
are exactly the same. So why does the second round
seem much scarier? The answer lies in a phenomenon
known as loss aversion. Under rational economic theory, our decisions should follow a simple
mathematical equation that weighs the level of risk
against the amount at stake. But studies have found 
that for many people, the negative psychological impact
we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing. Loss aversion is one cognitive bias
that arises from heuristics, problem-solving approaches based on
previous experience and intuition rather than careful analysis. And these mental shortcuts can lead
to irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily
be proven wrong. Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics. For instance, say you were to roll a die
with four green faces and two red faces twenty times. You can choose one of 
the following sequences of rolls, and if it shows up, 
you'll win $25. Which would you pick? In one study, 65% of the participants
who were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter
and contained within B, in other words, more likely. This is what's called 
a conjunction fallacy. Here, we expect to see more green rolls, so our brains can trick us into picking
the less likely option. Heuristics are also terrible 
at dealing with numbers in general. In one example, students were split
into two groups. The first group was asked whether
Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140. Both numbers were obviously way off, but when the students were then asked
to guess the actual age at which he died, the first group's answers averaged to 50 while the second group's averaged to 67. Even though the clearly wrong information
in the initial questions should have been irrelevant, it still affected the students' estimates. This is an example 
of the anchoring effect, and it's often used in marketing
and negotiations to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay. So, if heuristics lead to 
all these wrong decisions, why do we even have them? Well, because they can be quite effective. For most of human history, survival depended on making quick
decisions with limited information. When there's no time to logically
analyze all the possibilities, heuristics can sometimes save our lives. But today's environment requires
far more complex decision-making, and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think, affecting everything from health 
and education to finance and criminal justice. We can't just shut off 
our brain's heuristics, but we can learn to be aware of them. When you come to 
a situation involving numbers, probability, or multiple details, pause for a second and consider that the intuitive answer
might not be the right one after all.

Albert Einstein. The icon of genius. Why? Because he figured out E equals m c squared? Because he didn't like socks? Nope! Because he came up with the most powerful idea in science.. General Relativity His masterpiece is now 100 years old. And while the physicists are partying, the rest of us are left wondering what the BLEEP it’s all about! Well here goes. At 26 he figured out nothing less than a new theory of space and time. It led to a nifty way of simplifying physics – by treating space and time as one thing... Spacetime! But Albert was just warming up. He wasn’t happy with Isaac Newton’s mysterious force of gravity. Naturally, he started work on his own theory. And sure enough, he cracked it. Mass causes spacetime to curve! The natural motion of things is to follow the simplest path through spacetime. But since objects with mass curve spacetime, stuff moves towards the most massive objects. That’s what you feel as gravity. It’s warped space and time that’s keeping your feet on the ground. “Warped space” might sound too sci-fi to be true. But we can measure the bending of starlight as is passes through the warped space around the sun. Warped time sounds even more ridiculous. But take an accurate clock to the top of a building and you’ll see it runs slightly quicker than one on the ground! That’s because as you move away from the centre of the planet space and time are less warped. Most amazing of all, Einstein’s theory told us that our universe has a beginning. Everything is expanding out from a hot dense origin 13.8 billion years ago. But here’s the catch: We’ve spotted that the universe is expanding faster than Albert’s theory predicts. Could the old genius be wrong? To stick with his idea we’ve had to invent a made up energy - ‘dark energy’ - to account for the speedy expansion. And we’ve had to assume there’s an exotic form of ‘dark matter' we haven’t detected yet either. These two unknowns should make up 95% of the universe – yet we’ve never detected them. That’s the sort of thing that keeps physicists awake at night. So they’re plotting some seriously big experiments to put Albert’s theory to the ultimate test. For the last 100 years, uncle Albert’s great theory has passed every test possible. If it succeeds again physicists will party. If they find its limits and it finally fails they’ll party too. Physicists are funny like that.

But since objects with mass curve spacetime, stuff moves towards the most massive objects. That’s what you feel as gravity. It’s warped space and time that’s keeping your feet on the ground. “Warped space” might sound too sci-fi to be true. But we can measure the bending of starlight as is passes through the warped space around the sun. Warped time sounds even more ridiculous. But take an accurate clock to the top of a building and you’ll see it runs slightly quicker than one on the ground! That’s because as you move away from the centre of the planet space and time are less warped. Most amazing of all, Einstein’s theory told us that our universe has a beginning. Everything is expanding out from a hot dense origin 13.8 billion years ago. But here’s the catch: We’ve spotted that the universe is expanding faster than Albert’s theory predicts. Could the old genius be wrong? To stick with his idea we’ve had to invent a made up energy - ‘dark energy’ - to account for the speedy expansion. And we’ve had to assume there’s an exotic form of ‘dark matter' we haven’t detected yet either. These two unknowns should make up 95% of the universe – yet we’ve never detected them. That’s the sort of thing that keeps physicists awake at night. So they’re plotting some seriously big experiments to put Albert’s theory to the ultimate test. For the last 100 years, uncle Albert’s great theory has passed every test possible. If it succeeds again physicists will party. If they find its limits and it finally fails they’ll party too. Physicists are funny like that.

In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits. Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states
for two possible values, 0 and 1. Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits, all processed in 
the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face 
a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed. Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks, and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage. When you run a program, your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key
in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them,
or create new ones. The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging
to retain data. But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered. For data to remain
once the device is turned off, it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap
and removable, they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges within their specially designed 
internal structures. So how reliable 
are these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device
and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates. Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.

the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face 
a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed. Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks, and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage. When you run a program, your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key
in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them,
or create new ones. The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging
to retain data. But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered. For data to remain
once the device is turned off, it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap
and removable, they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges within their specially designed 
internal structures. So how reliable 
are these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device
and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates. Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 5 does not match the ground truth MCQ's options and is not about the fundamental memory element in flash memory, I re-examined the generated MCQs.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ's intent, options, and content. But if I had to choose the closest one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3, because it talks about memory types, but it's not about flash memory specifically.

 Nevertheless, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is the closest, but I want to emphasize that it's not a good match.

 Index: 5 (but not a good match)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Your cell phone is mainly made
of plastics and metals. It's easy to appreciate 
the inventive process by which those elements are made to add up
to something so useful and entertaining. But there's another story 
we don't hear about as much. How did we get our raw ingredients
in the first place from the chaotic tangle of materials
that is nature? The answer is a group of clever hacks
known as separation techniques. They work by taking advantage
of the fundamental properties of things to disentangle them from each other. Simple separation techniques
apply to many physical scenarios, like separating cream from milk, extracting water from soil, or even sifting out flecks of gold
from river sand. But not all mixtures 
are so easy to unravel. In some of those cases, we can exploit the differences between
physical properties within a mixture, like particle size, density, or boiling point to extract what's required. Take petroleum, a mixture of different 
types of hydrocarbons. Some of these are valuable as fuels, and others make good raw materials
for generating electric power. To separate them, experts rely on one
important feature: different hydrocarbons boil 
at different temperatures. During the boiling process,
each type vaporizes at a precise point, then gets separately funneled 
into a container and collected as a liquid as it cools. Separation techniques 
also take us to the sea. In some drought-stricken countries, the ocean is the only 
available water source. But of course,
humans can't drink salt water. One way to get around this problem is to remove salt from sea water 
with reverse osmosis, a process that separates 
water's ingredients by size. A membrane with pores 
bigger than water particles, but smaller than salt particles, only lets fresh water pass through, transforming what was once undrinkable
into a life saver. Meanwhile in the medical world, blood tests are a vital tool 
for evaluating a person's health, but doctors typically 
can't examine blood samples until they've separated 
the solid blood cells from the liquid plasma 
they're dissolved in. To do that, a powerful rotational force
is exerted on the test tube, causing heavier substances 
with higher density, like blood cells, to move away from the rotational axis. Meanwhile, lighter substances 
with lower density, like plasma, move to its center. The tube's contents divide clearly, and the blood cells and liquid plasma
can be tested independently. But sometimes, unlike oil,
seawater, and blood, the parts of mixtures 
that we want to separate share the same physical properties. In these cases, the only way to isolate 
ingredients is by chemical separation, a complex process that relies 
on unique interactions between components within a mixture
and another material. One of these methods is chromatography, a tool forensic scientists use 
to examine crime scenes. They dissolve gathered evidence in a gas, and can monitor 
and analyze the ingredients as they separate 
and move at varying speeds due to their unique chemical properties. That information then tells scientists
precisely what was present at the scene, often helping to identify the culprit. Separation techniques are not just about
industry, infrastructure, medicine, and justice. One of the most technically ambitious
projects in human history is a separation technique aimed at
answering the fundamental question, "What is the Universe made of?" By accelerating particles 
to extremely high speeds and smashing them into each other, we can break them into 
their constituent parts ever so briefly. And if we succeed at that, what's next? Is there a most elementary particle? And if so, what's it made of?

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Your cell phone is mainly made
of plastics and metals. It's easy to appreciate 
the inventive process by which those elements are made to add up
to something so useful and entertaining. But there's another story 
we don't hear about as much. How did we get our raw ingredients
in the first place from the chaotic tangle of materials
that is nature? The answer is a group of clever hacks
known as separation techniques. They work by taking advantage
of the fundamental properties of things to disentangle them from each other. Simple separation techniques
apply to many physical scenarios, like separating cream from milk, extracting water from soil, or even sifting out flecks of gold
from river sand. But not all mixtures 
are so easy to unravel. In some of those cases, we can exploit the differences between
physical properties within a mixture, like particle size, density, or boiling point to extract what's required. Take petroleum, a mixture of different 
types of hydrocarbons. Some of these are valuable as fuels, and others make good raw materials
for generating electric power. To separate them, experts rely on one
important feature: different hydrocarbons boil 
at different temperatures. During the boiling process,
each type vaporizes at a precise point, then gets separately funneled 
into a container and collected as a liquid as it cools. Separation techniques 
also take us to the sea. In some drought-stricken countries, the ocean is the only 
available water source. But of course,
humans can't drink salt water. One way to get around this problem is to remove salt from sea water 
with reverse osmosis, a process that separates 
water's ingredients by size. A membrane with pores 
bigger than water particles, but smaller than salt particles, only lets fresh water pass through, transforming what was once undrinkable
into a life saver. Meanwhile in the medical world, blood tests are a vital tool 
for evaluating a person's health, but doctors typically 
can't examine blood samples until they've separated 
the solid blood cells from the liquid plasma 
they're dissolved in. To do that, a powerful rotational force
is exerted on the test tube, causing heavier substances 
with higher density, like blood cells, to move away from the rotational axis. Meanwhile, lighter substances 
with lower density, like plasma, move to its center. The tube's contents divide clearly, and the blood cells and liquid plasma
can be tested independently. But sometimes, unlike oil,
seawater, and blood, the parts of mixtures 
that we want to separate share the same physical properties. In these cases, the only way to isolate 
ingredients is by chemical separation, a complex process that relies 
on unique interactions between components within a mixture
and another material. One of these methods is chromatography, a tool forensic scientists use 
to examine crime scenes. They dissolve gathered evidence in a gas, and can monitor 
and analyze the ingredients as they separate 
and move at varying speeds due to their unique chemical properties. That information then tells scientists
precisely what was present at the scene, often helping to identify the culprit. Separation techniques are not just about
industry, infrastructure, medicine, and justice. One of the most technically ambitious
projects in human history is a separation technique aimed at
answering the fundamental question, "What is the Universe made of?" By accelerating particles 
to extremely high speeds and smashing them into each other, we can break them into 
their constituent parts ever so briefly. And if we succeed at that, what's next? Is there a most elementary particle? And if so, what's it made of?

**Transcript**:
Massive vines that blanket
the southern United States, climbing as high as 100 feet as they
uproot trees and swallow buildings. A ravenous snake that is capable of
devouring an alligator. Rabbit populations that eat
themselves into starvation. These aren't horror movie concepts. They're real stories, but how could such situations
exist in nature? All three are examples
of invasive species, organisms harmful not because
of what they are, but where they happen to be. The kudzu vine, for example, had grown quality in its native east Asia,
eaten by various insects and dying off during the cold winters. But its fortunes changed when it was imported 
into the southeastern United States for porch decoration and cattle feed. Its planting was even subsidized
by the government to fight soil erosion. With sunny fields, a mild climate,
and no natural predators in its new home, the vine grew uncontrollably until it became known as the plant
that ate the South. Meanwhile in Florida's Everglades,
Burmese pythons, thought to have been released
by pet owners, are the cause of decreasing populations
of organisms. They're successfully outcompeting
top predators, such as the alligator and panther, causing a significant reduction
in their food sources. They're not a problem
in their native Asia because diseases, parasites, and predators
help to control their population size. And in Australia, European rabbits
eat so many plants that they wipe out the food supply
for themselves and other herbivores. They're a pretty recent addition, intentionally introduced to the continent
because one man enjoyed hunting them. Like the Burmese pythons, various factors in their native habitat
keep their numbers in control. But in Australia, the lack of predators and a climate perfect 
for year-long reproduction allows their populations to skyrocket. So why does this keep happening? Most of the world's ecosystems are the result of millennia 
of coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment 
and each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance
via limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict
the size or range of a species. These include things 
like natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends
on levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects
the population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores
that feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps
the herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor
can upset this balance, and the sudden introduction
of non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved
in a separate habitat will be susceptible to different 
limiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat's limiting factors
fail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms
for resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem. Species are sometimes introduced
into new habitats through natural factors, like storms, ocean currents, or climate shifts. The majority of invasive species,
though, are introduced by humans. Often this happens unintentionally, as when the zebra mussel was accidentally
brought to Lake Erie by cargo ships. But as people migrate around the world, we have also deliberately brought
our plants and animals along, rarely considering the consequences. But now that we're learning more about the effects of invasive species
on ecosystems, many governments closely monitor
the transport of plants and animals, and ban the imports of certain organisms. But could the species with
the most drastic environmental impact be a group of primates who emerged
from Africa to cover most of the world? Are we an invasive species?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. Question 5 asks about the primary reason why European rabbits are able to thrive in Australia, and one of the options (B) mentions that they have no natural predators in Australia. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the main problems caused by the Burmese python and European rabbit, and the correct answer is that they compete with native species for food. The lack of natural predators is a key factor in why these invasive species are able to outcompete native species for resources.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 5 is the closest but still not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication
as an exchange of information, then plants seem to be 
active communicators. They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not directly ask about the availability of information in plant cues, it does relate to how plants communicate through airborne chemicals. However, a more relevant question would be one that asks about how plants receive and respond to cues.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the recipients of plant cues. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 4 is the closest match, as it deals with the similarity of chemical fingerprints, which can influence how effectively plants can communicate with each other.

**Transcript**:
Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication
as an exchange of information, then plants seem to be 
active communicators. They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,
or the Internet. And if we can learn to speak to them
on their terms, we may gain a powerful new tool to protect
crops and other valuable species. It all makes you wonder 
what else are we missing?

If you visit a museum with a collection
of modern and contemporary art, you're likely to see works that sometimes
elicit the response, "My cat could make that,
so how is it art?" A movement called Abstract Expressionism,
also known as the New York School, gets this reaction particularly often. Abstract Expressionism started in 1943 and developed after the end of
World War II. It's characterized by large,
primarily abstract paintings, all-over compositions 
without clear focal points, and sweeping swaths of paint
embodying and eliciting emotions. The group of artists who are considered
Abstract Expressionists includes Barnett Newman 
with his existential zips, Willem de Kooning, famous 
for his travestied women, Helen Frankenthaler, 
who created soak-stains, and others. But perhaps the most famous, influential,
and head-scratching one was Jackson Pollock. Most of his paintings 
are immediately recognizable. They feature tangled messes
of lines of paint bouncing around in every direction
on the canvas. And sure, these fields of chaos are big
and impressive, but what's so great about them? Didn't he just drip the paint at random? Can't anyone do that? Well, the answer to these questions
is both yes and no. While Pollock implemented a technique
anyone is technically capable of regardless of artistic training, only he could have made his paintings. This paradox relates to his work's roots in the Surrealist automatic drawings
of André Masson and others. These Surrealists supposedly drew
directly from the unconscious to reveal truths hidden 
within their minds. Occasionally, instead of picturing 
something and then drawing it, they let their hands move automatically and would later tease out familiar figures
that appeared in the scribbles. And after Pollock moved away 
from representation, he made drip, or action, paintings
following a similar premise, though he developed a signature technique and never looked for images or messages
hidden in the works. First, he took the canvas off of the easel
and laid it on the floor, a subversive act in itself. Then, in a controlled dance, he stepped
all around the canvas, dripping industrial paint onto it
from stirrers and other tools, changing speed and direction to control how the paint 
made contact with the surface. These movements, 
like the Surrealist scribbles, were supposedly born 
out of Pollock's subconscious. But unlike the Surrealists, whose pictures represented 
the mind's hidden contents, Pollock's supposedly made physical
manifestations of his psyche. His paintings are themselves
signatures of his mind. In theory, anyone could make a painting
that is an imprint of their mind. So why is Pollock so special? Well, it's important to remember that
while anyone could have done what he did, he and the rest of the New York School
were the ones who actually did it. They destroyed conventions of painting
that had stood for centuries, forcing the art world to rethink
them entirely. But one last reason why Jackson Pollock's
work has stayed prominent stems from the specific objects he made,
which embody fascinating contradictions. For instance, while Pollock's process resulted in radically flat 
painted surfaces, the web of painted lines can create
the illusion of an infinite layered depth when examined up close. And the chaos of this tangled mess seems
to defy all control, but it's actually the product
of a deliberate, though not pre-planned, process. These characteristics made Pollock
into a celebrity, and within art history, they also elevated him 
to the mythified status of the genius artist as hero. So rather than evening the playing field
for all creative minds, his work unfortunately reinforced
a long-standing elitist aspect of art. Elitist, innovative, whatever you choose to call it, the history embedded 
in Abstract Expressionism is one that no cat, however talented,
can claim.

**Transcript**:
If you visit a museum with a collection
of modern and contemporary art, you're likely to see works that sometimes
elicit the response, "My cat could make that,
so how is it art?" A movement called Abstract Expressionism,
also known as the New York School, gets this reaction particularly often. Abstract Expressionism started in 1943 and developed after the end of
World War II. It's characterized by large,
primarily abstract paintings, all-over compositions 
without clear focal points, and sweeping swaths of paint
embodying and eliciting emotions. The group of artists who are considered
Abstract Expressionists includes Barnett Newman 
with his existential zips, Willem de Kooning, famous 
for his travestied women, Helen Frankenthaler, 
who created soak-stains, and others. But perhaps the most famous, influential,
and head-scratching one was Jackson Pollock. Most of his paintings 
are immediately recognizable. They feature tangled messes
of lines of paint bouncing around in every direction
on the canvas. And sure, these fields of chaos are big
and impressive, but what's so great about them? Didn't he just drip the paint at random? Can't anyone do that? Well, the answer to these questions
is both yes and no. While Pollock implemented a technique
anyone is technically capable of regardless of artistic training, only he could have made his paintings. This paradox relates to his work's roots in the Surrealist automatic drawings
of André Masson and others. These Surrealists supposedly drew
directly from the unconscious to reveal truths hidden 
within their minds. Occasionally, instead of picturing 
something and then drawing it, they let their hands move automatically and would later tease out familiar figures
that appeared in the scribbles. And after Pollock moved away 
from representation, he made drip, or action, paintings
following a similar premise, though he developed a signature technique and never looked for images or messages
hidden in the works. First, he took the canvas off of the easel
and laid it on the floor, a subversive act in itself. Then, in a controlled dance, he stepped
all around the canvas, dripping industrial paint onto it
from stirrers and other tools, changing speed and direction to control how the paint 
made contact with the surface. These movements, 
like the Surrealist scribbles, were supposedly born 
out of Pollock's subconscious. But unlike the Surrealists, whose pictures represented 
the mind's hidden contents, Pollock's supposedly made physical
manifestations of his psyche. His paintings are themselves
signatures of his mind. In theory, anyone could make a painting
that is an imprint of their mind. So why is Pollock so special? Well, it's important to remember that
while anyone could have done what he did, he and the rest of the New York School
were the ones who actually did it. They destroyed conventions of painting
that had stood for centuries, forcing the art world to rethink
them entirely. But one last reason why Jackson Pollock's
work has stayed prominent stems from the specific objects he made,
which embody fascinating contradictions. For instance, while Pollock's process resulted in radically flat 
painted surfaces, the web of painted lines can create
the illusion of an infinite layered depth when examined up close. And the chaos of this tangled mess seems
to defy all control, but it's actually the product
of a deliberate, though not pre-planned, process. These characteristics made Pollock
into a celebrity, and within art history, they also elevated him 
to the mythified status of the genius artist as hero. So rather than evening the playing field
for all creative minds, his work unfortunately reinforced
a long-standing elitist aspect of art. Elitist, innovative, whatever you choose to call it, the history embedded 
in Abstract Expressionism is one that no cat, however talented,
can claim.

**Transcript**:
Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about scaling the silicon sphere to the size of the Earth and comparing the height difference between the highest mountain and the lowest valley. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs have this exact question intent.

However, I can suggest that Question 1 is the most similar in terms of theme and content, as it discusses the silicon sphere, but it does not match the question intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 1 is the closest, but still not a good match.

Index: 1 (but not a good match)

Note: I would recommend generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: Why was the original name "grave" for the base unit of mass changed?**

Although the options and the exact question wording do not match, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions deal with the historical context and the reason behind a change in the definition or naming of the kilogram.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the kilogram being the only SI measurement with a prefix, which is not directly addressed by any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it's not a perfect match.

with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the equivalent measurement of the divergence of the "kilogram of the archives" from its original measurement, while Question 5 asks about the problem with the current definition of the kilogram. Although not identical, Question 5's correct answer "It is not stable over time" is related to the issue of the kilogram's mass diverging over time, which is the context of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

5

Please keep in mind that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs may need to be revised to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And

changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: Why was the original name "grave" for the base unit of mass changed?**

Although the options and the exact question wording do not match, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions deal with the historical context and the reason behind a change in the definition or naming of the kilogram.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the kilogram being the only SI measurement with a prefix, which is not directly addressed by any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it's not a perfect match.

Index: 2

**Transcript**:
Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this

the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the equivalent measurement of the divergence of the "kilogram of the archives" from its original measurement, while Question 5 asks about the problem with the current definition of the kilogram. Although not identical, Question 5's correct answer "It is not stable over time" is related to the issue of the kilogram's mass diverging over time, which is the context of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

5

Please keep in mind that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs may need to be revised to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

Why do cats do that? They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,
"Why do cats do that?" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure
and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points
to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity
to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by 
the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of
her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else 
you put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert 
at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything 
we do know about cats, it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators 
that hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid
and escaped to survive. So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able
to outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey.

in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything 
we do know about cats, it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators 
that hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid
and escaped to survive. So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able

**Transcript**:
Why do cats do that? They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,
"Why do cats do that?" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure
and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points
to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity
to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by 
the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of
her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else 
you put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert 
at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything

**Transcript**:
Somewhere right now,
people are lining up to scare themselves, maybe with a thrill ride or horror movie. In fact, in October of 2015 alone, about 28 million people visited
a haunted house in the U.S. But many consider 
this behavior perplexing, asking the question, "What could possibly be fun 
about being scared?" Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad. For starters, 
fear can actually feel pretty good. When a threat triggers 
our fight or flight response, our bodies prepare for danger by releasing chemicals that change
how our brains and bodies function. This automatic response jumpstarts
systems that can aid in survival. They do this by making sure
we have enough energy and are protected from feeling pain, while shutting down nonessential systems,
like critical thought. Feeling pain-free and energized, while not getting caught up in worrisome 
thoughts that normally occupy our brains, that all sounds great, and it can be because this response
is similar, though not exactly the same to what we experience in positive,
high-arousal states, like excitement, happiness,
and even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused
on survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal 
response in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying
the natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go
from screaming to laughing within moments. Your body is already in a euphoric state. You're just relabeling the experience. And though the threat response 
is universal, research shows differences 
between individuals in how the chemicals associated
with the threat response work. This explains why some are more prone
to thrill-seeking than others. Other normal physical differences explain why some may love the dizziness
associated with a loop-de-loop, while loathing the stomach-drop sensation
of a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight
inside a haunted house, but retreat in terror 
if taken to an actual cemetery. Fear brings more 
than just a fun, natural high. Doing things that we're afraid of
can give us a nice boost of self-esteem. Like any personal challenge, whether it's running a race
or finishing a long book, when we make it through to the end, we feel a sense of accomplishment. This is true even if we know 
we're not really in any danger. Our thinking brains may know 
the zombies aren't real, but our bodies tell us otherwise. The fear feels real, so when we make it through alive, the satisfaction and sense 
of accomplishment also feel real. This is a great evolutionary adaptation. Those who had the right balance 
of bravery and wit to know when to push through the fear
and when to retreat were rewarded with survival, new food, and new lands. Finally, fear can bring people together. Emotions can be contagious, and when you see your friend
scream and laugh, you feel compelled to do the same. This is because we make sense of what
our friends are experiencing by recreating the experience ourselves. In fact, the parts of the brain
that are active when our friend screams are active in us when we watch them. This not only intensifies 
our own emotional experience, but makes us feel closer 
to those we're with. The feeling of closeness during
times of fear is aided by the hormone oxytocin
released during fight or flight. Fear is a powerful emotional experience, and anything 
that triggers a strong reaction is going to be stored in our memory
really well. You don't want to forget 
what can hurt you. So if your memory of watching a horror
film with your friends is positive and left you with a sense of satisfaction, then you'll want to do it over
and over again.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Question 2 asks about the primary function of the fight or flight response, and one of the options (B) mentions preparing the body for danger by releasing chemicals that aid in survival. The ground truth MCQ asks about what the body prioritizes during fight or flight, and the correct answer is that it does not prioritize critical or cognitive functioning. 

However, if I had to choose a question that is most similar in terms of the specific aspect of fight or flight mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (i.e., what the body prioritizes during this response), I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest.

But upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 3, Question 4, and Question 6 discuss the fight or flight response but not what the body prioritizes during it. Question 5 and Question 7 to Question 10 discuss the effects or benefits of fear but not the fight or flight response itself.

However, I noticed that Question 2 discusses the primary function of the fight or flight response, which includes releasing chemicals to aid in survival, and it is the closest to discussing what the body prioritizes during this response.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and it would be best to generate new MCQs that more closely match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one of the provided generated MCQs, I would say that Question 2 is the closest.

of a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight
inside a haunted house, but retreat in terror 
if taken to an actual cemetery. Fear brings more 
than just a fun, natural high. Doing things that we're afraid of
can give us a nice boost of self-esteem. Like any personal challenge, whether it's running a race
or finishing a long book, when we make it through to the end, we feel a sense of accomplishment. This is true even if we know 
we're not really in any danger. Our thinking brains may know 
the zombies aren't real, but our bodies tell us otherwise. The fear feels real, so when we make it through alive, the satisfaction and sense 
of accomplishment also feel real. This is a great evolutionary adaptation. Those who had the right balance 
of bravery and wit to know when to push through the fear
and when to retreat were rewarded with survival, new food, and new lands. Finally, fear can bring people together. Emotions can be contagious, and when you see your friend
scream and laugh, you feel compelled to do the same. This is because we make sense of what
our friends are experiencing by recreating the experience ourselves. In fact, the parts of the brain
that are active when our friend screams are active in us when we watch them. This not only intensifies 
our own emotional experience, but makes us feel closer 
to those we're with. The feeling of closeness during
times of fear is aided by the hormone oxytocin
released during fight or flight. Fear is a powerful emotional experience, and anything 
that triggers a strong reaction is going to be stored in our memory
really well. You don't want to forget 
what can hurt you. So if your memory of watching a horror
film with your friends is positive and left you with a sense of satisfaction, then you'll want to do it over
and over again.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere right now,
people are lining up to scare themselves, maybe with a thrill ride or horror movie. In fact, in October of 2015 alone, about 28 million people visited
a haunted house in the U.S. But many consider 
this behavior perplexing, asking the question, "What could possibly be fun 
about being scared?" Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad. For starters, 
fear can actually feel pretty good. When a threat triggers 
our fight or flight response, our bodies prepare for danger by releasing chemicals that change
how our brains and bodies function. This automatic response jumpstarts
systems that can aid in survival. They do this by making sure
we have enough energy and are protected from feeling pain, while shutting down nonessential systems,
like critical thought. Feeling pain-free and energized, while not getting caught up in worrisome 
thoughts that normally occupy our brains, that all sounds great, and it can be because this response
is similar, though not exactly the same to what we experience in positive,
high-arousal states, like excitement, happiness,
and even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused
on survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal 
response in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying
the natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go
from screaming to laughing within moments. Your body is already in a euphoric state. You're just relabeling the experience. And though the threat response 
is universal, research shows differences 
between individuals in how the chemicals associated
with the threat response work. This explains why some are more prone
to thrill-seeking than others. Other normal physical differences explain why some may love the dizziness
associated with a loop-de-loop, while loathing the stomach-drop sensation
of a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight

Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You've heard people say, "It's just like riding a bike" meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right? But I did something. I did something that damaged my mind. It happened on the streets of Amsterdam and I got really scared honestly. I can't ride a bike like you can anymore. Before I show you the video of what happened I need to tell you the back story. Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young. I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it. Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later. Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers. He had a challenge for me. He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it. He had only changed one thing. When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right. When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left. I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this. - And here he is ladies and gentlemen, Mr Destin Sandlin. First attempt riding the bicycle. - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't do it. You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated. In this moment I had a really deep revelation. My thinking was in a rut. This bike revealed a very deep truth to me. I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding. Therefore, knowledge is not understanding. Look I know what you're probably thinking. Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it. But that's not the case at all. The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike, in your brain, is just that complicated. Think about it. Downwards force on the pedals, leaning your whole body, pulling and pushing the handlebars, gyroscopic procession in the wheels, every single force is part of this algorithm. And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system. I do not make definitive statements that often, but I'm telling you right now, you cannot ride this bicycle. You might think you can, but you can't. I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences and I take the bike with me. It's always the same. People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it. It doesn't work. Your brain cannot handle this. For instance, this guy. I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage. Everybody thought he could do it. [crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand. So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs] Alright so, whenever you're ready. Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs] [laughing crowd] You've gotta start rolling at least. And go. Keep your feet on the pedal, go. [laughing crowd] Just keep your feet on the pedals. Alright, one more time. Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head, sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to. So here's what I did. It was a personal challenge. I stayed out here in this driveway and I practiced about 5 minutes every day. My neighbors made fun of me. I had many wrecks. But after 8 months, this happened. One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could. It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked. It was really weird though. It's like there's this trail in my brain, but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it, my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with. Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket, would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck. But at least I could ride it. My son is the closest person to me genetically and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years, that's over half his life. I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut. Are you gonna give up? - No. - Go ahead. This is how it starts. Look at this. This is such a big deal. Get up, you got it. Did you see his brain get it? So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks? In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do, which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity, am I even saying that right? Than an adult. It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults. That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child. Alright, today's bike log. I can ride smooth, I can ride fast. I'm thinking the experiment is over. OK now I'm in Amsterdam, a city that has more bicycles than people. The question is, can I ride a normal bike now. I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike, If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up. So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will. And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike. It's backwards, it's backwards. This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life. I had ridden a normal bike since I was six, but in this moment I couldn't do it any more. I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias, but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias. So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here, looking at me. Looking at the strange American, that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb. But I'm actually two levels deep into this, because I've learned and un-learned. Alright. After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself, suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm. I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment. [laughter] I've got it, I've got it, I've got it. I'm back. Oh it clicked. It clicked. I've got it, I've got it. OK there it is. There was the moment. OK I can ride a bike. I tried to explain this to the people around me, and they just didn't get it. They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes and I couldn't get anybody to believe me. That looked like I faked it, didn't it. You think I'm faking. You don't believe me. - It looked so weird... - You think I'm lying don't you. I'm not lying. I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike, and I couldn't articulate it to anyone because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike. So I learned 3 things from this experiment. I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers, I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding, and I learned that truth is truth. No matter what I think about it. So be very careful how you interpret things because you're looking at the world with a bias whether you think you are or not. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What does the experiment demonstrate about children's brains compared to adults'? 

However, the options provided for this question do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly compares the learning abilities of Destin and his son.

A more suitable match would be Question 5: What was the result when Destin's son tried to learn how to ride the reversed bike? Options: A. He took longer than Destin to master it, B. He took the same amount of time as Destin to master it, C. He mastered it in 2 weeks, much faster than Destin, D. He refused to try 

This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ because it directly compares the learning abilities of Destin and his son, and it implies that the reason for the difference in learning time is due to age.

However, an even more suitable match would be a question that explicitly asks why Destin's son was able to learn to ride the reversed bike faster than Destin.

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You've heard people say, "It's just like riding a bike" meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right? But I did something. I did something that damaged my mind. It happened on the streets of Amsterdam and I got really scared honestly. I can't ride a bike like you can anymore. Before I show you the video of what happened I need to tell you the back story. Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young. I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it. Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later. Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers. He had a challenge for me. He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it. He had only changed one thing. When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right. When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left. I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this. - And here he is ladies and gentlemen, Mr Destin Sandlin. First attempt riding the bicycle. - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't do it. You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated. In this moment I had a really deep revelation. My thinking was in a rut. This bike revealed a very deep truth to me. I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding. Therefore, knowledge is not understanding. Look I know what you're probably thinking. Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it. But that's not the case at all. The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike, in your brain, is just that complicated. Think about it. Downwards force on the pedals, leaning your whole body, pulling and pushing the handlebars, gyroscopic procession in the wheels, every single force is part of this algorithm. And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system. I do not make definitive statements that often, but I'm telling you right now, you cannot ride this bicycle. You might think you can, but you can't. I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences and I take the bike with me. It's always the same. People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it. It doesn't work. Your brain cannot handle this. For instance, this guy.

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You've heard people say, "It's just like riding a bike" meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right? But I did something. I did something that damaged my mind. It happened on the streets of Amsterdam and I got really scared honestly. I can't ride a bike like you can anymore. Before I show you the video of what happened I need to tell you the back story. Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young. I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it. Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later. Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers. He had a challenge for me. He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it. He had only changed one thing. When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right. When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left. I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this. - And here he is ladies and gentlemen, Mr Destin Sandlin. First attempt riding the bicycle. - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't do it. You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated. In this moment I had a really deep revelation. My thinking was in a rut. This bike revealed a very deep truth to me. I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding. Therefore, knowledge is not understanding. Look I know what you're probably thinking. Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it. But that's not the case at all. The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike, in your brain, is just that complicated. Think about it. Downwards force on the pedals, leaning your whole body, pulling and pushing the handlebars, gyroscopic procession in the wheels, every single force is part of this algorithm. And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system. I do not make definitive statements that often, but I'm telling you right now, you cannot ride this bicycle. You might think you can, but you can't. I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences and I take the bike with me. It's always the same. People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it. It doesn't work. Your brain cannot handle this. For instance, this guy. I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage. Everybody thought he could do it. [crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand. So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs] Alright so, whenever you're ready. Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs] [laughing crowd] You've gotta start rolling at least. And go. Keep your feet on the pedal, go. [laughing crowd] Just keep your feet on the pedals. Alright, one more time. Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head, sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to. So here's what I did. It was a personal challenge. I stayed out here in this driveway and I practiced about 5 minutes every day. My neighbors made fun of me. I had many wrecks. But after 8 months, this happened. One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could. It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked. It was really weird though. It's like there's this trail in my brain, but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it, my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with. Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket, would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck. But at least I could ride it. My son is the closest person to me genetically and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years, that's over half his life. I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut. Are you gonna give up? - No. - Go ahead. This is how it starts. Look at this. This is such a big deal. Get up, you got it. Did you see his brain get it? So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks? In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do, which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity, am I even saying that right? Than an adult. It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults. That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child. Alright, today's bike log. I can ride smooth, I can ride fast. I'm thinking the experiment is over. OK now I'm in Amsterdam, a city that has more bicycles than people. The question is, can I ride a normal bike now. I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike, If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up. So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will. And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike. It's backwards, it's backwards. This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life. I had ridden a normal bike since I was six, but in this moment I couldn't do it any more. I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias, but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias. So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here, looking at me. Looking at the strange American, that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb. But I'm actually two levels deep into this, because I've learned and un-learned. Alright. After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself, suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm. I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment. [laughter] I've got it, I've got it, I've got it. I'm back. Oh it clicked. It clicked. I've got it, I've got it. OK there it is. There was the moment. OK I can ride a bike. I tried to explain this to the people around me, and they just didn't get it. They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes and I couldn't get anybody to believe me. That looked like I faked it, didn't it. You think I'm faking. You don't believe me. - It looked so weird... - You think I'm lying don't you. I'm not lying. I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike, and I couldn't articulate it to anyone because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike. So I learned 3 things from this experiment. I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers, I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding, and I learned that truth is truth. No matter what I think about it. So be very careful how you interpret things because you're looking at the world with a bias whether you think you are or not. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one. OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter I recommend Commander Hadfield's book which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I read it, it was awesome. If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle and my son did it as well, but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship. Not only that, but a different type of space station. He was on Mir and the International Space Station. Anyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day, audible.com/smarter, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. [crowd cheers] Everything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong. (Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it? - I can't ride it, I just build it. [laughs]

**Transcript**:
It starts with a tickle in your throat
that becomes a cough. Your muscles begin to ache, you grow irritable, and you lose your appetite. It's official: you've got the flu. It's logical to assume that this
miserable medley of symptoms is the result of the infection
coursing through your body, but is that really the case? What's actually making you feel sick? What if your body itself
was driving this vicious onslaught? You first get ill when a pathogen
like the flu virus gets into your system, infecting and killing your cells. But this unwelcome intrusion 
has another effect: it alerts your body's immune system
to your plight. As soon as it becomes aware of infection,
your body leaps to your defense. Cells called macrophages charge in
as the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses
and infected cells. Afterwards, the macrophages release
protein molecules called cytokines whose job is to recruit and organize more virus-busting cells 
from your immune system. If this coordinated effort 
is strong enough, it'll wipe out the infection
before you even notice it. But that's just your body setting
the scene for some real action. In some cases, viruses spread further, even into the blood and vital organs. To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate, your immune system must launch
a stronger attack, coordinating its activity with the brain. That's where those unpleasant symptoms
come in, starting with the surging temperature, aches and pains, and sleepiness. So why do we experience this? When the immune system is under
serious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses. First, the vagus nerve, which runs through
the body into the brain, quickly transmits the information
to the brain stem, passing near an important area
of pain processing. Second, cytokines travel through
the body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible
for controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things. When it receives this message, the hypothalamus produces
another molecule called prostaglandin E2,
which gears it up for war. The hypothalamus sends signals
that instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature. It also makes you sleepy, and you lose your appetite and thirst. But what's the point of all of these
unpleasant symptoms? Well, we're not yet sure, but some theorize that they aid
in recovery. The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system
destroy pathogens. Sleep lets your body channel
more energy towards fighting infection. When you stop eating, your liver can
take up much of the iron in your blood, and since iron is essential 
for bacterial survival, that effectively starves them. Your reduced thirst makes 
you mildly dehydrated, diminishing transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea. Though it's worth noting that if you don't
drink enough water, that dehydration can become dangerous. Even the body's aches 
make you more sensitive, drawing attention to infected cuts
that might be worsening, or even causing your condition. In addition to physical symptoms, sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused. That's because cytokines and prostaglandin can reach even higher structures 
in your brain, disrupting the activity 
of neurotransmitters, like glutamate, endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. This affects areas like the limbic system,
which oversees emotions, and your cerebral cortex,
which is involved in reasoning. So it's actually the body's own
immune response that causes much of the discomfort
you feel every time you get ill. Unfortunately, it doesn't always
work perfectly. Most notably, millions of people
worldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system treats
normal bodily cues as threats, so the body attacks itself. But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution
have fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, 
rather than against us. The symptoms of our illnesses 
are annoying, but collectively, 
they signify an ancient process that will continue barricading our bodies
against the outside world for centuries to come.

**Transcript**:
It starts with a tickle in your throat
that becomes a cough. Your muscles begin to ache, you grow irritable, and you lose your appetite. It's official: you've got the flu. It's logical to assume that this
miserable medley of symptoms is the result of the infection
coursing through your body, but is that really the case? What's actually making you feel sick? What if your body itself
was driving this vicious onslaught? You first get ill when a pathogen
like the flu virus gets into your system, infecting and killing your cells. But this unwelcome intrusion 
has another effect: it alerts your body's immune system
to your plight. As soon as it becomes aware of infection,
your body leaps to your defense. Cells called macrophages charge in
as the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses
and infected cells. Afterwards, the macrophages release
protein molecules called cytokines whose job is to recruit and organize more virus-busting cells 
from your immune system. If this coordinated effort 
is strong enough, it'll wipe out the infection
before you even notice it. But that's just your body setting
the scene for some real action. In some cases, viruses spread further, even into the blood and vital organs. To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate, your immune system must launch
a stronger attack, coordinating its activity with the brain. That's where those unpleasant symptoms
come in, starting with the surging temperature, aches and pains, and sleepiness. So why do we experience this? When the immune system is under
serious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses. First, the vagus nerve, which runs through
the body into the brain, quickly transmits the information
to the brain stem, passing near an important area
of pain processing. Second, cytokines travel through
the body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible
for controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things. When it receives this message, the hypothalamus produces
another molecule called prostaglandin E2,
which gears it up for war. The hypothalamus sends signals
that instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature. It also makes you sleepy, and you lose your appetite and thirst. But what's the point of all of these
unpleasant symptoms? Well, we're not yet sure, but some theorize that they aid
in recovery. The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system
destroy pathogens. Sleep lets your body channel
more energy towards fighting infection. When you stop eating, your liver can
take up much of the iron in your blood, and since iron is essential 
for bacterial survival, that effectively starves them. Your reduced thirst makes 
you mildly dehydrated, diminishing transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea. Though it's worth noting that if you don't
drink enough water, that dehydration can become dangerous. Even the body's aches 
make you more sensitive, drawing attention to infected cuts
that might be worsening, or even causing your condition. In addition to physical symptoms, sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused. That's because cytokines and prostaglandin can reach even higher structures 
in your brain, disrupting the activity 
of neurotransmitters, like glutamate, endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. This affects areas like the limbic system,
which oversees emotions, and your cerebral cortex,
which is involved in reasoning. So it's actually the body's own
immune response that causes much of the discomfort
you feel every time you get ill. Unfortunately, it doesn't always
work perfectly. Most notably, millions of people
worldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system treats
normal bodily cues as threats, so the body attacks itself. But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution
have fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, 
rather than against us. The symptoms of our illnesses 
are annoying, but collectively, 
they signify an ancient process that will continue barricading our bodies
against the outside world for centuries to come.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What is the role of cytokines in the immune response? Options: A. To destroy infected cells directly, B. To recruit and organize more virus-busting cells from the immune system, C. To transmit information to the brain stem, D. To produce prostaglandin E2**

Although the question itself does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, one of the options (C. To transmit information to the brain stem) closely relates to the ground truth MCQ's correct option (A. Activating the vagus nerve). The vagus nerve is mentioned in the transcript as transmitting information to the brain stem, which is a similar concept to option C in Question 2.

However, a closer match is found in:

**Question 5 is not the best match, but Question 3 and Question 4 aren't either.**

**The best match is actually Question 2's Option C or Question 5's lack of a direct relationship. However Question 5 does have some indirect info.**

**The best match is actually: Question 5 does have info about prostaglandin E2 and its effects but it is actually Question 2's Option C. Since it is more direct with cytokines it gets the edge over Question 5 but only due to the options of the other Generated questions.**

**Transcript**:
Just for a moment, focus on your breath. In slowly. Out slowly. In slowly. Out. The same pattern repeats within
every one of us and consider your pulse. The beat is built into the very
fabric of our being. Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm
and repetition. It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition, rhythm and repetition. On, and in, and on, and out. And we delight in those aspects everyday, in the rhythm of a song, the beat of the drum, the nod of your head, or in the repetition of soup cans, the rows of an orchard, the artistry of petals. Pattern can be pleasure. In language, rhythm and repetition
are often used as the building blocks for poetry. There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as, "So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see." And there's the repetition of language
at multiple levels: the repetition of letters, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee," of sounds, "breathe," "see," "thee," and of words. With so many uses, repetition
is one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools. It can lift or lull the listener, amplify or diminish the line, unify or diversify ideas. In fact, even rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition. Yet for all its varied uses, too much repetition can backfire. Imagine writing the same sentence
on the blackboard twenty times, again, and again, and again, and again, or imagine a young child clamoring
for her mother's attention, "Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom." Not exactly what we might call poetry. So what is poetic repetition,
and why does it work? Possibly most familiar is rhyme, the repetition of like sounds
in word endings. As with Shakespeare's example, we often encounter rhyme
at the ends of lines. Repetition in this way creates
an expectation. We begin to listen for the repetition
of those similar sounds. When we hear them, 
the found pattern is pleasurable. Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos, we hear the echo in the oral chatter. Yet, rhyme need not surface solely
at a line's end. Notice the strong "i" sound in, "So long lives this 
and this gives life to thee." This repetition of vowel sounds
is called assonance and can also be heard 
in Eminem's "Lose Yourself." Notice how the "e" and "o" sounds
repeat both within in and at the end of each line: "Oh, there goes gravity, Oh, there goes rabbit,
he choked, he so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's
to these ropes." The alternating assonance
creates its own rhythm, and invites us to try our own voices
in echoing it. Similarly, consonance is the repetition
of like consonant sounds, such as the "l" and "th" in, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee." In fact, this type of specific consonance, which occurs at the beginning of words may be familiar to you already. It's called alliteration,
or front rhyme. Great examples include tongue twisters. Betty bought some butter 
but the butter was bitter so Betty bought some better butter
to make the bitter butter better. Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent
as we trip over the consonance both within words and at their start. Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need
for variation in poetic repetition. While challenging to say, they're seen by some
as lesser imitations of poetry, or gimmicky because they hammer
so heavily on the same sounds, closer to that blackboard-style 
of repetition. Ultimately, this is the poet's 
balancing act, learning when to repeat and when to riff, when to satisfy expectations, and when to thwart them, and in that balance, 
it may be enough to remember we all live in a world of wild variation and carry with us our own breath and beat, our own repetition wherever we go.

for her mother's attention, "Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom." Not exactly what we might call poetry. So what is poetic repetition,
and why does it work? Possibly most familiar is rhyme, the repetition of like sounds
in word endings. As with Shakespeare's example, we often encounter rhyme
at the ends of lines. Repetition in this way creates
an expectation. We begin to listen for the repetition
of those similar sounds. When we hear them, 
the found pattern is pleasurable. Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos, we hear the echo in the oral chatter. Yet, rhyme need not surface solely
at a line's end. Notice the strong "i" sound in, "So long lives this 
and this gives life to thee." This repetition of vowel sounds
is called assonance and can also be heard 
in Eminem's "Lose Yourself." Notice how the "e" and "o" sounds
repeat both within in and at the end of each line: "Oh, there goes gravity, Oh, there goes rabbit,
he choked, he so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's
to these ropes." The alternating assonance
creates its own rhythm, and invites us to try our own voices
in echoing it. Similarly, consonance is the repetition
of like consonant sounds, such as the "l" and "th" in, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee." In fact, this type of specific consonance, which occurs at the beginning of words may be familiar to you already. It's called alliteration,
or front rhyme. Great examples include tongue twisters. Betty bought some butter 
but the butter was bitter so Betty bought some better butter
to make the bitter butter better. Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent
as we trip over the consonance both within words and at their start. Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need
for variation in poetic repetition. While challenging to say, they're seen by some
as lesser imitations of poetry, or gimmicky because they hammer
so heavily on the same sounds, closer to that blackboard-style 
of repetition. Ultimately, this is the poet's 
balancing act, learning when to repeat and when to riff, when to satisfy expectations, and when to thwart them, and in that balance, 
it may be enough to remember we all live in a world of wild variation and carry with us our own breath and beat, our own repetition wherever we go.

Just for a moment, focus on your breath. In slowly. Out slowly. In slowly. Out. The same pattern repeats within
every one of us and consider your pulse. The beat is built into the very
fabric of our being. Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm
and repetition. It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition, rhythm and repetition. On, and in, and on, and out. And we delight in those aspects everyday, in the rhythm of a song, the beat of the drum, the nod of your head, or in the repetition of soup cans, the rows of an orchard, the artistry of petals. Pattern can be pleasure. In language, rhythm and repetition
are often used as the building blocks for poetry. There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as, "So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see." And there's the repetition of language
at multiple levels: the repetition of letters, "So long lives this
and this gives life to thee," of sounds, "breathe," "see," "thee," and of words. With so many uses, repetition
is one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools. It can lift or lull the listener, amplify or diminish the line, unify or diversify ideas. In fact, even rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition. Yet for all its varied uses, too much repetition can backfire. Imagine writing the same sentence

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As your country's top spy, you must infiltrate the headquarters
of the evil syndicate, find the secret control panel, and deactivate their death ray. But all you have to go on 
is the following information picked up by your surveillance team. The headquarters is a massive pyramid
with a single room at the top level, two rooms on the next, and so on. The control panel is hidden
behind a painting on the highest floor that can satisfy
the following conditions: Each room has exactly three doors
to other rooms on that floor, except the control panel room, which connects to only one, there are no hallways, and you can ignore stairs. Unfortunately, 
you don't have a floor plan, and you'll only have enough time
to search a single floor before the alarm system reactivates. Can you figure out which floor
the control room is on? Pause now to solve the riddle yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To solve this problem, 
we need to visualize it. For starters, we know 
that on the correct floor there's one room, let's call it room A, with one door to the control panel room, plus one door to room B, and one to C. So there must be at least four rooms, which we can represent as circles, drawing lines between them
for the doorways. But once we connect rooms B and C, there are no other connections possible, so the fourth floor down 
from the top is out. We know the control panel has to be
as high up as possible, so let's make our way down the pyramid. The fifth highest floor 
doesn't work either. We can figure that out by drawing it, but to be sure we haven't missed
any possibilities, here's another way. Every door corresponds to a line
in our graph that makes two rooms into neighbors. So in the end, there have to be
an even number of neighbors no matter how many connections we make. On the fifth highest floor,
to fulfill our starting conditions, we'd need four rooms 
with three neighbors each, plus the control panel room
with one neighbor, which makes 13 total neighbors. Since that's an odd number,
it's not possible, and, in fact, this also rules out every
floor that has an odd number of rooms. So let's go one more floor down. When we draw out the rooms, low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this. Incidentally, the study 
of such visual models that show the connections and
relationships between different objects is known as graph theory. In a basic graph, the circles representing
the objects are known as nodes, while the connecting lines 
are called edges. Researchers studying such graphs
ask questions like, "How far is this node from that one?" "How many edges does 
the most popular node have?" "Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?" Graphs like this are often used
to map communication networks, but they can represent almost
any kind of network, from transport connections within a city and social relationships among people, to chemical interactions between proteins or the spread of an epidemic
through different locations. So, armed with these techniques,
back to the pyramid. You avoid the guards and security cameras, infiltrate the sixth floor from the top, find the hidden panel, pull some conspicuous levers, and send the death ray crashing
into the ocean. Now, time to solve the mystery of why your surveillance team
always gives you cryptic information. Hi everybody. If you liked this riddle, 
try solving these two.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Recall that the hint is that all rooms are connected to three other rooms except one that is connected to only one other room. We see from the solution in the video that a floor containing six rooms is possible and six is the smallest number for which it is possible. Would a floor having seven rooms be possible even if not the smallest?
Options: A. No, because 7 is odd, B. No, because 7 is prime, C. Yes
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the reason why the fifth highest floor does not work as a possible location for the control panel?
Options: A. Because it has an even number of rooms, B. Because it has an odd number of rooms, C. Because it has too many rooms, D. Because it has too few rooms

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Recall that the hint is that all rooms are connected to three other rooms except one that is connected to only one other room. We see from the solution in the video that a floor containing six rooms is possible and six is the smallest number for which it is possible. Would a floor having seven rooms be possible even if not the smallest?
Options: A. No, because 7 is odd, B. No, because 7 is prime, C. Yes
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the reason why the fifth highest floor does not work as a possible location for the control panel?
Options: A. Because it has an even number of rooms, B. Because it has an odd number of rooms, C. Because it has too many rooms, D. Because it has too few rooms
Correct Option: None (However, based on the transcript, the correct answer should be B)

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.8000 (The generated question is related to the topic of the ground truth question, but it doesn't directly address the same issue. However, both questions deal with the possibility of a certain floor working as a location for the control panel.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.6667 (Although the generated question doesn't have a designated correct answer, option B is the correct reason why the fifth highest floor doesn't work, which is similar to the ground truth answer "A. No, because 7 is odd.")
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.7500 (The distractors in the generated question are somewhat plausible, but option C and D are less convincing.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (Both the question and options are clear and easy to understand.)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As your country's top spy, you must infiltrate the headquarters
of the evil syndicate, find the secret control panel, and deactivate their death ray. But all you have to go on 
is the following information picked up by your surveillance team. The headquarters is a massive pyramid
with a single room at the top level, two rooms on the next, and so on. The control panel is hidden
behind a painting on the highest floor that can satisfy
the following conditions: Each room has exactly three doors
to other rooms on that floor, except the control panel room, which connects to only one, there are no hallways, and you can ignore stairs. Unfortunately, 
you don't have a floor plan, and you'll only have enough time
to search a single floor before the alarm system reactivates. Can you figure out which floor
the control room is on? Pause now to solve the riddle yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To solve this problem, 
we need to visualize it. For starters, we know 
that on the correct floor there's one room, let's call it room A, with one door to the control panel room, plus one door to room B, and one to C. So there must be at least four rooms, which we can represent as circles, drawing lines between them
for the doorways. But once we connect rooms B and C, there are no other connections possible, so the fourth floor down 
from the top is out. We know the control panel has to be
as high up as possible, so let's make our way down the pyramid. The fifth highest floor 
doesn't work either. We can figure that out by drawing it, but to be sure we haven't missed
any possibilities, here's another way. Every door corresponds to a line
in our graph that makes two rooms into neighbors. So in the end, there have to be
an even number of neighbors no matter how many connections we make. On the fifth highest floor,
to fulfill our starting conditions, we'd need four rooms 
with three neighbors each, plus the control panel room
with one neighbor, which makes 13 total neighbors. Since that's an odd number,
it's not possible, and, in fact, this also rules out every
floor that has an odd number of rooms. So let's go one more floor down. When we draw out the rooms, low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this. Incidentally, the study 
of such visual models that show the connections and
relationships between different objects is known as graph theory. In a basic graph, the circles representing
the objects are known as nodes, while the connecting lines 
are called edges. Researchers studying such graphs
ask questions like, "How far is this node from that one?" "How many edges does 
the most popular node have?" "Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?" Graphs like this are often used
to map communication networks, but they can represent almost
any kind of network, from transport connections within a city and social relationships among people, to chemical interactions between proteins or the spread of an epidemic
through different locations. So, armed with these techniques,
back to the pyramid. You avoid the guards and security cameras, infiltrate the sixth floor from the top, find the hidden panel, pull some conspicuous levers, and send the death ray crashing
into the ocean. Now, time to solve the mystery of why your surveillance team
always gives you cryptic information. Hi everybody. If you liked this riddle, 
try solving these two.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: We see from the solution in the video that a floor containing six rooms is possible and six is the smallest number for which it is possible. Would a floor having eight rooms be possible even if not the smallest?

**Transcript**:
(electronic instrumental music) (tape rewinding) - [Sally] Ever been to Disneyland? That was definitely an E ticket. - [Voiceover] Shuttle Control Houston. That was Mission Specialist Sally Ride comparing her flight to Disneyland. - [Sally] I wish that there had been another woman on my flight. I wish that two of us
had gone up together. I think it would have been a lot easier. - [Gloria] It’s tough being the first, but you’ve done it with incredible grace. You also have the only job in the world that everybody understands. (laughing) - [Sally] My father, I
think, was so grateful when I became an astronaut because he did not understand astrophysicist. He couldn’t relate to that at all, but astronaut was something
he felt he understood. - [Gloria] But you could see
people all over the world connecting with what you were doing. - [Sally] Roughly half the people in the world would love to be astronauts, would give anything to
trade places with you, and the other half just can’t understand why in the world you would
do something that stupid. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] You don’t have 20-20 vision, can you become an astronaut candidate? I always thought that was
a big disabling factor. - [Sally] I think it used to be. Now as long as it’s correctable
to 20-20, it’s okay. So you’d probably qualify. (laughing) (upbeat instrumental music) I didn’t have any dreams about
being an astronaut at all and I don’t understand that because as soon as the opportunity was
open to me, I jumped at it. And I instantly realized that that was what I really wanted to do. I took all the science
classes that I could all the way through junior high
school and into high school. I went to a girls’
school that really didn’t have a strong science program
at all when I was there. At the time it was a
classic school for girls, with a good tennis team
and a good English teacher and essentially no math
past eleventh grade and no physics and no chemistry. - [Gloria] I’m curious about the reception that you got inside NASA. What kind of thing happened to you? - [Sally] Really the only bad moments in our training involved the press. The press was an added
pressure on the flight for me and whereas NASA appeared to be very enlightened about flying women astronauts, the press didn’t appear to be. The things that they were concerned with were not the same things
that I was concerned with. - [Gloria] For instance,
the bathroom facilities. - [Sally] The bathroom facilities. - [Gloria] How much
did you get asked that? - [Sally] Just about every
interview I got asked that. Everybody wanted to know about what kind of makeup I was taking up. They didn’t care about how well-prepared I was to operate the arm or deploy communications satellites. - [Gloria] Did NASA try to prepare you for the press and the pressure? - [Sally] Unfortunately, no, they don’t. You know, in my case, they took a graduate student in physics who had spent her life in the basement of a physics department with oscilloscopes and suddenly put me in front of the press. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What do you
suppose are the dumbest kinds of questions you’ve
been asked to date? - [Sally] Without a doubt, I think the worst question
that I have gotten was whether I cried when we got malfunctions in the simulator. (laughing) No. - [Gloria] That surpassed even the one about whether you’re going
to wear a bra or not. Did somebody really ask you that? - [Sally] No. The press, I think, decided
that that was a good question for someone to have asked me and for me to have answered
but I never got that question. - [Gloria] And they made you
up quite a good response. Something about "in a
state of weightlessness "it doesn’t matter,"
or something like that? - [Sally] Yeah, it was
something like that. - [Gloria] They made up this whole thing? - [Sally] Yeah, I was
never asked that question. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What about your
feelings during the launch? Was there any time that the enormity of what was going on came over you? - [Sally] The moment of the launch, when the engines actually ignited and the solid rockets lit, everyone on the crew
was, for a few seconds, just overcome with what
was about to happen to us. But a year of training is a long time. A year of sitting in simulators and being told exactly
what’s going to happen. And you hear the sounds and
you feel the vibrations. And they prepare you
very well and it worked. We were able to overcome being overcome and do the things that
we were supposed to do. - [Gloria] Just watching
there at the launch, there were people with tears
streaming down their faces, people I never would have expected and yet they were all very moved by, I guess, the human audacity of it. - [Sally] I think that to imagine, when you see the long trail of flame, and then to imagine that there are really people inside
that, that’s really something. Inside, of course, you don’t see the long trail of flame and what you’re feeling is
really more of an exhilaration. - [Gloria] Well, there are lots of people looking up there feeling proud, not only of you up there
but also on the ground. Thank you. - [Sally] Thank you. (inspirational instrumental music) - [Voiceover] This special

squarespace.com/blankonblank for a special offer. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What do you think it might be like in 2001, in fact? What’s possible for us? - [Sally] Well, 2001 is a long ways in the future to speculate on, but probably the next step
after the space shuttle is gonna be to be a space station. I would foresee a space station as being not just something
that is orbiting the earth and used for experimentation or whatever, but would also be used
as a launching platform back to the Moon or to Mars. And I think both of those are inevitable. I’m sure we’ll go back to the Moon and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before we send people to Mars. - [Gloria] Do you have any speculation about how long it might be perhaps before there are such things
as peopled space colonies? - [Sally] I’d guess that probably by the year 2000 there will be. I think that we’ll have a space station by the end of this decade. - [Gloria] On which it would be possible to live for long periods of time? - [Sally] Yes.

after the space shuttle is gonna be to be a space station. I would foresee a space station as being not just something
that is orbiting the earth and used for experimentation or whatever, but would also be used
as a launching platform back to the Moon or to Mars. And I think both of those are inevitable. I’m sure we’ll go back to the Moon and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before we send people to Mars. - [Gloria] Do you have any speculation about how long it might be perhaps before there are such things
as peopled space colonies? - [Sally] I’d guess that probably by the year 2000 there will be. I think that we’ll have a space station by the end of this decade. - [Gloria] On which it would be possible to live for long periods of time? - [Sally] Yes.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 4, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Ah, spring. Grass growing, flowers blooming,
trees growing new leaves, but if you get allergies, this explosion of new life probably
inspires more dread than joy. Step outside, and within minutes,
you're sneezing and congested. Your nose is running, your eyes are swollen and watery, your throat is itchy. For you and millions of others,
it's seasonal allergy time. So what's behind this onslaught of mucus? The answer lies within you. It's your immune system. Seasonal allergies, also called hay fever,
or allergic rhinitis, are a hypersensitive immune response
to something that's not actually harmful. Pollen from trees and grass, and mold spores from tiny fungi
find their way into your mucous membranes and your body attacks 
these innocuous travelers the same way it would infectious bacteria. The immune system has a memory. When a foreign substance gets tagged
as threatening, white blood cells produce 
customized antibodies that will recognize the offender
the next time around. They then promptly recruit
the body's defense team. But sometimes, the immune system
accidentally discriminates against harmless substances,
like pollen. When it wafts in again, antibodies
on the surface of white blood cells recognize it and latch on. This triggers the cell to release
inflammatory chemicals, like histamine, which stimulate nerve cells, and cause blood vessels in the mucous 
membranes to swell and leak fluid. In other words, itchiness, sneezing,
congestion, and a runny nose. Allergies usually, but not always, show up
for the first time during childhood. But why do some people get allergies
and others don't? Allergies tend to run in families,
so genetics may be one culprit. In fact, errors in a gene that helps
regulate the immune system are associated 
with higher rates of allergies. The environment 
you grow up in matters, too. Being exposed to an allergen as a baby makes you less likely to actually develop
an allergy to it. People who grow up on farms, in big families, and in the developing world also tend
to have fewer allergies, although there are plenty of exceptions,
partly thanks to genetics. One theory is that as children, they encounter more of the microbes
and parasites that co-evolved with traditional
hunter-gatherer societies. Called the hygiene hypothesis, the idea is that when the immune system isn't exposed 
to the familiar cast of microbes, it'll keep itself busy mounting
defenses against harmless substances, like pollen. Another theory is that an immune system
toughened up by a barrage of pathogens is less likely to overreact to allergens. Pollen is a common offender,
just because we encounter so much of it, but there's a long list of substances: dust, animal dander, insect venom, medications, certain foods, that can send your immune system
into overdrive. Some of these reactions can be scary. An allergy can develop
into full-blown anaphylaxis, which typically brings on severe swelling, shortness of breath, and very low blood pressure. It can be deadly. The body can even have 
an allergic reaction to itself causing auto-immune disorders, like multiple sclerosis, lupus,
and type 1 diabetes. But even non-life threatening allergy
symptoms can make you miserable, so what can you do about it? Medications can help reduce the symptoms. The most common ones keep histamines
from binding to your cells. These antihistamines 
stop the inflammation response. Steroids can help dial down 
the immune system. Another more permanent option
is immunotherapy. Deliberate, controlled exposure to gradually increasing 
amounts of an allergen can teach the immune system
that it isn't dangerous after all. And if you're really adventurous,
there's a less traditional option: intestinal parasites. When hookworms sink their teeth
into the intestinal wall, they secrete chemicals 
that blunt the immune system. Some studies suggest that hookworms
can treat allergies, which may be another reason allergies are more common 
in industrialized countries where hookworms are few
and far between. Of course, you can always just wait
your seasonal allergies out. The spring pollen onslaught dwindles
by mid-summer, just in time for ragweed season.

**Transcript**:
Ralph Waldo Emerson is the father of
American literature. In a series of strikingly original essays, written in
the mid-nineteenth century, he fundamentally changed the way that
America saw its cultural and artistic possibilities, and he enabled a
separation from transatlantic literary traditions. "We have listened too long...", he wrote, "...to the Courtly muses of Europe." Emerson's abjection of cultural
traditions brought about what one contemporary called: "America's
intellectual declaration of independence." and he established generational conflict
and transformation as commanding ideas in American literature. Emerson himself hardly seemed destined
to fit a revolutionary mold. He was born in 1803, the son of a Boston
preacher, and was descended from a line of New England ministers that went back
to the bedrock of seventeenth-century Puritanism. When his father died in 1811, 
his mother took in boarders to pay the rent. Still, she sent her son to Harvard in
1817, and then Harvard divinity school to train for the priesthood in 1825. As a young man, Emerson was strongly influenced by a
remarkable aunt of his: Mary Moody Emerson, who though self-taught, had read
everything from Shakespeare to the romantics and it formed a unique
religious perspective based on piety nature and literature, that would
resonate powerfully in the life and work of her nephew. So when Emerson was ordained in 1829,
marrying the love of his life Ellen Tucker in the same year, he was
already unsatisfied with the formal nature of New England religious
orthodoxy. When Ellen died of tuberculosis just two years later, he
resigned from the church and soon after embarked on a trip to Europe. Leaving on Christmas Day 1832,
two crucial things happened to Emerson on that tour of europe. In Paris, he went to the famous "Jardin des Plantes", a botanical and zoological garden. There he had an epiphany. Writing in his journal that: "I feel the
centipede in me, the Cayman, carp, eagle and Fox... ...I am moved by strange sympathies. I say
continually: I will be a naturalist.". Emerson's insight was that nature is in us, a part of us, and not just its higher forms, but in all its grotesquerie and
wildness. The second thing that happened on that
tour, was that Emerson met the English romantic poets: Samuel Taylor Coleridge
and William Wordsworth, and found them rather ordinary, dry 
and conservative men. The insight that Emerson drew from this, was that if great men could be so
ordinary, why should not ordinary men be great? as he would write a few years later, meek young men grow up in libraries, believing
it their duty, to accept the views which Cicero, Locke, Bacon have given. Forgetful
that Cicero, Locke and Bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote
these books. Emerson had found two ideas that would
guide his life's work. That man and nature are one and that everyone can
recognize that they are a uniquely, significant human being. On his return to America in 1833, Emerson
became a professional lecturer giving talks on natural history and literature in halls around New England. He remarried and had several children, presenting a stolid, bourgeois
appearance to the world. But his inner life was full of
turbulence and originality. In his 1836 essay, "Nature", Emerson outlined the germ of a new
philosophy, a key element of this, was the importance of American originality. In
its opening lines, Emerson wrote: "Our age is retrospective, it builds the sepulchres
of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories and criticism. The foregoing
generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we
also enjoy an original relation to the universe?". America, needed to stop looking
back to its European heritage and start looking about it self. No past moment was more important,
than the present moment. No tradition was more important, than
novelty. No generation, was better than the current generation. Everything that
matters is here now insisted Emerson, and that here was: America. This was an extension of Emerson's ideas,
about the significance of the individual that came under the heading of what he
called "self-reliance". Everywhere Emerson looked, he saw people leading lives that were based on tradition, that were limited by religious forms and social
habits. No one could be themselves, Emerson
thought, because they were all too busy being what they were supposed to be. Emerson wanted to get rid of each of
these burdens: the past, religion and social forms, so that each person could
find out who they truly were. As he put it: "History is an impertinence and an injury; Our religion, we have not chosen, but
society has chosen for us... And... ...Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the
manhood of every one of its members." We must, he argued, live from within
trusting nothing but our own intuitions. For, as he concluded... ...nothing is at last sacred but the
integrity of your own mind. This leaves open a vital question: What
is your nature... ...once you've rid yourself of history,
tradition and religion? What can be said is that it isn't
necessarily self-indulgence, haterism or narcissism. Rather, it's the surrender to that force
which Emerson recognized back in the Jardin des Plantes. An obedience to nature itself. By nature, Emerson seem to mean the natural world: 
plants, animals, rocks and sky, but what he really meant was God. Emerson was a "Pantheist". That is, someone
who believe that God exists in every part of creation, from the smallest grain
of sand to the stars. But also crucially that the divine spark
is in each of us. In following ourselves, we are therefore not merely being fickle or selfish, we are rather, releasing a divine will, that history, society and organized religion normally hide from us. The individual as
Emerson writes "is a God in ruins". But we have it within us, by casting off all
custom to rebuild ourselves Emerson makes this Pantheist connection,
explicit in what are perhaps his most famous lines. "Crossing a bear common, in
snow puddles at twilight under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any
occurrence of special good fortune, I've enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am
glad to the brink of fear, standing on the bare ground, my head
bathed by the blythe air and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes... ...I become a transparent eyeball... ...I am nothing... ...I see all. The currents of
the universal being circulate through me... ...I am part or particle of God! In the Romantic tradition on which
Emerson draws, it is the sublime, great mountains, rushing torrance, dark forests, which releases the inner vision as we find ourselves in all of them. For Emerson, it's a perfectly dull walk across an
ordinary common on a dark winter's evening that brings him, to the brink of fear. Emerson's God, is in the snow puddles too. Stood there on the common, he disappears, becoming nothing as the
currents of God flow through him. What is left is just, a transparent
eyeball. Such transcendent moments are rare, but they reveal an essential
connection between nature, God and man. They are one. They also give Emerson a proper sense of
each individual's importance, as a part of God. Transcendentalism became the name of the
movement that grew up around Emerson, at this time. Another aspect of the epiphany
that was to have a profound effect on American literature, was the
emphasis on the value of the ordinary. What Emerson put forward in essays like
"The American scholar" and "the poet", was that the American every day, was a proper
subject for literature. This was because for Emerson, the
transcendentalist God is everywhere, and it's the poet's job to reveal this. "There is no object...", he wrote, "...so foul that
intense light will not make it beautiful." "...Even a corpse has its own beauty." This
coming from a man who had opened his first wife's tomb a year after her death... ...to take a look! The great American writers, who followed Emerson, were liberated by his work to
look around and write about what they saw and how they lived, transforming the everyday into a vital
symbol of something higher and more elusive. Henry David Thoreau's two years
at Walden Pond, became a book that showed the cosmos reflected in the depths of
the waters of a mere pond. The poet Walt Whitman said: "I was
simmering, simmering, simmering... ...Emerson brought me to a boil." Emily Dickinson heard a fly and could
write of the other side of death. The novelist Herman Melville, took a whaling voyage, and made it an allegory
of American imperialism and the defiance of nature. In the 20th century, the
American critic Harold Bloom looked back at Emerson's originality and saw in it
the origin of: "The strong tradition of American poets." From Robert Frost and
Wallace Stevens to John Ashbery, Emerson's legacy to american literature
and culture and indeed to the world, was one of ceaseless invention and forward
momentum. As he put it: "I unsettle all things... ...no facts are to me sacred, none are profane... ...I simply experiment an endless seeker
with no past at my back." people of Paul pronouncing his name if you don't

custom to rebuild ourselves Emerson makes this Pantheist connection,
explicit in what are perhaps his most famous lines. "Crossing a bear common, in
snow puddles at twilight under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any
occurrence of special good fortune, I've enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am
glad to the brink of fear, standing on the bare ground, my head
bathed by the blythe air and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes... ...I become a transparent eyeball... ...I am nothing... ...I see all. The currents of
the universal being circulate through me... ...I am part or particle of God! In the Romantic tradition on which
Emerson draws, it is the sublime, great mountains, rushing torrance, dark forests, which releases the inner vision as we find ourselves in all of them. For Emerson, it's a perfectly dull walk across an
ordinary common on a dark winter's evening that brings him, to the brink of fear. Emerson's God, is in the snow puddles too. Stood there on the common, he disappears, becoming nothing as the
currents of God flow through him. What is left is just, a transparent
eyeball. Such transcendent moments are rare, but they reveal an essential
connection between nature, God and man. They are one. They also give Emerson a proper sense of
each individual's importance, as a part of God. Transcendentalism became the name of the
movement that grew up around Emerson, at this time. Another aspect of the epiphany
that was to have a profound effect on American literature, was the
emphasis on the value of the ordinary. What Emerson put forward in essays like
"The American scholar" and "the poet", was that the American every day, was a proper
subject for literature. This was because for Emerson, the
transcendentalist God is everywhere, and it's the poet's job to reveal this. "There is no object...", he wrote, "...so foul that
intense light will not make it beautiful." "...Even a corpse has its own beauty." This
coming from a man who had opened his first wife's tomb a year after her death... ...to take a look! The great American writers, who followed Emerson, were liberated by his work to
look around and write about what they saw and how they lived, transforming the everyday into a vital
symbol of something higher and more elusive. Henry David Thoreau's two years
at Walden Pond, became a book that showed the cosmos reflected in the depths of
the waters of a mere pond. The poet Walt Whitman said: "I was
simmering, simmering, simmering... ...Emerson brought me to a boil." Emily Dickinson heard a fly and could
write of the other side of death. The novelist Herman Melville, took a whaling voyage, and made it an allegory
of American imperialism and the defiance of nature. In the 20th century, the
American critic Harold Bloom looked back at Emerson's originality and saw in it
the origin of: "The strong tradition of American poets." From Robert Frost and
Wallace Stevens to John Ashbery, Emerson's legacy to american literature
and culture and indeed to the world, was one of ceaseless invention and forward
momentum. As he put it: "I unsettle all things... ...no facts are to me sacred, none are profane... ...I simply experiment an endless seeker
with no past at my back." people of Paul pronouncing his name if you don't

**Transcript**:
It's easy to forget how vast and deep
the ocean really is. About 60% of it is actually
a cold and dark region known as the deep ocean. And it reaches down to 11,000 meters. Yet, this remote zone is also one
of the greatest habitats on Earth, harboring a huge diversity of life, from giant squids and goblin sharks to minuscule animals 
smaller than a millimeter. How do so many species thrive
in this underwater world? Over the decades, intrepid scientists
have ventured there to find out. Traveling down through the water column, pressure increases 
and light begins to wane. At 200 meters, photosynthesis stops and temperature decreases 
from surface temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius. By 1000 meters, normal sunlight
has disappeared altogether. Without light, life as we know it
seems impossible. That's why in 1844, the naturalist 
Edward Forbes wrote his Azoic Theory, Azoic, meaning without animals. Forbes was sure that nothing could survive
below 600 meters on account of the lack of light. Of course, the discovery 
of deep-sea species proved him wrong. What Forbes failed to take into account
is something called marine snow, which sounds much nicer than it is. Marine snow is basically organic matter, things like particles of dead algae,
plants, and animals, drifting down into the depths and acting as food for deep-sea animals. Largely thanks to that, 
abundant life forms exist in the darkness, adapting to a harsh reality where only
the weird and wonderful can survive. Fish with cavernous mouths, spiky teeth jutting from their jaws, and lamp-like structures 
protruding from their heads, like the anglerfish which entices prey
with its misleading glow. Several sea creatures have perfected
this lightning technique known as bioluminescence, using it to lure prey, distract predators, or attract mates. Some creatures use it for camoflauge. In parts of the water column where
only faint blue light filters through, animals bioluminesce to match the glow. Predators or prey looking up
from below are deceived by this camoflauge, unable to see the creatures silhouette. Such otherworldly adaptations also arise
from the need to locate and snatch up food before it drifts away. Some sea animals, like jellyfish,
comb jellies and salps can migrate between depths partially because 
their 90% water consistency allows them to withstand immense pressure. But they're the exception. Most deep-sea creatures are confined
to a narrow range in the water column where nutrients are scarce since the food drifting downwards
from the surface rapidly sinks to the sea floor. Plunging all the way down,
we find more exotic creatures. Some take on dwarfism, a trait that transforms them 
into miniature versions of animals we see closer to the surface. It's thought that reduced 
food availability causes the shrinkage. Only a tiny fraction of the food produced
at the surface reaches the sea floor, so being small gives animals
a low energy requirement and an adaptive advantage. And yet, the sea is also the land
of giants. Here, gargantuan squids can reach
18 meters long. Isopods scuttle around the sea floor
like enormous wood lice. There are long-limbed 
Japanese spider crabs, and oarfish, whose bodies stretch
to 15 meters. This trait is known as gigantism,
and it's something of a mystery. It's thought that high oxygen levels
may drive extreme growth in some species, while the colder temperatures promote
longer life spans, giving animals the opportunity 
to grow massive. Many of these exotic sea beasts will never
experience sunlight. Some will venture up through
the water column to feed, and a few will actually break the waves, reminding us at the surface about the incredible survival skills
of the ocean's deepest inhabitants. Humans still have an astounding
95% of the ocean left to explore. So those depths remain a great mystery. What other untold wonders lie far below,
and which ones will we discover next?

**Transcript**:
One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe
be dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of
its expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that
scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe
must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point
it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up
and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but
we call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and
then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have
decided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,
and we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they
lead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe
has been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces
created everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,
so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,
but here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion
accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity
can’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like
galaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects
expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep
them together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand
faster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,
and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless
lonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between
the Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays
intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period
of time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?
Let’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the
state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but
over time, they will cool down and disintegrate,
until it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets
bigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations
of stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,
so the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;
 black holes will slowly degenerate
and evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a
dilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
at this point; entropy is at its maximum and
the universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might
be possible that after an incredibly
long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy
decrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to
a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most
likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the
universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so
let’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account. Subtitles by the Amara.org community

**Transcript**:
One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe
be dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of
its expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that
scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe
must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point
it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up
and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but
we call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and
then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have
decided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,
and we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they
lead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe
has been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces
created everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,
so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,
but here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion
accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity
can’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like
galaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects
expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep
them together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand
faster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,
and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless
lonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between
the Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays
intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period
of time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?
Let’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the
state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but
over time, they will cool down and disintegrate,
until it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets
bigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations
of stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,
so the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;
 black holes will slowly degenerate
and evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a
dilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
at this point; entropy is at its maximum and
the universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might
be possible that after an incredibly
long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy
decrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to
a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most
likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the
universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so
let’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account. Subtitles by the Amara.org community

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] We’d like to think that we walk through
our lives completely conscious, free to choose whatever we like, totally completely in control. Not even close. Our bodies leave a lot to autopilot, which
is a good thing, because imagine having to regulate your heartbeat and your breathing
and your digestive system and your body temperature, all while not peeing your pants or falling
down. That would be hard. Many of those involuntary actions are mysterious,
annoying, just plain weird. Here are five of the human body’s strangest
out of control behaviors. Start typing “why does my” into Google
and the top result is an eye-opener. Involuntary twitching of the muscles around
the eye has a number of causes including dry eyes, caffeine, bright lights, and just like
during a tough workout, from simple fatigue. It’s usually totally harmless and eventually
goes away on its own and is a good hint that you’ve probably been looking at that screen
enough for one day. Looking at bright light can cause more than
an eye twitch. In Aristotle’s "Book of Problems" he asks “Why is it that one sneezes more
after one has looked at the sun” proving that people have been asking
a lot of the same questions for a long time and that no one told Aristotle that you’re
not supposed to stare at the sun. Like, ever. Don’t do it. The so-called photic sneeze reflex, AKA the
Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst, abbreviated "ACHOO"… yes, seriously… is
experienced by about 1 in 4 people, leading scientists to believe it is genetically heritable. While the exact cause hasn’t been pinpointed,
many scientists think it’s due crosstalk between the optic nerve and nerve that feeds
the tickling sensation in your nose. The visual cortex of sun-sneezing people is also prone
to overstimulation, which might send the sneeze sensing parts of their brain haywire. Have you ever been just about to go to sleep,
walking through the gates to Dreamland, only to have the floor pulled out from under you
and you’re suddenly falling and then you wake up! This frustrating sleep starts have another
cool medical name, hypnagogic myoclonus. When we drift off, the areas of our brain
that control motor function are inactivated in favor of those that control our sleep cycles,
which is why you can dream about riding your bike without actually moving your feet. As the sleepy part of your brain fight with
the awake and moving parts of your brain, the battle can spontaneously tip back in favor
of the motor control side and suddenly you’re like… WHOA, I'm awake. Sleep starts aren’t the only myocloni that
we experience. Hiccups are an uncontrollable contraction
of the diaphragm muscle that we use to draw air into our lungs. About a quarter second after that muscle contracts,
the vocal cords snap shut, creating the characteristic [hic]. Scientists still aren’t sure what causes
em, but possible explanations include hiccups being an evolutionary remnant from a few hundred
million years ago when our ancestors still had to pump water over their gills. Or, since hiccups mainly happen in mammals,
that they started as a way for nursing infants to clear air from their stomachs. If you want to get rid of hiccups, it seems
that increasing the amount of CO2 in your blood can do the job, which is common remedies
include drinking water, holding our breath, or breathing into a paper bag. Yawning, another long, slow, involuntary form
of breathing, is common throughout the animal kingdom and even happens in the womb. We know it’s associated with sleep and boredom,
but that doesn’t explain why it happens, and like most human behaviors, if you stop
and think about yawning long enough it starts to become a really, really weird thing to
do. Hippocrates believed that yawns released noxious
fumes that had built up in the body, but modern medicine has shown us that usually happens
on the other end of the body. We also know that about 50% of people who
observe a yawn will yawn in response, so it’s thought to be a social cue to synchronize
biological clocks. One theory says yawns might even cool the
brain slightly to make us more alert as we get bored or sleepy. Even watching someone talk for extended periods
of time can induce yawning, so next time you’re getting bored in class, tell your teacher
it’s Mother Nature’s fault. Finally, I’ll leave you with one bonus behavior:
post-micturition convulsion syndrome, or the pee shivers. This is another behavior for which scientists
haven’t quite shaken out all the details, but some believe its simply because we’re
exposing sensitive areas of our body to the cold while we expel some internal warmth. They might also arise from a bit of conflict

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] [MUSIC] We’d like to think that we walk through
our lives completely conscious, free to choose whatever we like, totally completely in control. Not even close. Our bodies leave a lot to autopilot, which
is a good thing, because imagine having to regulate your heartbeat and your breathing
and your digestive system and your body temperature, all while not peeing your pants or falling
down. That would be hard. Many of those involuntary actions are mysterious,
annoying, just plain weird. Here are five of the human body’s strangest
out of control behaviors. Start typing “why does my” into Google
and the top result is an eye-opener. Involuntary twitching of the muscles around
the eye has a number of causes including dry eyes, caffeine, bright lights, and just like
during a tough workout, from simple fatigue. It’s usually totally harmless and eventually
goes away on its own and is a good hint that you’ve probably been looking at that screen
enough for one day. Looking at bright light can cause more than
an eye twitch. In Aristotle’s "Book of Problems" he asks “Why is it that one sneezes more
after one has looked at the sun” proving that people have been asking
a lot of the same questions for a long time and that no one told Aristotle that you’re
not supposed to stare at the sun. Like, ever. Don’t do it. The so-called photic sneeze reflex, AKA the
Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst, abbreviated "ACHOO"… yes, seriously… is
experienced by about 1 in 4 people, leading scientists to believe it is genetically heritable. While the exact cause hasn’t been pinpointed,
many scientists think it’s due crosstalk between the optic nerve and nerve that feeds
the tickling sensation in your nose. The visual cortex of sun-sneezing people is also prone
to overstimulation, which might send the sneeze sensing parts of their brain haywire. Have you ever been just about to go to sleep,
walking through the gates to Dreamland, only to have the floor pulled out from under you
and you’re suddenly falling and then you wake up! This frustrating sleep starts have another
cool medical name, hypnagogic myoclonus. When we drift off, the areas of our brain
that control motor function are inactivated in favor of those that control our sleep cycles,
which is why you can dream about riding your bike without actually moving your feet. As the sleepy part of your brain fight with
the awake and moving parts of your brain, the battle can spontaneously tip back in favor
of the motor control side and suddenly you’re like… WHOA, I'm awake. Sleep starts aren’t the only myocloni that
we experience. Hiccups are an uncontrollable contraction
of the diaphragm muscle that we use to draw air into our lungs. About a quarter second after that muscle contracts,
the vocal cords snap shut, creating the characteristic [hic]. Scientists still aren’t sure what causes
em, but possible explanations include hiccups being an evolutionary remnant from a few hundred
million years ago when our ancestors still had to pump water over their gills. Or, since hiccups mainly happen in mammals,
that they started as a way for nursing infants to clear air from their stomachs. If you want to get rid of hiccups, it seems
that increasing the amount of CO2 in your blood can do the job, which is common remedies
include drinking water, holding our breath, or breathing into a paper bag. Yawning, another long, slow, involuntary form
of breathing, is common throughout the animal kingdom and even happens in the womb. We know it’s associated with sleep and boredom,
but that doesn’t explain why it happens, and like most human behaviors, if you stop
and think about yawning long enough it starts to become a really, really weird thing to
do. Hippocrates believed that yawns released noxious
fumes that had built up in the body, but modern medicine has shown us that usually happens
on the other end of the body. We also know that about 50% of people who
observe a yawn will yawn in response, so it’s thought to be a social cue to synchronize
biological clocks. One theory says yawns might even cool the
brain slightly to make us more alert as we get bored or sleepy. Even watching someone talk for extended periods
of time can induce yawning, so next time you’re getting bored in class, tell your teacher
it’s Mother Nature’s fault. Finally, I’ll leave you with one bonus behavior:
post-micturition convulsion syndrome, or the pee shivers. This is another behavior for which scientists
haven’t quite shaken out all the details, but some believe its simply because we’re
exposing sensitive areas of our body to the cold while we expel some internal warmth. They might also arise from a bit of conflict
between our autonomous nervous system that’s usually quietly keeping all that pee inside
and the part of our conscious mind that’s in charge of the plumbing at that moment. These weird, wild, and often twitchy behaviors
may defy nice, neat explanations, and yes, sometimes they are very annoying, but in the

**Transcript**:
Like many heroes of Greek myths, the philosopher Hippasus was rumored to
have been mortally punished by the gods. But what was his crime? Did he murder guests, or disrupt a sacred ritual? No, Hippasus's transgression was
a mathematical proof: the discovery of irrational numbers. Hippasus belonged to a group
called the Pythagorean mathematicians who had a religious reverence for numbers. Their dictum of, "All is number," suggested that numbers 
were the building blocks of the Universe and part of this belief was that 
everything from cosmology and metaphysics to music and morals followed eternal rules describable as ratios of numbers. Thus, any number could be written
as such a ratio. 5 as 5/1, 0.5 as 1/2 and so on. Even an infinitely extending decimal like
this could be expressed exactly as 34/45. All of these are what we now call
rational numbers. But Hippasus found one number
that violated this harmonious rule, one that was not supposed to exist. The problem began with a simple shape, a square with each side 
measuring one unit. According to Pythagoras Theorem, the diagonal length 
would be square root of two, but try as he might, Hippasus could not
express this as a ratio of two integers. And instead of giving up, he decided
to prove it couldn't be done. Hippasus began by assuming that the
Pythagorean worldview was true, that root 2 could be expressed
as a ratio of two integers. He labeled these hypothetical integers
p and q. Assuming the ratio was reduced
to its simplest form, p and q could not have any common factors. To prove that root 2 was not rational, Hippasus just had to prove that
p/q cannot exist. So he multiplied both sides 
of the equation by q and squared both sides. which gave him this equation. Multiplying any number by 2
results in an even number, so p^2 had to be even. That couldn't be true if p was odd because an odd number times itself
is always odd, so p was even as well. Thus, p could be expressed as 2a,
where a is an integer. Substituting this into the equation
and simplifying gave q^2 = 2a^2 Once again, two times any number
produces an even number, so q^2 must have been even, and q must have been even as well, making both p and q even. But if that was true, then they had
a common factor of two, which contradicted the initial statement, and that's how Hippasus concluded
that no such ratio exists. That's called a proof by contradiction, and according to the legend, the gods did not appreciate 
being contradicted. Interestingly, even though we can't
express irrational numbers as ratios of integers, it is possible to precisely plot
some of them on the number line. Take root 2. All we need to do is form a right triangle
with two sides each measuring one unit. The hypotenuse has a length of root 2,
which can be extended along the line. We can then form another
right triangle with a base of that length
and a one unit height, and its hypotenuse would equal
root three, which can be extended 
along the line, as well. The key here is that decimals and ratios
are only ways to express numbers. Root 2 simply is the hypotenuse
of a right triangle with sides of a length one. Similarly, the famous irrational number pi is always equal 
to exactly what it represents, the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter. Approximations like 22/7, or 355/113 will never precisely equal pi. We'll never know what really happened
to Hippasus, but what we do know is that his discovery
revolutionized mathematics. So whatever the myths may say,
don't be afraid to explore the impossible.

**Transcript**:
Like many heroes of Greek myths, the philosopher Hippasus was rumored to
have been mortally punished by the gods. But what was his crime? Did he murder guests, or disrupt a sacred ritual? No, Hippasus's transgression was
a mathematical proof: the discovery of irrational numbers. Hippasus belonged to a group
called the Pythagorean mathematicians who had a religious reverence for numbers. Their dictum of, "All is number," suggested that numbers 
were the building blocks of the Universe and part of this belief was that 
everything from cosmology and metaphysics to music and morals followed eternal rules describable as ratios of numbers. Thus, any number could be written
as such a ratio. 5 as 5/1, 0.5 as 1/2 and so on. Even an infinitely extending decimal like
this could be expressed exactly as 34/45. All of these are what we now call
rational numbers. But Hippasus found one number
that violated this harmonious rule, one that was not supposed to exist. The problem began with a simple shape, a square with each side 
measuring one unit. According to Pythagoras Theorem, the diagonal length 
would be square root of two, but try as he might, Hippasus could not
express this as a ratio of two integers. And instead of giving up, he decided
to prove it couldn't be done. Hippasus began by assuming that the
Pythagorean worldview was true, that root 2 could be expressed
as a ratio of two integers. He labeled these hypothetical integers
p and q. Assuming the ratio was reduced
to its simplest form, p and q could not have any common factors. To prove that root 2 was not rational, Hippasus just had to prove that
p/q cannot exist. So he multiplied both sides 
of the equation by q and squared both sides. which gave him this equation. Multiplying any number by 2
results in an even number, so p^2 had to be even. That couldn't be true if p was odd because an odd number times itself
is always odd, so p was even as well. Thus, p could be expressed as 2a,
where a is an integer. Substituting this into the equation
and simplifying gave q^2 = 2a^2 Once again, two times any number
produces an even number, so q^2 must have been even, and q must have been even as well, making both p and q even. But if that was true, then they had
a common factor of two, which contradicted the initial statement, and that's how Hippasus concluded
that no such ratio exists. That's called a proof by contradiction, and according to the legend, the gods did not appreciate 
being contradicted. Interestingly, even though we can't
express irrational numbers as ratios of integers, it is possible to precisely plot
some of them on the number line. Take root 2. All we need to do is form a right triangle
with two sides each measuring one unit. The hypotenuse has a length of root 2,
which can be extended along the line. We can then form another
right triangle with a base of that length
and a one unit height, and its hypotenuse would equal
root three, which can be extended 
along the line, as well. The key here is that decimals and ratios
are only ways to express numbers. Root 2 simply is the hypotenuse
of a right triangle with sides of a length one. Similarly, the famous irrational number pi is always equal 
to exactly what it represents, the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter. Approximations like 22/7, or 355/113 will never precisely equal pi. We'll never know what really happened
to Hippasus, but what we do know is that his discovery
revolutionized mathematics. So whatever the myths may say,
don't be afraid to explore the impossible.

**Transcript**:
If you line up the entire text 
of “Moby Dick,” which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns: like these words, which seem to predict the assassination
of Martin Luther King. Or these references 
to the 1997 death of Princess Di. So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet? The answer is no, and we know that thanks to a mathematical
principle called Ramsey theory. It's the reason we can find geometric
shapes in the night sky, it's why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number 
of hairs on their head, and it explains why patterns can be found
in just about any text... even Vanilla Ice lyrics. So what is Ramsey theory? Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure, some particular interesting pattern
among them is guaranteed to emerge. As a simple example, let’s look 
at what’s called the Party Problem— a classic illustration of Ramsey theory. Suppose there are at least six people
at a party. Amazingly enough, we can say for sure that some group of three of them
either all know each other, or have never met before, without knowing a single thing about them. We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities. Each point represents a person, and a line indicates 
that the pair know each other. Every pair only has two possibilities:
they either know each other or they don't. There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property 
that we're looking for. Six is the lowest number of guests
where that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns, but no easy way to find it. In this case, as the total number
of guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control. For instance, say you're trying
to find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people
who all know each other or all don't. Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually 
impossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this. That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities. A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms 
in the universe. Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer
to this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests. What this shows us 
is that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set. And with a very large set,
the possibilities are almost endless. Any four stars where no three 
lie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape. Expand that to the thousands 
of stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can
find all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them. So what are the chances of a text
concealing a prophecy? Well, when you factor
in  the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations 
and alternate spellings, they're pretty high. You can try it yourself. Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find. The mathematician T.S. Motzkin 
once remarked that, “while disorder is more probable 
in general, complete disorder is impossible." The sheer size of the universe guarantees
that some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns
and pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional
meaning where there may not be any. So while we may be awed by hidden messages
in everything from books, to pieces of toast, to the night sky, their real origin 
is usually our own minds.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
If you line up the entire text 
of “Moby Dick,” which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns: like these words, which seem to predict the assassination
of Martin Luther King. Or these references 
to the 1997 death of Princess Di. So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet? The answer is no, and we know that thanks to a mathematical
principle called Ramsey theory. It's the reason we can find geometric
shapes in the night sky, it's why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number 
of hairs on their head, and it explains why patterns can be found
in just about any text... even Vanilla Ice lyrics. So what is Ramsey theory? Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure, some particular interesting pattern
among them is guaranteed to emerge. As a simple example, let’s look 
at what’s called the Party Problem— a classic illustration of Ramsey theory. Suppose there are at least six people
at a party. Amazingly enough, we can say for sure that some group of three of them
either all know each other, or have never met before, without knowing a single thing about them. We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities. Each point represents a person, and a line indicates 
that the pair know each other. Every pair only has two possibilities:
they either know each other or they don't. There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property 
that we're looking for. Six is the lowest number of guests
where that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns, but no easy way to find it. In this case, as the total number
of guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control. For instance, say you're trying
to find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people
who all know each other or all don't. Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually 
impossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this. That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities. A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms 
in the universe. Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer
to this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests. What this shows us 
is that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set. And with a very large set,
the possibilities are almost endless. Any four stars where no three 
lie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape. Expand that to the thousands 
of stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can
find all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them. So what are the chances of a text
concealing a prophecy? Well, when you factor
in  the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations 
and alternate spellings, they're pretty high. You can try it yourself. Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find. The mathematician T.S. Motzkin 
once remarked that, “while disorder is more probable 
in general, complete disorder is impossible." The sheer size of the universe guarantees
that some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns
and pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional

**Transcript**:
Let's say you're on a game show. You've already earned $1000 
in the first round when you land on the bonus space. Now, you have a choice. You can either take 
a $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin. If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus. If it's tails, you get no bonus at all. In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space. Now you have another choice. You can either take a $500 loss, or try your luck at the coin flip. If it's heads, you lose nothing, but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead. If you're like most people, you probably chose to take
the guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round. But if you think about it,
this makes no sense. The odds and outcomes in both rounds
are exactly the same. So why does the second round
seem much scarier? The answer lies in a phenomenon
known as loss aversion. Under rational economic theory, our decisions should follow a simple
mathematical equation that weighs the level of risk
against the amount at stake. But studies have found 
that for many people, the negative psychological impact
we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing. Loss aversion is one cognitive bias
that arises from heuristics, problem-solving approaches based on
previous experience and intuition rather than careful analysis. And these mental shortcuts can lead
to irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily
be proven wrong. Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics. For instance, say you were to roll a die
with four green faces and two red faces twenty times. You can choose one of 
the following sequences of rolls, and if it shows up, 
you'll win $25. Which would you pick? In one study, 65% of the participants
who were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter
and contained within B, in other words, more likely. This is what's called 
a conjunction fallacy. Here, we expect to see more green rolls, so our brains can trick us into picking
the less likely option. Heuristics are also terrible 
at dealing with numbers in general. In one example, students were split
into two groups. The first group was asked whether
Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140. Both numbers were obviously way off, but when the students were then asked
to guess the actual age at which he died, the first group's answers averaged to 50 while the second group's averaged to 67. Even though the clearly wrong information
in the initial questions should have been irrelevant, it still affected the students' estimates. This is an example 
of the anchoring effect, and it's often used in marketing
and negotiations to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay. So, if heuristics lead to 
all these wrong decisions, why do we even have them? Well, because they can be quite effective. For most of human history, survival depended on making quick
decisions with limited information. When there's no time to logically
analyze all the possibilities, heuristics can sometimes save our lives. But today's environment requires
far more complex decision-making, and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think, affecting everything from health 
and education to finance and criminal justice. We can't just shut off 
our brain's heuristics, but we can learn to be aware of them. When you come to 
a situation involving numbers, probability, or multiple details, pause for a second and consider that the intuitive answer
might not be the right one after all.

a $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin. If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus. If it's tails, you get no bonus at all. In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space. Now you have another choice. You can either take a $500 loss, or try your luck at the coin flip. If it's heads, you lose nothing, but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead. If you're like most people, you probably chose to take
the guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round. But if you think about it,
this makes no sense. The odds and outcomes in both rounds
are exactly the same. So why does the second round
seem much scarier? The answer lies in a phenomenon
known as loss aversion. Under rational economic theory, our decisions should follow a simple
mathematical equation that weighs the level of risk
against the amount at stake. But studies have found 
that for many people, the negative psychological impact
we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing. Loss aversion is one cognitive bias
that arises from heuristics, problem-solving approaches based on
previous experience and intuition rather than careful analysis. And these mental shortcuts can lead
to irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily
be proven wrong. Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics. For instance, say you were to roll a die
with four green faces and two red faces twenty times. You can choose one of 
the following sequences of rolls, and if it shows up, 
you'll win $25. Which would you pick? In one study, 65% of the participants
who were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter
and contained within B, in other words, more likely. This is what's called 
a conjunction fallacy. Here, we expect to see more green rolls, so our brains can trick us into picking
the less likely option. Heuristics are also terrible 
at dealing with numbers in general. In one example, students were split
into two groups. The first group was asked whether
Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140. Both numbers were obviously way off, but when the students were then asked
to guess the actual age at which he died, the first group's answers averaged to 50 while the second group's averaged to 67. Even though the clearly wrong information
in the initial questions should have been irrelevant, it still affected the students' estimates. This is an example 
of the anchoring effect, and it's often used in marketing
and negotiations to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay. So, if heuristics lead to 
all these wrong decisions, why do we even have them? Well, because they can be quite effective. For most of human history, survival depended on making quick
decisions with limited information. When there's no time to logically
analyze all the possibilities, heuristics can sometimes save our lives. But today's environment requires
far more complex decision-making, and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think, affecting everything from health 
and education to finance and criminal justice. We can't just shut off 
our brain's heuristics, but we can learn to be aware of them. When you come to 
a situation involving numbers, probability, or multiple details, pause for a second and consider that the intuitive answer
might not be the right one after all.

Albert Einstein. The icon of genius. Why? Because he figured out E equals m c squared? Because he didn't like socks? Nope! Because he came up with the most powerful idea in science.. General Relativity His masterpiece is now 100 years old. And while the physicists are partying, the rest of us are left wondering what the BLEEP it’s all about! Well here goes. At 26 he figured out nothing less than a new theory of space and time. It led to a nifty way of simplifying physics – by treating space and time as one thing... Spacetime! But Albert was just warming up. He wasn’t happy with Isaac Newton’s mysterious force of gravity. Naturally, he started work on his own theory. And sure enough, he cracked it. Mass causes spacetime to curve! The natural motion of things is to follow the simplest path through spacetime. But since objects with mass curve spacetime, stuff moves towards the most massive objects. That’s what you feel as gravity. It’s warped space and time that’s keeping your feet on the ground. “Warped space” might sound too sci-fi to be true. But we can measure the bending of starlight as is passes through the warped space around the sun. Warped time sounds even more ridiculous. But take an accurate clock to the top of a building and you’ll see it runs slightly quicker than one on the ground! That’s because as you move away from the centre of the planet space and time are less warped. Most amazing of all, Einstein’s theory told us that our universe has a beginning. Everything is expanding out from a hot dense origin 13.8 billion years ago. But here’s the catch: We’ve spotted that the universe is expanding faster than Albert’s theory predicts. Could the old genius be wrong? To stick with his idea we’ve had to invent a made up energy - ‘dark energy’ - to account for the speedy expansion. And we’ve had to assume there’s an exotic form of ‘dark matter' we haven’t detected yet either. These two unknowns should make up 95% of the universe – yet we’ve never detected them. That’s the sort of thing that keeps physicists awake at night. So they’re plotting some seriously big experiments to put Albert’s theory to the ultimate test. For the last 100 years, uncle Albert’s great theory has passed every test possible. If it succeeds again physicists will party. If they find its limits and it finally fails they’ll party too.

In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits. Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states
for two possible values, 0 and 1. Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits, all processed in 
the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face 
a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed. Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks, and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage. When you run a program, your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key
in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them,
or create new ones. The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging
to retain data. But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered. For data to remain
once the device is turned off, it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap
and removable, they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges within their specially designed 
internal structures. So how reliable 
are these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device
and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates. Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.

within the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key
in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them,
or create new ones. The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging
to retain data. But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered. For data to remain
once the device is turned off, it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap
and removable, they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges within their specially designed 
internal structures. So how reliable 
are these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device
and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates. Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.

In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits. Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states
for two possible values, 0 and 1. Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits, all processed in 
the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing

**Transcript**:
Your cell phone is mainly made
of plastics and metals. It's easy to appreciate 
the inventive process by which those elements are made to add up
to something so useful and entertaining. But there's another story 
we don't hear about as much. How did we get our raw ingredients
in the first place from the chaotic tangle of materials
that is nature? The answer is a group of clever hacks
known as separation techniques. They work by taking advantage
of the fundamental properties of things to disentangle them from each other. Simple separation techniques
apply to many physical scenarios, like separating cream from milk, extracting water from soil, or even sifting out flecks of gold
from river sand. But not all mixtures 
are so easy to unravel. In some of those cases, we can exploit the differences between
physical properties within a mixture, like particle size, density, or boiling point to extract what's required. Take petroleum, a mixture of different 
types of hydrocarbons. Some of these are valuable as fuels, and others make good raw materials
for generating electric power. To separate them, experts rely on one
important feature: different hydrocarbons boil 
at different temperatures. During the boiling process,
each type vaporizes at a precise point, then gets separately funneled 
into a container and collected as a liquid as it cools. Separation techniques 
also take us to the sea. In some drought-stricken countries, the ocean is the only 
available water source. But of course,
humans can't drink salt water. One way to get around this problem is to remove salt from sea water 
with reverse osmosis, a process that separates 
water's ingredients by size. A membrane with pores 
bigger than water particles, but smaller than salt particles, only lets fresh water pass through, transforming what was once undrinkable
into a life saver. Meanwhile in the medical world, blood tests are a vital tool 
for evaluating a person's health, but doctors typically 
can't examine blood samples until they've separated 
the solid blood cells from the liquid plasma 
they're dissolved in. To do that, a powerful rotational force
is exerted on the test tube, causing heavier substances 
with higher density, like blood cells, to move away from the rotational axis. Meanwhile, lighter substances 
with lower density, like plasma, move to its center. The tube's contents divide clearly, and the blood cells and liquid plasma
can be tested independently. But sometimes, unlike oil,
seawater, and blood, the parts of mixtures 
that we want to separate share the same physical properties. In these cases, the only way to isolate 
ingredients is by chemical separation, a complex process that relies 
on unique interactions between components within a mixture
and another material. One of these methods is chromatography, a tool forensic scientists use 
to examine crime scenes. They dissolve gathered evidence in a gas, and can monitor 
and analyze the ingredients as they separate 
and move at varying speeds due to their unique chemical properties. That information then tells scientists
precisely what was present at the scene, often helping to identify the culprit. Separation techniques are not just about
industry, infrastructure, medicine, and justice. One of the most technically ambitious
projects in human history is a separation technique aimed at
answering the fundamental question, "What is the Universe made of?" By accelerating particles 
to extremely high speeds and smashing them into each other, we can break them into 
their constituent parts ever so briefly. And if we succeed at that, what's next? Is there a most elementary particle? And if so, what's it made of?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your cell phone is mainly made
of plastics and metals. It's easy to appreciate 
the inventive process by which those elements are made to add up
to something so useful and entertaining. But there's another story 
we don't hear about as much. How did we get our raw ingredients
in the first place from the chaotic tangle of materials
that is nature? The answer is a group of clever hacks
known as separation techniques. They work by taking advantage
of the fundamental properties of things to disentangle them from each other. Simple separation techniques
apply to many physical scenarios, like separating cream from milk, extracting water from soil, or even sifting out flecks of gold
from river sand. But not all mixtures 
are so easy to unravel. In some of those cases, we can exploit the differences between
physical properties within a mixture, like particle size, density, or boiling point to extract what's required. Take petroleum, a mixture of different 
types of hydrocarbons. Some of these are valuable as fuels, and others make good raw materials
for generating electric power. To separate them, experts rely on one
important feature: different hydrocarbons boil 
at different temperatures. During the boiling process,
each type vaporizes at a precise point, then gets separately funneled 
into a container and collected as a liquid as it cools. Separation techniques 
also take us to the sea. In some drought-stricken countries, the ocean is the only 
available water source. But of course,
humans can't drink salt water. One way to get around this problem is to remove salt from sea water 
with reverse osmosis, a process that separates 
water's ingredients by size. A membrane with pores 
bigger than water particles, but smaller than salt particles, only lets fresh water pass through, transforming what was once undrinkable
into a life saver. Meanwhile in the medical world, blood tests are a vital tool 
for evaluating a person's health, but doctors typically 
can't examine blood samples until they've separated 
the solid blood cells from the liquid plasma 
they're dissolved in. To do that, a powerful rotational force
is exerted on the test tube, causing heavier substances 
with higher density, like blood cells, to move away from the rotational axis. Meanwhile, lighter substances 
with lower density, like plasma, move to its center. The tube's contents divide clearly, and the blood cells and liquid plasma
can be tested independently. But sometimes, unlike oil,
seawater, and blood, the parts of mixtures 
that we want to separate share the same physical properties. In these cases, the only way to isolate 
ingredients is by chemical separation, a complex process that relies 
on unique interactions between components within a mixture
and another material. One of these methods is chromatography, a tool forensic scientists use 
to examine crime scenes. They dissolve gathered evidence in a gas, and can monitor 
and analyze the ingredients as they separate 
and move at varying speeds due to their unique chemical properties. That information then tells scientists
precisely what was present at the scene, often helping to identify the culprit. Separation techniques are not just about
industry, infrastructure, medicine, and justice. One of the most technically ambitious
projects in human history is a separation technique aimed at
answering the fundamental question, "What is the Universe made of?" By accelerating particles 
to extremely high speeds and smashing them into each other, we can break them into 
their constituent parts ever so briefly. And if we succeed at that, what's next? Is there a most elementary particle? And if so, what's it made of?

**Transcript**:
Massive vines that blanket
the southern United States, climbing as high as 100 feet as they
uproot trees and swallow buildings. A ravenous snake that is capable of
devouring an alligator. Rabbit populations that eat
themselves into starvation. These aren't horror movie concepts. They're real stories, but how could such situations
exist in nature? All three are examples
of invasive species, organisms harmful not because
of what they are, but where they happen to be. The kudzu vine, for example, had grown quality in its native east Asia,
eaten by various insects and dying off during the cold winters. But its fortunes changed when it was imported 
into the southeastern United States for porch decoration and cattle feed. Its planting was even subsidized
by the government to fight soil erosion. With sunny fields, a mild climate,
and no natural predators in its new home, the vine grew uncontrollably until it became known as the plant
that ate the South. Meanwhile in Florida's Everglades,
Burmese pythons, thought to have been released
by pet owners, are the cause of decreasing populations
of organisms. They're successfully outcompeting
top predators, such as the alligator and panther, causing a significant reduction
in their food sources. They're not a problem
in their native Asia because diseases, parasites, and predators
help to control their population size. And in Australia, European rabbits
eat so many plants that they wipe out the food supply
for themselves and other herbivores. They're a pretty recent addition, intentionally introduced to the continent
because one man enjoyed hunting them. Like the Burmese pythons, various factors in their native habitat
keep their numbers in control. But in Australia, the lack of predators and a climate perfect 
for year-long reproduction allows their populations to skyrocket. So why does this keep happening? Most of the world's ecosystems are the result of millennia 
of coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment 
and each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance
via limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict
the size or range of a species. These include things 
like natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends
on levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects
the population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores
that feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps
the herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor
can upset this balance, and the sudden introduction
of non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved
in a separate habitat will be susceptible to different 
limiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat's limiting factors
fail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms
for resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem. Species are sometimes introduced
into new habitats through natural factors, like storms, ocean currents, or climate shifts. The majority of invasive species,
though, are introduced by humans. Often this happens unintentionally, as when the zebra mussel was accidentally
brought to Lake Erie by cargo ships. But as people migrate around the world, we have also deliberately brought
our plants and animals along, rarely considering the consequences. But now that we're learning more about the effects of invasive species
on ecosystems, many governments closely monitor
the transport of plants and animals, and ban the imports of certain organisms. But could the species with
the most drastic environmental impact be a group of primates who emerged
from Africa to cover most of the world? Are we an invasive species?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication
as an exchange of information, then plants seem to be 
active communicators. They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,
or the Internet. And if we can learn to speak to them
on their terms, we may gain a powerful new tool to protect
crops and other valuable species. It all makes you wonder 
what else are we missing?

of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication
as an exchange of information, then plants seem to be 
active communicators. They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,
or the Internet. And if we can learn to speak to them
on their terms, we may gain a powerful new tool to protect
crops and other valuable species. It all makes you wonder 
what else are we missing?

**Transcript**:
Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues

**Transcript**:
If you visit a museum with a collection
of modern and contemporary art, you're likely to see works that sometimes
elicit the response, "My cat could make that,
so how is it art?" A movement called Abstract Expressionism,
also known as the New York School, gets this reaction particularly often. Abstract Expressionism started in 1943 and developed after the end of
World War II. It's characterized by large,
primarily abstract paintings, all-over compositions 
without clear focal points, and sweeping swaths of paint
embodying and eliciting emotions. The group of artists who are considered
Abstract Expressionists includes Barnett Newman 
with his existential zips, Willem de Kooning, famous 
for his travestied women, Helen Frankenthaler, 
who created soak-stains, and others. But perhaps the most famous, influential,
and head-scratching one was Jackson Pollock. Most of his paintings 
are immediately recognizable. They feature tangled messes
of lines of paint bouncing around in every direction
on the canvas. And sure, these fields of chaos are big
and impressive, but what's so great about them? Didn't he just drip the paint at random? Can't anyone do that? Well, the answer to these questions
is both yes and no. While Pollock implemented a technique
anyone is technically capable of regardless of artistic training, only he could have made his paintings. This paradox relates to his work's roots in the Surrealist automatic drawings
of André Masson and others. These Surrealists supposedly drew
directly from the unconscious to reveal truths hidden 
within their minds. Occasionally, instead of picturing 
something and then drawing it, they let their hands move automatically and would later tease out familiar figures
that appeared in the scribbles. And after Pollock moved away 
from representation, he made drip, or action, paintings
following a similar premise, though he developed a signature technique and never looked for images or messages
hidden in the works. First, he took the canvas off of the easel
and laid it on the floor, a subversive act in itself. Then, in a controlled dance, he stepped
all around the canvas, dripping industrial paint onto it
from stirrers and other tools, changing speed and direction to control how the paint 
made contact with the surface. These movements, 
like the Surrealist scribbles, were supposedly born 
out of Pollock's subconscious. But unlike the Surrealists, whose pictures represented 
the mind's hidden contents, Pollock's supposedly made physical
manifestations of his psyche. His paintings are themselves
signatures of his mind. In theory, anyone could make a painting
that is an imprint of their mind. So why is Pollock so special? Well, it's important to remember that
while anyone could have done what he did, he and the rest of the New York School
were the ones who actually did it. They destroyed conventions of painting
that had stood for centuries, forcing the art world to rethink
them entirely. But one last reason why Jackson Pollock's
work has stayed prominent stems from the specific objects he made,
which embody fascinating contradictions. For instance, while Pollock's process resulted in radically flat 
painted surfaces, the web of painted lines can create
the illusion of an infinite layered depth when examined up close. And the chaos of this tangled mess seems
to defy all control, but it's actually the product
of a deliberate, though not pre-planned, process. These characteristics made Pollock
into a celebrity, and within art history, they also elevated him 
to the mythified status of the genius artist as hero. So rather than evening the playing field
for all creative minds, his work unfortunately reinforced
a long-standing elitist aspect of art. Elitist, innovative, whatever you choose to call it, the history embedded 
in Abstract Expressionism is one that no cat, however talented,
can claim.

**Transcript**:
If you visit a museum with a collection
of modern and contemporary art, you're likely to see works that sometimes
elicit the response, "My cat could make that,
so how is it art?" A movement called Abstract Expressionism,
also known as the New York School, gets this reaction particularly often. Abstract Expressionism started in 1943 and developed after the end of
World War II. It's characterized by large,
primarily abstract paintings, all-over compositions 
without clear focal points, and sweeping swaths of paint
embodying and eliciting emotions. The group of artists who are considered
Abstract Expressionists includes Barnett Newman 
with his existential zips, Willem de Kooning, famous 
for his travestied women, Helen Frankenthaler, 
who created soak-stains, and others. But perhaps the most famous, influential,
and head-scratching one was Jackson Pollock. Most of his paintings 
are immediately recognizable. They feature tangled messes
of lines of paint bouncing around in every direction
on the canvas. And sure, these fields of chaos are big
and impressive, but what's so great about them? Didn't he just drip the paint at random? Can't anyone do that? Well, the answer to these questions
is both yes and no. While Pollock implemented a technique
anyone is technically capable of regardless of artistic training, only he could have made his paintings. This paradox relates to his work's roots in the Surrealist automatic drawings
of André Masson and others. These Surrealists supposedly drew
directly from the unconscious to reveal truths hidden 
within their minds. Occasionally, instead of picturing 
something and then drawing it, they let their hands move automatically and would later tease out familiar figures
that appeared in the scribbles. And after Pollock moved away 
from representation, he made drip, or action, paintings
following a similar premise, though he developed a signature technique and never looked for images or messages
hidden in the works. First, he took the canvas off of the easel
and laid it on the floor, a subversive act in itself. Then, in a controlled dance, he stepped
all around the canvas, dripping industrial paint onto it
from stirrers and other tools, changing speed and direction to control how the paint 
made contact with the surface. These movements, 
like the Surrealist scribbles, were supposedly born 
out of Pollock's subconscious. But unlike the Surrealists, whose pictures represented 
the mind's hidden contents, Pollock's supposedly made physical
manifestations of his psyche. His paintings are themselves
signatures of his mind. In theory, anyone could make a painting
that is an imprint of their mind. So why is Pollock so special? Well, it's important to remember that
while anyone could have done what he did, he and the rest of the New York School
were the ones who actually did it. They destroyed conventions of painting
that had stood for centuries, forcing the art world to rethink
them entirely. But one last reason why Jackson Pollock's
work has stayed prominent stems from the specific objects he made,
which embody fascinating contradictions. For instance, while Pollock's process resulted in radically flat 
painted surfaces, the web of painted lines can create
the illusion of an infinite layered depth when examined up close. And the chaos of this tangled mess seems
to defy all control, but it's actually the product
of a deliberate, though not pre-planned, process. These characteristics made Pollock
into a celebrity, and within art history, they also elevated him 
to the mythified status of the genius artist as hero. So rather than evening the playing field
for all creative minds, his work unfortunately reinforced
a long-standing elitist aspect of art. Elitist, innovative, whatever you choose to call it, the history embedded 
in Abstract Expressionism is one that no cat, however talented,
can claim.

**Transcript**:
Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

**Transcript**:
Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI

and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully

One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this

bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its
densest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly
four degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two
ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but
on the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct
within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want
to hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I
can do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we
will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took
an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you
think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some
of the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been
involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can I hold it? Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.
I will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.
Alright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28
atoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that
is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful
of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth
1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at
now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest
object? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?
If this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain
to the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros
and thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'
as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for
the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites
or SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,
defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting
temperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the
Latin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar
to the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And
with the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you
couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,
literally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of
all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave
would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled
on the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too
small and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented
the kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the
kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined
to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is
densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.
So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition
and it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the
kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives
is by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded
to a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was
otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.
It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately
known as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe
with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI
unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six
sister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled
keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts
of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault
and tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition
on which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well
no, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical
replicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was
slightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent
out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a
weigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were
made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged
over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with
it. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,
their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of
a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully
washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually
changed the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.
One this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this
is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.
And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,
four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like
Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that
have not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you
may be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer
defined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate
the kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes
in, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful
but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.
We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular
object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there
can you? You can't count how many are in there but
you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids
or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.
That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only
one isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so
expensive. And why a sphere?
Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you
can characterise the entire dimension of the object.
Well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how
do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.
So it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively
finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level
of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.
But making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.
The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere
in the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the
gap. By knowing the diameter you can determine
its volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can
the calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.
At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the
number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of
silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then
define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or
damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined
not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition
of the kilogram say "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms"
Yes. Is it - is it going to happen?
There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.
But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's
constant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.
Each one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to
bring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram
as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined
by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.
Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its

Why do cats do that? They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,
"Why do cats do that?" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure
and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points
to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity
to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by 
the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of
her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else 
you put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert 
at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything 
we do know about cats, it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators 
that hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid
and escaped to survive. So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able
to outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Cats prefer to eat:
Options: A. Less than once a day, B. 1-2 large meals a day, C. Multiple small meals each day, D. Cats do not have eating preferences

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere right now,
people are lining up to scare themselves, maybe with a thrill ride or horror movie. In fact, in October of 2015 alone, about 28 million people visited
a haunted house in the U.S. But many consider 
this behavior perplexing, asking the question, "What could possibly be fun 
about being scared?" Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad. For starters, 
fear can actually feel pretty good. When a threat triggers 
our fight or flight response, our bodies prepare for danger by releasing chemicals that change
how our brains and bodies function. This automatic response jumpstarts
systems that can aid in survival. They do this by making sure
we have enough energy and are protected from feeling pain, while shutting down nonessential systems,
like critical thought. Feeling pain-free and energized, while not getting caught up in worrisome 
thoughts that normally occupy our brains, that all sounds great, and it can be because this response
is similar, though not exactly the same to what we experience in positive,
high-arousal states, like excitement, happiness,
and even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused
on survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal 
response in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying
the natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go
from screaming to laughing within moments. Your body is already in a euphoric state. You're just relabeling the experience. And though the threat response 
is universal, research shows differences 
between individuals in how the chemicals associated
with the threat response work. This explains why some are more prone
to thrill-seeking than others. Other normal physical differences explain why some may love the dizziness
associated with a loop-de-loop, while loathing the stomach-drop sensation
of a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight
inside a haunted house, but retreat in terror 
if taken to an actual cemetery. Fear brings more 
than just a fun, natural high. Doing things that we're afraid of
can give us a nice boost of self-esteem. Like any personal challenge, whether it's running a race
or finishing a long book, when we make it through to the end, we feel a sense of accomplishment. This is true even if we know 
we're not really in any danger. Our thinking brains may know 
the zombies aren't real, but our bodies tell us otherwise. The fear feels real, so when we make it through alive, the satisfaction and sense 
of accomplishment also feel real. This is a great evolutionary adaptation. Those who had the right balance 
of bravery and wit to know when to push through the fear
and when to retreat were rewarded with survival, new food, and new lands. Finally, fear can bring people together. Emotions can be contagious, and when you see your friend
scream and laugh, you feel compelled to do the same. This is because we make sense of what
our friends are experiencing by recreating the experience ourselves. In fact, the parts of the brain
that are active when our friend screams are active in us when we watch them. This not only intensifies 
our own emotional experience, but makes us feel closer 
to those we're with. The feeling of closeness during
times of fear is aided by the hormone oxytocin
released during fight or flight. Fear is a powerful emotional experience, and anything 
that triggers a strong reaction is going to be stored in our memory
really well. You don't want to forget 
what can hurt you. So if your memory of watching a horror
film with your friends is positive and left you with a sense of satisfaction, then you'll want to do it over
and over again.

and even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused
on survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal 
response in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying
the natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go
from screaming to laughing within moments. Your body is already in a euphoric state. You're just relabeling the experience. And though the threat response 
is universal, research shows differences 
between individuals in how the chemicals associated
with the threat response work. This explains why some are more prone
to thrill-seeking than others. Other normal physical differences explain why some may love the dizziness
associated with a loop-de-loop, while loathing the stomach-drop sensation
of a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight
inside a haunted house, but retreat in terror 
if taken to an actual cemetery. Fear brings more 
than just a fun, natural high. Doing things that we're afraid of
can give us a nice boost of self-esteem. Like any personal challenge, whether it's running a race
or finishing a long book, when we make it through to the end, we feel a sense of accomplishment. This is true even if we know 
we're not really in any danger. Our thinking brains may know 
the zombies aren't real, but our bodies tell us otherwise. The fear feels real, so when we make it through alive, the satisfaction and sense 
of accomplishment also feel real. This is a great evolutionary adaptation. Those who had the right balance 
of bravery and wit to know when to push through the fear
and when to retreat were rewarded with survival, new food, and new lands. Finally, fear can bring people together. Emotions can be contagious, and when you see your friend
scream and laugh, you feel compelled to do the same. This is because we make sense of what
our friends are experiencing by recreating the experience ourselves. In fact, the parts of the brain
that are active when our friend screams are active in us when we watch them. This not only intensifies 
our own emotional experience, but makes us feel closer 
to those we're with. The feeling of closeness during
times of fear is aided by the hormone oxytocin
released during fight or flight. Fear is a powerful emotional experience, and anything 
that triggers a strong reaction is going to be stored in our memory
really well. You don't want to forget 
what can hurt you. So if your memory of watching a horror
film with your friends is positive and left you with a sense of satisfaction, then you'll want to do it over
and over again.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere right now,
people are lining up to scare themselves, maybe with a thrill ride or horror movie. In fact, in October of 2015 alone, about 28 million people visited
a haunted house in the U.S. But many consider 
this behavior perplexing, asking the question, "What could possibly be fun 
about being scared?" Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad. For starters, 
fear can actually feel pretty good. When a threat triggers 
our fight or flight response, our bodies prepare for danger by releasing chemicals that change
how our brains and bodies function. This automatic response jumpstarts
systems that can aid in survival. They do this by making sure
we have enough energy and are protected from feeling pain, while shutting down nonessential systems,
like critical thought. Feeling pain-free and energized, while not getting caught up in worrisome 
thoughts that normally occupy our brains, that all sounds great, and it can be because this response
is similar, though not exactly the same to what we experience in positive,
high-arousal states, like excitement, happiness,
and even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused
on survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal 
response in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying
the natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You've heard people say, "It's just like riding a bike" meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right? But I did something. I did something that damaged my mind. It happened on the streets of Amsterdam and I got really scared honestly. I can't ride a bike like you can anymore. Before I show you the video of what happened I need to tell you the back story. Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young. I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it. Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later. Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers. He had a challenge for me. He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it. He had only changed one thing. When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right. When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left. I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this. - And here he is ladies and gentlemen, Mr Destin Sandlin. First attempt riding the bicycle. - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't do it. You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated. In this moment I had a really deep revelation. My thinking was in a rut. This bike revealed a very deep truth to me. I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding. Therefore, knowledge is not understanding. Look I know what you're probably thinking. Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it. But that's not the case at all. The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike, in your brain, is just that complicated. Think about it. Downwards force on the pedals, leaning your whole body, pulling and pushing the handlebars, gyroscopic procession in the wheels, every single force is part of this algorithm. And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system. I do not make definitive statements that often, but I'm telling you right now, you cannot ride this bicycle. You might think you can, but you can't. I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences and I take the bike with me. It's always the same. People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it. It doesn't work. Your brain cannot handle this. For instance, this guy. I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage. Everybody thought he could do it. [crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand. So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs] Alright so, whenever you're ready. Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs] [laughing crowd] You've gotta start rolling at least. And go. Keep your feet on the pedal, go. [laughing crowd] Just keep your feet on the pedals. Alright, one more time. Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head, sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to. So here's what I did. It was a personal challenge. I stayed out here in this driveway and I practiced about 5 minutes every day. My neighbors made fun of me. I had many wrecks. But after 8 months, this happened. One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could. It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked. It was really weird though. It's like there's this trail in my brain, but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it, my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with. Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket, would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck. But at least I could ride it. My son is the closest person to me genetically and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years, that's over half his life. I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut. Are you gonna give up? - No. - Go ahead. This is how it starts. Look at this. This is such a big deal. Get up, you got it. Did you see his brain get it? So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks? In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do, which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity, am I even saying that right? Than an adult. It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults. That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child. Alright, today's bike log. I can ride smooth, I can ride fast. I'm thinking the experiment is over. OK now I'm in Amsterdam, a city that has more bicycles than people. The question is, can I ride a normal bike now. I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike, If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up. So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will. And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike. It's backwards, it's backwards. This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life. I had ridden a normal bike since I was six, but in this moment I couldn't do it any more. I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias, but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias. So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here, looking at me. Looking at the strange American, that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb. But I'm actually two levels deep into this, because I've learned and un-learned. Alright. After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself, suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm. I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment. [laughter] I've got it, I've got it, I've got it. I'm back. Oh it clicked. It clicked. I've got it, I've got it. OK there it is. There was the moment. OK I can ride a bike. I tried to explain this to the people around me, and they just didn't get it. They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes and I couldn't get anybody to believe me. That looked like I faked it, didn't it. You think I'm faking. You don't believe me. - It looked so weird... - You think I'm lying don't you. I'm not lying. I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike, and I couldn't articulate it to anyone because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike. So I learned 3 things from this experiment. I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers, I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding, and I learned that truth is truth. No matter what I think about it. So be very careful how you interpret things because you're looking at the world with a bias whether you think you are or not. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one. OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter I recommend Commander Hadfield's book which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I read it, it was awesome. If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle and my son did it as well, but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship. Not only that, but a different type of space station. He was on Mir and the International Space Station. Anyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day, audible.com/smarter, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. [crowd cheers] Everything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong. (Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it? - I can't ride it, I just build it. [laughs]

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You've heard people say, "It's just like riding a bike" meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right? But I did something. I did something that damaged my mind. It happened on the streets of Amsterdam and I got really scared honestly. I can't ride a bike like you can anymore. Before I show you the video of what happened I need to tell you the back story. Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young. I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it. Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later. Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers. He had a challenge for me. He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it. He had only changed one thing. When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right. When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left. I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this. - And here he is ladies and gentlemen, Mr Destin Sandlin. First attempt riding the bicycle. - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't do it. You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated. In this moment I had a really deep revelation. My thinking was in a rut. This bike revealed a very deep truth to me. I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding. Therefore, knowledge is not understanding. Look I know what you're probably thinking. Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it. But that's not the case at all. The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike, in your brain, is just that complicated. Think about it. Downwards force on the pedals, leaning your whole body, pulling and pushing the handlebars, gyroscopic procession in the wheels, every single force is part of this algorithm. And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system. I do not make definitive statements that often, but I'm telling you right now, you cannot ride this bicycle. You might think you can, but you can't. I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences and I take the bike with me. It's always the same. People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it. It doesn't work. Your brain cannot handle this. For instance, this guy. I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage. Everybody thought he could do it. [crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand. So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs] Alright so, whenever you're ready. Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs] [laughing crowd] You've gotta start rolling at least. And go. Keep your feet on the pedal, go. [laughing crowd] Just keep your feet on the pedals. Alright, one more time. Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head, sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to. So here's what I did. It was a personal challenge. I stayed out here in this driveway and I practiced about 5 minutes every day. My neighbors made fun of me. I had many wrecks. But after 8 months, this happened. One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could. It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked. It was really weird though. It's like there's this trail in my brain, but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it, my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with. Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket, would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck. But at least I could ride it. My son is the closest person to me genetically and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years, that's over half his life. I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut. Are you gonna give up? - No. - Go ahead. This is how it starts. Look at this. This is such a big deal. Get up, you got it. Did you see his brain get it? So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks? In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do, which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity, am I even saying that right? Than an adult. It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults. That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child. Alright, today's bike log. I can ride smooth, I can ride fast. I'm thinking the experiment is over. OK now I'm in Amsterdam, a city that has more bicycles than people. The question is, can I ride a normal bike now. I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike, If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up. So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will. And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike. It's backwards, it's backwards. This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life. I had ridden a normal bike since I was six, but in this moment I couldn't do it any more. I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias, but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias. So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here, looking at me. Looking at the strange American, that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb. But I'm actually two levels deep into this, because I've learned and un-learned. Alright. After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself, suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm. I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment. [laughter] I've got it, I've got it, I've got it. I'm back. Oh it clicked. It clicked. I've got it, I've got it. OK there it is. There was the moment. OK I can ride a bike. I tried to explain this to the people around me, and they just didn't get it. They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes and I couldn't get anybody to believe me. That looked like I faked it, didn't it. You think I'm faking. You don't believe me. - It looked so weird... - You think I'm lying don't you. I'm not lying. I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike, and I couldn't articulate it to anyone because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike. So I learned 3 things from this experiment. I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers, I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding, and I learned that truth is truth. No matter what I think about it. So be very careful how you interpret things because you're looking at the world with a bias whether you think you are or not. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one. OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter I recommend Commander Hadfield's book which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I read it, it was awesome. If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle and my son did it as well, but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship. Not only that, but a different type of space station. He was on Mir and the International Space Station.

**Transcript**:
It starts with a tickle in your throat
that becomes a cough. Your muscles begin to ache, you grow irritable, and you lose your appetite. It's official: you've got the flu. It's logical to assume that this
miserable medley of symptoms is the result of the infection
coursing through your body, but is that really the case? What's actually making you feel sick? What if your body itself
was driving this vicious onslaught? You first get ill when a pathogen
like the flu virus gets into your system, infecting and killing your cells. But this unwelcome intrusion 
has another effect: it alerts your body's immune system
to your plight. As soon as it becomes aware of infection,
your body leaps to your defense. Cells called macrophages charge in
as the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses
and infected cells. Afterwards, the macrophages release
protein molecules called cytokines whose job is to recruit and organize more virus-busting cells 
from your immune system. If this coordinated effort 
is strong enough, it'll wipe out the infection
before you even notice it. But that's just your body setting
the scene for some real action. In some cases, viruses spread further, even into the blood and vital organs. To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate, your immune system must launch
a stronger attack, coordinating its activity with the brain. That's where those unpleasant symptoms
come in, starting with the surging temperature, aches and pains, and sleepiness. So why do we experience this? When the immune system is under
serious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses. First, the vagus nerve, which runs through
the body into the brain, quickly transmits the information
to the brain stem, passing near an important area
of pain processing. Second, cytokines travel through
the body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible
for controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things. When it receives this message, the hypothalamus produces
another molecule called prostaglandin E2,
which gears it up for war. The hypothalamus sends signals
that instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature. It also makes you sleepy, and you lose your appetite and thirst. But what's the point of all of these
unpleasant symptoms? Well, we're not yet sure, but some theorize that they aid
in recovery. The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system
destroy pathogens. Sleep lets your body channel
more energy towards fighting infection. When you stop eating, your liver can
take up much of the iron in your blood, and since iron is essential 
for bacterial survival, that effectively starves them. Your reduced thirst makes 
you mildly dehydrated, diminishing transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea. Though it's worth noting that if you don't
drink enough water, that dehydration can become dangerous. Even the body's aches 
make you more sensitive, drawing attention to infected cuts
that might be worsening, or even causing your condition. In addition to physical symptoms, sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused. That's because cytokines and prostaglandin can reach even higher structures 
in your brain, disrupting the activity 
of neurotransmitters, like glutamate, endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. This affects areas like the limbic system,
which oversees emotions, and your cerebral cortex,
which is involved in reasoning. So it's actually the body's own
immune response that causes much of the discomfort
you feel every time you get ill. Unfortunately, it doesn't always
work perfectly. Most notably, millions of people
worldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system treats
normal bodily cues as threats, so the body attacks itself. But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution
have fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, 
rather than against us. The symptoms of our illnesses 
are annoying, but collectively, 
they signify an ancient process that will continue barricading our bodies
against the outside world for centuries to come.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 24, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It starts with a tickle in your throat
that becomes a cough. Your muscles begin to ache, you grow irritable, and you lose your appetite. It's official: you've got the flu. It's logical to assume that this
miserable medley of symptoms is the result of the infection
coursing through your body, but is that really the case? What's actually making you feel sick? What if your body itself
was driving this vicious onslaught? You first get ill when a pathogen
like the flu virus gets into your system, infecting and killing your cells. But this unwelcome intrusion 
has another effect: it alerts your body's immune system
to your plight. As soon as it becomes aware of infection,
your body leaps to your defense. Cells called macrophages charge in
as the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses
and infected cells. Afterwards, the macrophages release
protein molecules called cytokines whose job is to recruit and organize more virus-busting cells 
from your immune system. If this coordinated effort 
is strong enough, it'll wipe out the infection
before you even notice it. But that's just your body setting
the scene for some real action. In some cases, viruses spread further, even into the blood and vital organs. To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate, your immune system must launch
a stronger attack, coordinating its activity with the brain. That's where those unpleasant symptoms
come in, starting with the surging temperature, aches and pains, and sleepiness. So why do we experience this? When the immune system is under
serious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses. First, the vagus nerve, which runs through
the body into the brain, quickly transmits the information
to the brain stem, passing near an important area
of pain processing. Second, cytokines travel through
the body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible
for controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things. When it receives this message, the hypothalamus produces
another molecule called prostaglandin E2,
which gears it up for war. The hypothalamus sends signals
that instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature. It also makes you sleepy, and you lose your appetite and thirst. But what's the point of all of these
unpleasant symptoms? Well, we're not yet sure, but some theorize that they aid
in recovery. The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system
destroy pathogens. Sleep lets your body channel
more energy towards fighting infection. When you stop eating, your liver can
take up much of the iron in your blood, and since iron is essential 
for bacterial survival, that effectively starves them. Your reduced thirst makes 
you mildly dehydrated, diminishing transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea. Though it's worth noting that if you don't
drink enough water, that dehydration can become dangerous. Even the body's aches 
make you more sensitive, drawing attention to infected cuts
that might be worsening, or even causing your condition. In addition to physical symptoms, sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused. That's because cytokines and prostaglandin can reach even higher structures 
in your brain, disrupting the activity 
of neurotransmitters, like glutamate, endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. This affects areas like the limbic system,
which oversees emotions, and your cerebral cortex,
which is involved in reasoning. So it's actually the body's own
immune response that causes much of the discomfort
you feel every time you get ill. Unfortunately, it doesn't always
work perfectly. Most notably, millions of people
worldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system treats
normal bodily cues as threats, so the body attacks itself. But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution
have fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, 
rather than against us. The symptoms of our illnesses 
are annoying, but collectively, 
they signify an ancient process that will continue barricading our bodies
against the outside world for centuries to come.
