Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Some are longer than a blue whale. Others are barely larger 
than a grain of sand. One species unleashes one of
the most deadly venoms on Earth. Another holds a secret that's behind some 
of the greatest breakthroughs in biology. They've inhabited the ocean for at least
half a billion years, and they're still flourishing as the sea
changes around them. Jellyfish are soft-bodied sea creatures
that aren't really fish. They're part of a diverse team
of gelatinous zooplankton, zooplankton being animals that drift
in the ocean. There are more than 1,000 species
of jellyfish, and many others 
that are often mistaken for them. A noted feature of jellyfish 
is a translucent bell made of a soft delicate material
called mesoglea. Sandwiched between two layers of skin, the mesoglea is more than 95% water
held together by protein fibers. The jellyfish can contract and 
relax their bells to propel themselves. They don't have a brain or a spinal cord, but a neural net around the bell's
inner margin forms a rudimentary nervous system that can sense the ocean's currents
and the touch of other animals. Jellyfish don't have typical 
digestive systems, either. These gelatinous carnivores consume 
plankton and other small sea creatures through a hole in the underside 
of their bells. The nutrients are absorbed by
an inner layer of cells with waste excreted back through
their mouths. But the jellyfish's relatively 
simple anatomy doesn't prevent it from having
some remarkable abilities. One kind of box jellyfish has 24 eyes. Scientists think it can see color and form
images within its simple nervous system. Four of its eyes are curved 
upward on stalks. This allows the jellyfish to peer
through the surface of the water, looking for the canopy 
of the mangrove trees where it feeds. In fact, this may be one 
of the only creatures with a 360-degree view of its environment. The jellyfish's sting, which helps it
capture prey and defend itself, is its most infamous calling card. In the jelly's epidermis, cells called nematocysts
lie coiled like poisonous harpoons. When they're triggered by contact,
they shoot with an explosive force. It exerts over 550 times the pressure
of Mike Tyson's strongest punch to inject venom into the victim. Some jellyfish stings barely tingle, but others cause severe skin damage. The venom of one box jellyfish
can kill a human in under five minutes, making it one of the most potent
poisons of any animal in the world. Other jellyfish superpowers 
are less lethal. One species of jellyfish glows green
when it's agitated, mostly thanks to a biofluorescent compound
called green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Scientists isolated the gene for GFP and figured out how to insert it
into the DNA of other cells. There, it acts like a biochemical beacon, marking genetic modifications, or revealing the path 
of critical molecules. Scientists have used the glow of GFP
to watch cancer cells proliferate, track the development of Alzheimer's, and illuminate countless other
biological processes. Developing the tools and techniques
from GFP has netted three scientists
a Nobel Prize in 2008, and another three in 2014. But it's jellyfish who may be the most
successful organisms on Earth. Ancient fossils prove that jellyfish
have inhabited the seas for at least 500 million years, and maybe go back over 700 million. That's longer than any 
other multiorgan animal. And as other marine animals 
are struggling to survive in warmer and more acidic oceans, the jellyfish are thriving, and perhaps getting even more numerous. It doesn't hurt that some can lay
as many as 45,000 eggs in a single night. And there's some jellyfish 
whose survival strategy almost sounds like science fiction. When the immortal jellyfish is sick,
aging, or under stress, its struggling cells can change
their identity. The tiny bell and tentacles deteriorate and turn into an immature polyp that spawns brand new clones
of the parent. As far as we know, these are the only
animals who found a loophole when facing mortality. That's pretty sophisticated for species
that are 95% water and predate the dinosaurs.

Question 4: What is the primary function of nematocysts in jellyfish? Options: A. To capture prey and defend against predators, B. To propel themselves through the water, C. To sense ocean currents and touch, D. To absorb nutrients from the water

This question is related to the sting of jellyfish, which is the topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not specifically mention the pressure exerted by the sting.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly asks about the pressure exerted by the jellyfish's sting. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

Index: 4 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

the most deadly venoms on Earth. Another holds a secret that's behind some 
of the greatest breakthroughs in biology. They've inhabited the ocean for at least
half a billion years, and they're still flourishing as the sea
changes around them. Jellyfish are soft-bodied sea creatures
that aren't really fish. They're part of a diverse team
of gelatinous zooplankton, zooplankton being animals that drift
in the ocean. There are more than 1,000 species
of jellyfish, and many others 
that are often mistaken for them. A noted feature of jellyfish 
is a translucent bell made of a soft delicate material
called mesoglea. Sandwiched between two layers of skin, the mesoglea is more than 95% water
held together by protein fibers. The jellyfish can contract and 
relax their bells to propel themselves. They don't have a brain or a spinal cord, but a neural net around the bell's
inner margin forms a rudimentary nervous system that can sense the ocean's currents
and the touch of other animals. Jellyfish don't have typical 
digestive systems, either. These gelatinous carnivores consume 
plankton and other small sea creatures through a hole in the underside 
of their bells. The nutrients are absorbed by
an inner layer of cells with waste excreted back through
their mouths. But the jellyfish's relatively 
simple anatomy doesn't prevent it from having
some remarkable abilities. One kind of box jellyfish has 24 eyes. Scientists think it can see color and form
images within its simple nervous system. Four of its eyes are curved 
upward on stalks. This allows the jellyfish to peer
through the surface of the water, looking for the canopy 
of the mangrove trees where it feeds. In fact, this may be one 
of the only creatures with a 360-degree view of its environment. The jellyfish's sting, which helps it
capture prey and defend itself, is its most infamous calling card. In the jelly's epidermis, cells called nematocysts
lie coiled like poisonous harpoons. When they're triggered by contact,
they shoot with an explosive force. It exerts over 550 times the pressure
of Mike Tyson's strongest punch to inject venom into the victim. Some jellyfish stings barely tingle, but others cause severe skin damage. The venom of one box jellyfish
can kill a human in under five minutes, making it one of the most potent
poisons of any animal in the world. Other jellyfish superpowers 
are less lethal. One species of jellyfish glows green
when it's agitated, mostly thanks to a biofluorescent compound
called green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Scientists isolated the gene for GFP and figured out how to insert it
into the DNA of other cells. There, it acts like a biochemical beacon, marking genetic modifications, or revealing the path 
of critical molecules. Scientists have used the glow of GFP
to watch cancer cells proliferate, track the development of Alzheimer's, and illuminate countless other
biological processes. Developing the tools and techniques
from GFP has netted three scientists
a Nobel Prize in 2008, and another three in 2014. But it's jellyfish who may be the most
successful organisms on Earth. Ancient fossils prove that jellyfish
have inhabited the seas for at least 500 million years, and maybe go back over 700 million. That's longer than any 
other multiorgan animal. And as other marine animals 
are struggling to survive in warmer and more acidic oceans, the jellyfish are thriving, and perhaps getting even more numerous. It doesn't hurt that some can lay
as many as 45,000 eggs in a single night. And there's some jellyfish 
whose survival strategy almost sounds like science fiction. When the immortal jellyfish is sick,
aging, or under stress, its struggling cells can change
their identity. The tiny bell and tentacles deteriorate and turn into an immature polyp that spawns brand new clones
of the parent. As far as we know, these are the only
animals who found a loophole when facing mortality. That's pretty sophisticated for species
that are 95% water and predate the dinosaurs.

**Transcript**:
Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?

**Transcript**:
Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?

**Transcript**:
Figs are one of my favorite foods. They're sweet and floral, and there's something
about the texture that I find so delightful—the outside is soft, but the seeds in the middle
give you this totally satisfying crunch. But it turns out that many species of figs
contain the bodies of dead wasps. I'm Anna and this is Gross Science. Figs aren't exactly your typical fruit. You can think of them as packages that contain
all of the fig tree’s flowers within them. But if the flowers are trapped inside the
fig how do they get pollinated? Well, that's where fig wasps come in. In most species, pregnant female fig wasps
carrying pollen are attracted to young figs. They enter through a tiny opening at the fig’s
bottom that’s highly selective—it usually only lets in the exact species of wasps that
pollinate it. But, even the pollinators have a hard time
getting in. Most lose their wings and antennae in the
process. The wasp’s goal is to find a home for her
babies. And the perfect home is inside the fig’s
female flowers—those are the ones that would produce seeds if they were fertilized. So, the mama wasp drops a fertilized egg inside
as many of the female flowers as she can—sometimes, up to a few hundred. But she can't get to all of them. Along the way, she winds up fertilizing the
rest of the flowers with the fig pollen she's carrying, and those flowers begin developing
seeds. Once the wasp is finished laying eggs, she
usually dies inside the fig. Each baby wasp begins to grow, encased in
a protective structure that the plant forms called a gall. The male wasps mature first. When they emerge, they find the galls of the
female wasps, many of whom are their sisters, poke inside, and impregnate them before they've
even hatched! Then, the males die inside the fig, but not
before boring tiny holes through the fig’s skin. When the females do emerge, the fig has just
started producing pollen. The female wasps pick up some of that pollen
before making their way through the holes their brothers drilled, and go off to find
a new fig to start the cycle again. But the story's not over. At this point, our fig’s seeds are finally
mature and ready to be planted. And that happens when the ripe fig is eaten
by animals, which poop out the seeds, spreading fig plants far and wide. Of course, humans eat figs, too. So, when you bite into a fig are you actually
eating the bodies of dead wasps? Well, if you’re getting your figs from the
supermarket, then most likely not. See, humans and figs have a really long history—we’ve
probably been domesticating them for over 11,000 years. So, while there are over 750 species in the
world, most of the figs we eat are a species called the “common fig,” which humans
have had a huge hand in creating. In fact, some common figs are seedless and
don’t require pollination at all. Other varieties of common fig do need to be
pollinated, but have separate male and female trees, and we only eat fruits from the female
ones. I’ll put a link in the description to a
great explanation of how common fig pollination happens, but long story short, female wasps
can only manage to lay eggs in the the figs from male trees, not female ones. But they can’t tell the difference between
the two types of trees. So, if a wasp does enter a female fruit, she’ll
pollinate it, and either manage to escape or die inside the fig. And then that fig might make it to your table. Frankly, one wasp here and there isn’t enough
to deter me from eating these things. But if you're still feeling squeamish, just
think about it this way: by eating that fig, you're benefitting from a complex and in my
view, beautiful partnership—or, what’s called a “mutualism”— between two very
different species. One that’s been delicately crafted by around
90 million years of evolution. And that certainly whets my appetite—at
least for curiosity, if not for dinner. MMMM! But also ew.

**Transcript**:
In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made
from wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus,
defied the laws of both man and nature. Ignoring the warnings of his father,
he rose higher and higher. To witnesses on the ground,
he looked like a god, and as he peered down from above,
he felt like one, too. But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man
was absolute and the punishment for mortals
who attempted to cross it was severe. Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus. Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded
as a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens. He invented carpentry
and all the tools used for it. He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor. He made sculptures so lifelike
that Hercules mistook them for actual men. Though skilled and celebrated,
Daedalus was egotistical and jealous. Worried that his nephew
was a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him. As punishment, Daedalus was banished
from Athens and made his way to Crete. Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed 
with open arms by Crete's King Minos. There, acting as the palace 
technical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries. For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys
that seemed alive. He invented the ship's sail and mast,
which gave humans control over the wind. With every creation, Daedalus challenged
human limitations that had so far kept mortals
separate from gods, until finally, he broke right through. King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,
had been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love
with the king's prized bull. Under this spell, she asked Daedalus
to help her seduce it. With characteristic audacity, he agreed. Daedalus constructed a hollow
wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. With Pasiphaë hiding inside
Daedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur. This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling
such a horrible perversion of natural law. As punishment, Daedalus was forced
to construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur. When it was finished, Minos then
imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower
on the island where they were to remain 
for the rest of their lives. But Daedalus was still a genius inventor. While observing the birds
that circled his prison, the means for escape became clear. He and Icarus would fly away
from their prison as only birds or gods could do. Using feathers from the flocks
that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs
of giant wings. As he strapped the wings
to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean 
would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use. Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax
and the wings would disintegrate. In either case, they surely would die. Therefore, the key to their escape
would be in keeping to the middle. With the instructions clear,
both men leapt from the tower. They were the first mortals ever to fly. While Daedalus stayed carefully
to the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed
with the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of
divine power that came with it. Daedalus could only watch in horror
as Icarus ascended higher and higher, powerless to change his son's dire fate. When the heat from the sun melted
the wax on his wings, Icarus fell from the sky. Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequences of defying 
the natural laws of mortal men in the service of his ego, Icarus was also carried away
by his own hubris. In the end, both men paid for their departure 
from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Question 1 asks about Daedalus's occupation in his homeland of Athens, and the correct answer is "Genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor" (Option B). This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about Daedalus's description and has the correct answer as "All of the above" (Option E), which includes inventor, sculptor, and craftsman.

However, it's worth noting that the options and the phrasing of the question are not identical, so it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made
from wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus,
defied the laws of both man and nature. Ignoring the warnings of his father,
he rose higher and higher. To witnesses on the ground,
he looked like a god, and as he peered down from above,
he felt like one, too. But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man
was absolute and the punishment for mortals
who attempted to cross it was severe. Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus. Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded
as a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens. He invented carpentry
and all the tools used for it. He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor. He made sculptures so lifelike
that Hercules mistook them for actual men. Though skilled and celebrated,
Daedalus was egotistical and jealous. Worried that his nephew
was a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him. As punishment, Daedalus was banished
from Athens and made his way to Crete. Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed 
with open arms by Crete's King Minos. There, acting as the palace 
technical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries. For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys
that seemed alive. He invented the ship's sail and mast,
which gave humans control over the wind. With every creation, Daedalus challenged
human limitations that had so far kept mortals
separate from gods, until finally, he broke right through. King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,
had been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love
with the king's prized bull. Under this spell, she asked Daedalus
to help her seduce it. With characteristic audacity, he agreed. Daedalus constructed a hollow
wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. With Pasiphaë hiding inside
Daedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur. This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling
such a horrible perversion of natural law. As punishment, Daedalus was forced
to construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur. When it was finished, Minos then
imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower
on the island where they were to remain 
for the rest of their lives. But Daedalus was still a genius inventor. While observing the birds
that circled his prison, the means for escape became clear. He and Icarus would fly away
from their prison as only birds or gods could do. Using feathers from the flocks
that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs
of giant wings. As he strapped the wings
to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean 
would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use. Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax
and the wings would disintegrate. In either case, they surely would die. Therefore, the key to their escape
would be in keeping to the middle. With the instructions clear,
both men leapt from the tower. They were the first mortals ever to fly. While Daedalus stayed carefully
to the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed
with the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of
divine power that came with it. Daedalus could only watch in horror
as Icarus ascended higher and higher, powerless to change his son's dire fate. When the heat from the sun melted
the wax on his wings, Icarus fell from the sky. Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequences of defying 
the natural laws of mortal men in the service of his ego, Icarus was also carried away
by his own hubris. In the end, both men paid for their departure 
from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Are you afraid of black cats? Would you open an umbrella indoors? And how do you feel about 
the number thirteen? Whether or not you believe in them, you're probably familiar with a few
of these superstitions. So how did it happen that people
all over the world knock on wood, or avoid stepping on sidewalk cracks? Well, although they have no basis
in science, many of these weirdly specific beliefs
and practices do have equally weird
and specific origins. Because they involve supernatural causes, it's no surprise that many superstitions
are based in religion. For example. the number thirteen was
associated with the biblical Last Supper, where Jesus Christ dined 
with his twelve disciples just before being arrested and crucified. The resulting idea that having thirteen
people at a table was bad luck eventually expanded into thirteen
being an unlucky number in general. Now, this fear of the number thirteen,
called triskaidekaphobia, is so common that many buildings around 
the world skip the thirteenth floor, with the numbers going straight from
twelve to fourteen. Of course, many people consider
the story of the Last Supper to be true but other superstitions come from 
religious traditions that few people believe in
or even remember. Knocking on wood is thought to come from 
the folklore of the ancient Indo-Europeans or possibly people who predated them who believed that trees were home
to various spirits. Touching a tree would invoke 
the protection or blessing of the spirit within. And somehow, this tradition survived long after 
belief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today
in countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan
religions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate
coincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear
the number 17 because the Roman numeral XVII
can be rearranged to form the word vixi, meaning my life had ended. Similarly, the word for the number four sounds almost identical 
to the word for death in Cantonese, as well as languages like Japanese and Korean that have borrowed 
Chinese numerals. And since the number one also
sounds like the word for must, the number fourteen sounds
like the phrase must die. That's a lot of numbers for elevators
and international hotels to avoid. And believe it or not, some superstitions actually make sense, or at least they did until we 
forgot their original purpose. For example, theater scenery used to
consist of large painted backdrops, raised and lowered by stagehands
who would whistle to signal each other. Absentminded whistles from other people
could cause an accident. But the taboo against whistling backstage
still exists today, long after the stagehands started using
radio headsets. Along the same lines, lighting three
cigarettes from the same match really could cause bad luck
if you were a soldier in a foxhole where keeping a match lit too long
could draw attention from an enemy sniper. Most smokers no longer have to worry
about snipers, but the superstition lives on. So why do people cling to these bits
of forgotten religions, coincidences, and outdated advice? Aren't they being totally irrational? Well, yes, but for many people, superstitions are based more
on cultural habit than conscious belief. After all, no one is born knowing to avoid
walking under ladders or whistling indoors, but if you grow up being told
by your family to avoid these things, chances are they'll make 
you uncomfortable, even after you logically understand
that nothing bad will happen. And since doing something like knocking
on wood doesn't require much effort, following the superstition is often
easier than consciously resisting it. Besides, superstitions 
often do seem to work. Maybe you remember hitting a home run
while wearing your lucky socks. This is just our psychological 
bias at work. You're far less likely to remember 
all the times you struck out while wearing the same socks. But believing that they work
could actually make you play better by giving you the illusion of having
greater control over events. So in situations where that confidence
can make a difference, like sports, those crazy superstitions might not
be so crazy after all.

belief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today
in countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan
religions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate
coincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear
the number 17 because the Roman numeral XVII
can be rearranged to form the word vixi, meaning my life had ended. Similarly, the word for the number four sounds almost identical 
to the word for death in Cantonese, as well as languages like Japanese and Korean that have borrowed 
Chinese numerals. And since the number one also
sounds like the word for must, the number fourteen sounds
like the phrase must die. That's a lot of numbers for elevators
and international hotels to avoid. And believe it or not, some superstitions actually make sense, or at least they did until we 
forgot their original purpose. For example, theater scenery used to
consist of large painted backdrops, raised and lowered by stagehands
who would whistle to signal each other. Absentminded whistles from other people
could cause an accident. But the taboo against whistling backstage
still exists today, long after the stagehands started using
radio headsets. Along the same lines, lighting three
cigarettes from the same match really could cause bad luck
if you were a soldier in a foxhole where keeping a match lit too long
could draw attention from an enemy sniper. Most smokers no longer have to worry
about snipers, but the superstition lives on. So why do people cling to these bits
of forgotten religions, coincidences, and outdated advice? Aren't they being totally irrational? Well, yes, but for many people, superstitions are based more
on cultural habit than conscious belief. After all, no one is born knowing to avoid
walking under ladders or whistling indoors, but if you grow up being told
by your family to avoid these things, chances are they'll make 
you uncomfortable, even after you logically understand
that nothing bad will happen. And since doing something like knocking
on wood doesn't require much effort, following the superstition is often
easier than consciously resisting it. Besides, superstitions 
often do seem to work. Maybe you remember hitting a home run
while wearing your lucky socks. This is just our psychological 
bias at work. You're far less likely to remember 
all the times you struck out while wearing the same socks. But believing that they work
could actually make you play better by giving you the illusion of having
greater control over events. So in situations where that confidence
can make a difference, like sports, those crazy superstitions might not
be so crazy after all.

**Transcript**:
Are you afraid of black cats? Would you open an umbrella indoors? And how do you feel about 
the number thirteen? Whether or not you believe in them, you're probably familiar with a few
of these superstitions. So how did it happen that people
all over the world knock on wood, or avoid stepping on sidewalk cracks? Well, although they have no basis
in science, many of these weirdly specific beliefs
and practices do have equally weird
and specific origins. Because they involve supernatural causes, it's no surprise that many superstitions
are based in religion. For example. the number thirteen was
associated with the biblical Last Supper, where Jesus Christ dined 
with his twelve disciples just before being arrested and crucified. The resulting idea that having thirteen
people at a table was bad luck eventually expanded into thirteen
being an unlucky number in general. Now, this fear of the number thirteen,
called triskaidekaphobia, is so common that many buildings around 
the world skip the thirteenth floor, with the numbers going straight from
twelve to fourteen. Of course, many people consider
the story of the Last Supper to be true but other superstitions come from 
religious traditions that few people believe in
or even remember. Knocking on wood is thought to come from 
the folklore of the ancient Indo-Europeans or possibly people who predated them who believed that trees were home
to various spirits. Touching a tree would invoke 
the protection or blessing of the spirit within. And somehow, this tradition survived long after 
belief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today
in countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan
religions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate
coincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1963, a high school teacher changed the way
the world looked at "The Wizard of Oz." His name was Henry Littlefield, and he was teaching 
an American history class. He'd made it to the late 19th century,
a time called The Gilded Age, but he was struggling to keep
his class interested in the complex social and economic
issues of the time. Then one night, while he was reading "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
to his daughters, he had an idea. In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver
to the gold standard to put more money in circulation and make it easier for farmers to borrow. In the book, Dorothy walked to
the Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road in her silver shoes. The movie's ruby red slippers 
started out as silver. Silver and gold on the road to prosperity. L. Frank Baum had published
the book in 1900 at the height of The Gilded Age, and the analogy didn't seem
out of the question. No one else had seen these connections, but that didn't deter Littlefield. He taught his class about The Gilded Age
using the book, and soon he and his students were
finding more connections. For instance, in the late 1890s, the U.S. had recently recovered
from the Civil War and integrated vast new territories, bringing an era of prosperity for some. But while industry and finance
in the North and East prospered, farmers across the South
and Midwest struggled. This led to the Populist movement, uniting farmers and workers against
urban elites. By 1896, the movement had grown
into the People's Party, and its support of Democrat
Williams Jennings Bryan put him in reach of the presidency. Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield, Dorothy is a typical American girl whose hard life in Kansas is literally
turned upside down by powerful forces outside her control. The munchkins are the common people
oppressed by the Witch of the East, banks and monopolies. The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually
quite resourceful, the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker
dehumanized by factory labor, and the Cowardly Lion 
is William Jennings Bryan who could be an influential figure
if only he were brave enough to adopt the Populist's radical program. Together, they travel along
a golden yellow road towards a grand city whose ruler's power
turns out to be built on illusions. Littlefield published some of these
observations in an essay. His claim that this fantasy was actually
a subversive critique of American capitalism appealed
to many people in 1960s. Other scholars took up the theme, and the proposed analogies
and connections multiplied. They suggested that Dorothy's dog Toto represented the teetotalers
of the prohibition party. Oz was clearly the abbreviation
for ounces, an important unit in the silver debate. The list goes on. By the 1980s, this understanding
of the book was accepted so widely that several American history textbooks mentioned it in discussions of
late 19th century politics. But is the theory right? L. Frank Baum's introduction claims the 
book is just an innocent children's story. Could he have been deliberately
throwing people off the trail? And is it fair to second guess
him so many decades later? There's no definitive answer, which is part of why authorial intent is a complex, tangled, fun question
to unravel. And some recent scholars have interpreted
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" in the opposite way as Littlefield. They claim it's a celebration of the 
new urban consumer culture. Historian William Leach argued that
the dazzling Emerald City of Oz was meant to acclimate people
to the shiny, new America. In the end, all we know
for sure is that Baum, inspired by European folk legends, had set out to create one
for American children. And whether or not he intended
any hidden meanings, its continuing relevance suggests
he succeeded in creating a fairytale
America can call its own.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about the Tin Woodman specifically.

Since there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most similar in terms of question intent and content. 

A more similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which asks about the representation of the Cowardly Lion, another character from "The Wizard of Oz". However, Question 3 is more similar in terms of the category of the character (the Scarecrow is also a character that represents a certain group of people, similar to the Tin Woodman).

However, another generated MCQ, Question 7, has an option C that states "William Jennings Bryan" was represented by the Cowardly Lion, and in the passage it is also mentioned that "The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually quite resourceful, the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker dehumanized by factory labor". 

But among all the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, which is to ask about the representation of a specific character from "The Wizard of Oz".

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1963, a high school teacher changed the way
the world looked at "The Wizard of Oz." His name was Henry Littlefield, and he was teaching 
an American history class. He'd made it to the late 19th century,
a time called The Gilded Age, but he was struggling to keep
his class interested in the complex social and economic
issues of the time. Then one night, while he was reading "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
to his daughters, he had an idea. In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver
to the gold standard to put more money in circulation and make it easier for farmers to borrow. In the book, Dorothy walked to
the Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road in her silver shoes. The movie's ruby red slippers 
started out as silver. Silver and gold on the road to prosperity. L. Frank Baum had published
the book in 1900 at the height of The Gilded Age, and the analogy didn't seem
out of the question. No one else had seen these connections, but that didn't deter Littlefield. He taught his class about The Gilded Age
using the book, and soon he and his students were
finding more connections. For instance, in the late 1890s, the U.S. had recently recovered
from the Civil War and integrated vast new territories, bringing an era of prosperity for some. But while industry and finance
in the North and East prospered, farmers across the South
and Midwest struggled. This led to the Populist movement, uniting farmers and workers against
urban elites. By 1896, the movement had grown
into the People's Party, and its support of Democrat
Williams Jennings Bryan put him in reach of the presidency. Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield, Dorothy is a typical American girl whose hard life in Kansas is literally
turned upside down by powerful forces outside her control. The munchkins are the common people
oppressed by the Witch of the East, banks and monopolies. The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the author of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 1 mentions L. Frank Baum as an option, but it asks about the high school teacher who changed the way the world looked at "The Wizard of Oz."

A more relevant generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the author or the book, I would suggest Question 5 or Question 9. However, these questions are not about the author's identity but rather about the interpretation of the book.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but only because it mentions L. Frank Baum as an option, not because the question is similar.

**Transcript**:
One foggy morning in 1884, the British steamer "Rumney" crashed
into the French ship "Frigorifique." Seeing their ship filling with water, the French crew climbed 
aboard the "Rumney." But as they sailed towards 
the nearest port, a silent form suddenly emerged
from the fog: the abandoned "Frigorifique." It was too late to turn, and the impact was enough 
to sink the "Rumney." As the sailors scrambled 
into the lifeboats, the empty "Frigorifique"
sailed back into the fog, having seemingly taken its revenge. In reality, the French sailors had left
the engines running, and the "Frigorifique" sailed in a circle
before striking the "Rumney" and finally sinking. But its story became one of the many tales
of ghost ships, unmanned vessels that apparently
sail themselves. And although they've influenced
works like "Dracula" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," crewless ships aren't the product
of ghostly spirits, just physics at work. One of the most famous ghost ships
was the "Mary Celeste" found sailing the Atlantic in 1872
with no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo
and a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits 
were two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces
a certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts
an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid
that's been displaced. This phenomenon is called
Archimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than 
the downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when 
they're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water
larger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull
would increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the "Mary Celeste's" crew feared
when they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account 
for fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point
of equilibrium, when it reached 
the same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water
wasn't enough to sink the ship and the "Mary Celeste"
was found a few days later while the unfortunate crew 
never made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale 
of "A. Ernest Mills," a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to 
the sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later,
it was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's
heavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull
made the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity

**Transcript**:
One foggy morning in 1884, the British steamer "Rumney" crashed
into the French ship "Frigorifique." Seeing their ship filling with water, the French crew climbed 
aboard the "Rumney." But as they sailed towards 
the nearest port, a silent form suddenly emerged
from the fog: the abandoned "Frigorifique." It was too late to turn, and the impact was enough 
to sink the "Rumney." As the sailors scrambled 
into the lifeboats, the empty "Frigorifique"
sailed back into the fog, having seemingly taken its revenge. In reality, the French sailors had left
the engines running, and the "Frigorifique" sailed in a circle
before striking the "Rumney" and finally sinking. But its story became one of the many tales
of ghost ships, unmanned vessels that apparently
sail themselves. And although they've influenced
works like "Dracula" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," crewless ships aren't the product
of ghostly spirits, just physics at work. One of the most famous ghost ships
was the "Mary Celeste" found sailing the Atlantic in 1872
with no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo
and a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits 
were two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces
a certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts
an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid
that's been displaced. This phenomenon is called
Archimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than 
the downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when 
they're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water
larger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull
would increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the "Mary Celeste's" crew feared
when they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account 
for fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point
of equilibrium, when it reached 
the same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water
wasn't enough to sink the ship and the "Mary Celeste"
was found a few days later while the unfortunate crew 
never made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale 
of "A. Ernest Mills," a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to 
the sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later,
it was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's
heavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull
made the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity 
became less than the buoyant force and the ship floated back to the surface. But how do we explain the most
enduring aspect of ghost ship legends: multiple sightings of the same ships 
hundreds of miles and several years apart? The answer lies in ocean currents, which are like invisible rivers flowing
through the ocean. Factors, like temperature, salinity, wind, gravity, and the Coriolis effect from
the Earth's rotation create a complex system of water movement. That applies both at the ocean's surface
and deep below. Sailors have always known about currents, but their patterns weren't well known

with no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo
and a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits 
were two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces
a certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts
an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid
that's been displaced. This phenomenon is called
Archimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than 
the downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when 
they're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water
larger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull
would increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the "Mary Celeste's" crew feared
when they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account 
for fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point
of equilibrium, when it reached 
the same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water
wasn't enough to sink the ship and the "Mary Celeste"
was found a few days later while the unfortunate crew 
never made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale 
of "A. Ernest Mills," a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to 
the sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later,
it was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's
heavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull
made the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity 
became less than the buoyant force and the ship floated back to the surface. But how do we explain the most
enduring aspect of ghost ship legends: multiple sightings of the same ships 
hundreds of miles and several years apart? The answer lies in ocean currents, which are like invisible rivers flowing
through the ocean. Factors, like temperature, salinity, wind, gravity, and the Coriolis effect from
the Earth's rotation create a complex system of water movement. That applies both at the ocean's surface
and deep below. Sailors have always known about currents, but their patterns weren't well known
until recently. In fact, tracking abandoned ships was how
scientists determined the shape and speed of the Atlantic Gyre, the Gulf Stream, and related currents in the first place. Beginning in 1883, 
the U.S. Hydrographic Office began collecting monthly data
that included navigation hazards, like derelict ships, whose locations
were reported by passing vessels. So abandoned ships may not be moved
by ghost crews or supernatural curses, but they are a real 
and fascinating phenomenon born through the ocean and kept afloat by powerful, invisible,
scientifically studied forces.

**Transcript**:
In 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora
plunged parts of the world into darkness and marked a gloomy period that came 
to be known as The Year Without a Summer. So when Mary and Percy Shelley arrived
at the House of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva, their vacation was mostly spent indoors. For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge
to his literary companions: who could write the most chilling
ghost story? This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary. Over the next few months, she would craft
the story of “Frankenstein.” Popular depictions may evoke a green
and groaning figure, but that's not Mary Shelley's monster. In fact, in the book, Frankenstein
refers to the nameless monster's maker, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. So tense is the struggle between
creator and creature that the two have merged 
in our collective imagination. Before you read 
or reread the original text, there are several other things that 
are helpful to know about Frankenstein and how it came to assume 
its multiple meanings. The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's
futile quest to impart and sustain life. He constructs his monster
part by part from dead matter and electrifies it into conscious being. Upon completing the experiment, however,
he's horrified at the result and flees. But time and space aren't enough
to banish the abandoned monster, and the plot turns on a chilling chase
between the two. Shelley subtitled her 
fireside ghost story, "The Modern Prometheus." That's in reference to the Greek myth
of the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods
and gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock
and eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence
in the literature of the Romantic Period during the 18th century. Mary was a prominent Romantic, and shared the movement's appreciation for
nature, emotion, and the purity of art. Two years after Mary
released “Frankenstein,” Percy reimagined the plight
of Prometheus in his lyrical drama, "Prometheus Unbound." The Romantics used 
these mythical references to signal the purity of the ancient world
in contrast to modernity. They typically regarded science
with suspicion, and "Frankenstein" is one of the first
cautionary tales about artificial intelligence. For Shelley, the terror
was not supernatural, but born in a lab. In addition, gothic devices 
infuse the text. The gothic genre is characterized
by unease, eerie settings, the grotesque, and the fear of oblivion— all elements that can 
be seen in "Frankenstein." But this horror had roots 
in personal trauma, as well. The text is filled with references
to Shelley's own circumstances. Born in 1797, Mary was the child
of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were radical intellectual figures, and her mother's book,
"A Vindication of the Rights of Women," is a key feminist text. Tragically, she died as a result
of complications from Mary’s birth. Mary was haunted by her mother's death, and later experienced her own
problems with childbirth. She became pregnant following
her elopement with Percy at 16, but that baby died shortly after birth. Out of four more pregnancies,
only one of their children survived. Some critics have linked this tragedy
to the themes explored in "Frankenstein." Shelley depicts birth as both creative
and destructive, and the monster becomes a disfigured
mirror of the natural cycle of life. The monster, therefore, embodies
Dr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature in the quest for glory. This constitutes his fatal flaw, 
or hamartia. His god complex is most clear in the line, "Life and death appear to me ideal bounds
which I should first break through and pour a torrent of light
onto our dark world." Although he accomplishes
something awe-inspiring, he has played with fire at his own
ethical expense. And that decision echoes 
throughout the novel, which is full of references to fire
and imagery that contrasts light and dark. These moments suggest not only the spark
of Prometheus's fire, but the power of radical ideas to expose
darker areas of life.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of theme and relevance.

The ground truth MCQ is about Dr. Frankenstein's reaction to his monster, specifically why he flees from it. The closest generated MCQ in terms of theme is Question 7, which deals with the personal trauma experienced by Mary Shelley and how it is reflected in the themes of "Frankenstein." However, this question does not directly address Dr. Frankenstein's reaction to his monster.

Another possible match is Question 8, which deals with Dr. Frankenstein's fatal flaw, or his corruption of nature in the quest for glory. While this question does relate to Dr. Frankenstein's character and motivations, it does not specifically address his reaction to the monster.

Given the options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest in terms of theme and relevance.

fireside ghost story, "The Modern Prometheus." That's in reference to the Greek myth
of the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods
and gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock
and eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence
in the literature of the Romantic Period during the 18th century. Mary was a prominent Romantic, and shared the movement's appreciation for
nature, emotion, and the purity of art. Two years after Mary
released “Frankenstein,” Percy reimagined the plight
of Prometheus in his lyrical drama, "Prometheus Unbound." The Romantics used 
these mythical references to signal the purity of the ancient world
in contrast to modernity. They typically regarded science
with suspicion, and "Frankenstein" is one of the first
cautionary tales about artificial intelligence. For Shelley, the terror
was not supernatural, but born in a lab. In addition, gothic devices 
infuse the text. The gothic genre is characterized
by unease, eerie settings, the grotesque, and the fear of oblivion— all elements that can 
be seen in "Frankenstein." But this horror had roots 
in personal trauma, as well. The text is filled with references
to Shelley's own circumstances. Born in 1797, Mary was the child
of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were radical intellectual figures, and her mother's book,
"A Vindication of the Rights of Women," is a key feminist text. Tragically, she died as a result
of complications from Mary’s birth. Mary was haunted by her mother's death, and later experienced her own
problems with childbirth. She became pregnant following
her elopement with Percy at 16, but that baby died shortly after birth. Out of four more pregnancies,
only one of their children survived. Some critics have linked this tragedy
to the themes explored in "Frankenstein." Shelley depicts birth as both creative
and destructive, and the monster becomes a disfigured
mirror of the natural cycle of life. The monster, therefore, embodies
Dr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature in the quest for glory. This constitutes his fatal flaw, 
or hamartia. His god complex is most clear in the line, "Life and death appear to me ideal bounds
which I should first break through and pour a torrent of light
onto our dark world." Although he accomplishes
something awe-inspiring, he has played with fire at his own
ethical expense. And that decision echoes 
throughout the novel, which is full of references to fire
and imagery that contrasts light and dark. These moments suggest not only the spark
of Prometheus's fire, but the power of radical ideas to expose
darker areas of life.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What mythological figure is referenced in the subtitle of Mary Shelley's novel "Frankenstein"? 

Although the options in Question 4 do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. The correct answer in Question 4 (B. Prometheus) corresponds to the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ (A. Dr. Frankenstein, who is referred to as "The Modern Prometheus"). 

However, a more accurate match can be found in Question 3, if we consider the explanation provided for the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the subtitle "The Modern Prometheus," which refers to Dr. Frankenstein. Question 3 asks about the name of the monster's maker in Mary Shelley's novel "Frankenstein," which is Dr. Victor Frankenstein, also referred to as "The Modern Prometheus."

Considering the explanations and intent, I would argue that Question 3 is a more accurate match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora
plunged parts of the world into darkness and marked a gloomy period that came 
to be known as The Year Without a Summer. So when Mary and Percy Shelley arrived
at the House of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva, their vacation was mostly spent indoors. For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge
to his literary companions: who could write the most chilling
ghost story? This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary. Over the next few months, she would craft
the story of “Frankenstein.” Popular depictions may evoke a green
and groaning figure, but that's not Mary Shelley's monster. In fact, in the book, Frankenstein
refers to the nameless monster's maker, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. So tense is the struggle between
creator and creature that the two have merged 
in our collective imagination. Before you read 
or reread the original text, there are several other things that 
are helpful to know about Frankenstein and how it came to assume 
its multiple meanings. The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's
futile quest to impart and sustain life. He constructs his monster
part by part from dead matter and electrifies it into conscious being. Upon completing the experiment, however,
he's horrified at the result and flees. But time and space aren't enough
to banish the abandoned monster, and the plot turns on a chilling chase
between the two. Shelley subtitled her 
fireside ghost story, "The Modern Prometheus." That's in reference to the Greek myth
of the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods
and gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock
and eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: What mythological figure is referenced in the subtitle of Mary Shelley's novel "Frankenstein"? 

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the significance or representation of Prometheus in the novel.

A closer match would be a question that combines elements of Questions 4 and 9, as they both relate to the mythological figure of Prometheus and the themes of the novel.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 9 is the closest, as it deals with the imagery and themes related to Prometheus.

Created by logician Raymond Smullyan and popularized by his colleague
George Boolos, this riddle has been called the hardest
logic puzzle ever. You and your team have crash-landed
on an ancient planet. The only way off is to appease
its three alien overlords, Tee, Eff, and Arr, by giving them the correct artifacts. Unfortunately, you don't
know who is who. From an inscription, you learn that you
may ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord. Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time. But there's a problem. You've deciphered the language enough
to ask any question, but you don't know which of the two
words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no. How can you still figure out 
which alien is which? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,
but downright impossible. What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer
nor know if it's true? But it can be done. The key is to carefully formulate
our questions so that any answer 
yields useful information. First of all, we can get around
to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves
in the questions, and secondly, if we load each question
with a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not
won't actually matter. To see how that could work, imagine our question
is whether two plus two is four. Instead of posing it directly, we say, "If I asked you whether
two plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?" If 'ozo' means yes 
and the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, "ozo." But what if we ask Eff? Well, it would answer "ulu,"
or no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to 
our embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons. If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure. A double positive and a double negative
both result in a positive. Now, we can be sure that asking
either Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo'
if the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what 
each word actually means. Unfortunately, 
this doesn't help us with Arr. But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr. Then we can use the second to find out
whether its Tee or Eff. And once we know that, we can ask it to identify 
one of the others. So let's begin. Ask the alien in the middle, "If I asked you whether the overlord on
my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?" If the reply is 'ozo,' 
there are two possibilities. You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined
isn't Arr and ask, "If I asked 'are you Eff?' 
would you answer 'ozo'?" Since you don't have to worry about
the random possibility, either answer will 
establish its identity. Now that you know whether its
answers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center
overlord is Arr. The process of elimination will identify
the remaining one. The satisfied overlords help you
repair your ship and you prepare for takeoff. Allowed one final question, you ask
Tee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers "ozo." Too bad you still don't know 
what that means.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What are you trying to do to solve the puzzle?
Options: A. Trick the aliens into repairing your ship, B. Escape from the aliens by finding the correct route to your ship, C. Learn the correct identity of each of the three aliens
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: Who created the logic puzzle mentioned in the transcript? Options: A. George Boolos, B. Raymond Smullyan, C. Tee, the alien overlord, D. An unknown logician Correct Option: None
Question 2: What is the primary challenge in solving the logic puzzle? Options: A. Not knowing the correct order of questions, B. Not understanding the language of the alien overlords, C. Not knowing which alien overlord is which and what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean, D. Not being able to ask enough questions Correct Option: None
Question 3: What is the key to solving the logic puzzle? Options: A. Asking direct questions to the alien overlords, B. Carefully formulating questions to yield useful information, C. Ignoring the answers of the alien overlords, D. Focusing on the language barrier Correct Option: None
Question 4: How does including the words 'ozo' and 'ulu' in the questions help solve the puzzle? Options: A. It confuses the alien overlords, causing them to reveal their identities, B. It allows the questioner to understand the meaning of the words, C. It eliminates the need to know what the words mean, D. It has no effect on the puzzle Correct Option: None
Question 5: What is the purpose of adding a hypothetical condition to the questions? Options: A. To confuse the alien overlords, B. To make the questions more direct, C. To ensure the answers are always true, D. To make the truthfulness of the answers irrelevant Correct Option: None
Question 6: What is the result of asking a question with a hypothetical condition to Tee or Eff? Options: A. The answer will always be 'ozo', B. The answer will always be 'ulu', C. The answer will be 'ozo' if the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false, D. The answer will be random Correct Option: None
Question 7: What is the purpose of the first question asked to the alien in the middle? Options: A. To identify the alien overlord on the left, B. To determine whether the alien overlord on the right is Arr, C. To identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr, D. To ask a random question Correct Option: None
Question 8: What is the next step after determining which alien overlord is not Arr? Options: A. Ask the same alien whether the center overlord is Arr, B. Ask the same alien whether it is Tee or Eff, C. Ask the alien on the left whether it is Arr, D. Ask the alien on the right whether it is Tee Correct Option: None
Question 9: What is the final step in solving the puzzle? Options: A. Ask the same alien whether the center overlord is Arr, B. Ask Tee if it's a long way to Earth, C. Ask Eff whether it is lying, D. Ask Arr a random question Correct Option: None
Question 10: What is the outcome of asking Tee if it's a long way to Earth? Options: A. Tee answers 'ozo', and the meaning is clear, B. Tee answers 'ulu', and the meaning is clear, C. Tee answers 'ozo', but the meaning is still unknown, D. Tee refuses to answer Correct Option: None


Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the main objective of solving the puzzle, which is to learn the correct identity of each of the three aliens.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7: "What is the purpose of the first question asked to the alien in the middle?" has an option C: "To identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr." This option is related to identifying the aliens, but it's not the main objective of the puzzle.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2: "What is the primary challenge in solving the logic puzzle?" This question is related to the puzzle's objective, and option C: "Not knowing which alien overlord is which and what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean" is closely related to the main objective of identifying the aliens.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

Please note that this is an approximation, as none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

may ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord. Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time. But there's a problem. You've deciphered the language enough
to ask any question, but you don't know which of the two
words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no. How can you still figure out 
which alien is which? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,
but downright impossible. What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer
nor know if it's true? But it can be done. The key is to carefully formulate
our questions so that any answer 
yields useful information. First of all, we can get around
to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves
in the questions, and secondly, if we load each question
with a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not
won't actually matter. To see how that could work, imagine our question
is whether two plus two is four. Instead of posing it directly, we say, "If I asked you whether
two plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?" If 'ozo' means yes 
and the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, "ozo." But what if we ask Eff? Well, it would answer "ulu,"
or no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to 
our embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons. If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure. A double positive and a double negative
both result in a positive. Now, we can be sure that asking
either Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo'
if the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what 
each word actually means. Unfortunately, 
this doesn't help us with Arr. But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr. Then we can use the second to find out
whether its Tee or Eff. And once we know that, we can ask it to identify 
one of the others. So let's begin. Ask the alien in the middle, "If I asked you whether the overlord on
my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?" If the reply is 'ozo,' 
there are two possibilities. You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined
isn't Arr and ask, "If I asked 'are you Eff?' 
would you answer 'ozo'?" Since you don't have to worry about
the random possibility, either answer will 
establish its identity. Now that you know whether its
answers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center
overlord is Arr. The process of elimination will identify
the remaining one. The satisfied overlords help you
repair your ship and you prepare for takeoff. Allowed one final question, you ask
Tee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers "ozo." Too bad you still don't know 
what that means.

Created by logician Raymond Smullyan and popularized by his colleague

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the combination of hypothetical conditions that does NOT yield a positive, which is related to the concept of logical structure and double positives and negatives.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most similar, as it deals with the result of asking a question with a hypothetical condition to Tee or Eff. Although it does not directly ask about the combination of hypothetical conditions, it touches on the idea of how hypothetical conditions affect the answers.

However, since the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that accurately reflects the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but with a note that it is not a direct match.

Index: 6 (with a note that it is not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
Sometime in the early 1750s, a 22-year-old man named
Benjamin Banneker sat industriously carving cogs
and gears out of wood. He pieced the parts together to create the complex inner working
of a striking clock that would, hopefully, 
chime every hour. All he had to help him was 
a pocket watch for inspiration and his own calculations. And yet, his careful engineering worked. Striking clocks had already been
around for hundreds of years, but Banneker's may have been
the first created in America, and it drew fascinated visitors from
across the country. In a show of his brilliance, the clock continued to chime
for the rest of Banneker's life. Born in 1731 to freed slaves
on a farm in Baltimore, Maryland, from his earliest days, the young Banneker was obsessed
with math and science. And his appetite for knowledge only grew
as he taught himself astronomy, mathematics, engineering, and the study of the natural world. As an adult, he used astronomy
to accurately predict lunar and solar events, like the solar eclipse of 1789, and even applied his mathematical skills
to land use planning. These talents caught the eye of a local
Baltimore businessman, Andrew Ellicott, who was also the Surveyor General
of the United States. Recognizing Banneker's skills in 1791, Ellicott appointed him as an assistant
to work on a prestigious new project, planning the layout 
of the nation's capitol. Meanwhile, Banneker turned 
his brilliant mind to farming. He used his scientific expertise
to pioneer new agricultural methods on his family's tobacco farm. His fascination with the natural world also led to a study on the plague
life cycle of locusts. Then in 1792, Banneker 
began publishing almanacs. These provided detailed annual information
on moon and sun cycles, weather forecasts, and planting and tidal time tables. Banneker sent a handwritten copy
of his first almanac to Virginia's Secretary of State
Thomas Jefferson. This was a decade before Jefferson
became president. Banneker included a letter imploring
Jefferson to "embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd 
and false ideas and opinions" that caused prejudice 
against black people. Jefferson read the almanac and wrote
back in praise of Banneker's work. Banneker's correspondence with 
the future president is now considered to be one of the first
documented examples of a civil rights 
protest letter in America. For the rest of his life,
he fought for this cause, sharing his opposition to slavery
through his writing. In 1806 at the age of 75, Banneker died after a lifetime
of study and activism. On the day of his funeral,
his house mysteriously burned down, and the majority of his life's work, including his striking clock, 
was destroyed. But still, his legacy lives on.

**Transcript**:
Sometime in the early 1750s, a 22-year-old man named
Benjamin Banneker sat industriously carving cogs
and gears out of wood. He pieced the parts together to create the complex inner working
of a striking clock that would, hopefully, 
chime every hour. All he had to help him was 
a pocket watch for inspiration and his own calculations. And yet, his careful engineering worked. Striking clocks had already been
around for hundreds of years, but Banneker's may have been
the first created in America, and it drew fascinated visitors from
across the country. In a show of his brilliance, the clock continued to chime
for the rest of Banneker's life. Born in 1731 to freed slaves
on a farm in Baltimore, Maryland, from his earliest days, the young Banneker was obsessed
with math and science. And his appetite for knowledge only grew
as he taught himself astronomy, mathematics, engineering, and the study of the natural world. As an adult, he used astronomy
to accurately predict lunar and solar events, like the solar eclipse of 1789, and even applied his mathematical skills
to land use planning. These talents caught the eye of a local
Baltimore businessman, Andrew Ellicott, who was also the Surveyor General
of the United States. Recognizing Banneker's skills in 1791, Ellicott appointed him as an assistant
to work on a prestigious new project, planning the layout 
of the nation's capitol. Meanwhile, Banneker turned 
his brilliant mind to farming. He used his scientific expertise
to pioneer new agricultural methods on his family's tobacco farm. His fascination with the natural world also led to a study on the plague
life cycle of locusts. Then in 1792, Banneker 
began publishing almanacs. These provided detailed annual information
on moon and sun cycles, weather forecasts, and planting and tidal time tables. Banneker sent a handwritten copy
of his first almanac to Virginia's Secretary of State
Thomas Jefferson. This was a decade before Jefferson
became president. Banneker included a letter imploring
Jefferson to "embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd 
and false ideas and opinions" that caused prejudice 
against black people. Jefferson read the almanac and wrote
back in praise of Banneker's work. Banneker's correspondence with 
the future president is now considered to be one of the first
documented examples of a civil rights 
protest letter in America. For the rest of his life,
he fought for this cause, sharing his opposition to slavery
through his writing. In 1806 at the age of 75, Banneker died after a lifetime
of study and activism. On the day of his funeral,
his house mysteriously burned down, and the majority of his life's work, including his striking clock, 
was destroyed. But still, his legacy lives on.

**Transcript**:
Humans have done a pretty good job of exploring
the Earth thus far, climbing mountains and crossing continents and planting our flags
all over the place in the name of science. But one part of the world that has remained pretty
mysterious to us also happens to cover more than 70% of its surface: the ocean. Yes , we’ve sailed across it plenty of times.
And drilled for oil in it. And managed to create reality shows about fishing in it. But, from glowing oceans to massive deep-sea
creatures, and underwater ecosystems with thousands of undiscovered, basically-alien
species -- we still have a lot to learn about it. Probably more than any place on Earth, the
ocean is full of fascinating stuff that we just don’t know. Not yet. [Music Playing] Number One: What’s the ocean floor like? Fact is, we still don’t know exactly what
the ocean floor looks like in most places. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
says that 95% of the ocean's bottom remains unseen by humans. As a result, we have a way better picture of the surfaces of other planets than we do of most of the seafloor. In 2014, a team of scientists created a map
of the seafloor using data from satellites equipped with special sensors called radar
altimeters. These instruments could precisely measure the distance from the satellite to the surface of the ocean below. Essentially, any large mountains or canyons
on the ocean floor have a slight gravitational effect on the ocean surface, creating bumps and dips, respectively. These variations are of course too subtle to be detected by human eyes, but they can be measured by these ultra-precise satellite altimeters
-- and, after adjusting for the effect of waves and tides, tell scientists what’s
on the seafloor. This map spans the entire ocean floor, which is awesome, and we’re all glad that it exists, but it only has a resolution of about 5 kilometers, which is pretty low. By comparison, most of the surface of Mars, Venus, and the Moon have been mapped to resolutions of 100 meters or less. So, if we want to know what’s going on down there and really explore the ocean, detecting life, specific mineral formations, or wrecks, we’re gonna need a better map. Number Two: What’s under the seafloor? OK, probably thinking that you know what’s
down there: rock. Yes. But not just rock. In 2015, scientists reported that they had
drilled down about 2 and a half kilometers below the seafloor off the coast of Japan,
and discovered living microbes. There were only about 10 to 10,000 microorganisms
in a cubic centimeter of sediment that they studied, compared to like billions that you’d
find in the same amount of dirt from your garden. But still: There's life down there, even
in the intense heat and pressure many kilometers below where the ocean stops. And the genomes of these under-sea microbes
showed that they were actually more similar to the kind you’d find in forest soil, rather
than the ones in seafloor sediments. So it’s possible that these microbes are
descendants of terrestrial ones from 20 million years ago, that just adapted when their habitat
began to get buried way beneath the ocean. So, who knows what other kinds of life could
exist in deep marine sediments, or what they could tell us about what life on Earth used to be like? Number Three: Brine pools. We’ve all seen lakes and rivers on land,
but what about lakes that are … underwater? Sounds a little bit unreal, like maybe it’s from a Sponge Bob episode but these features actually exist -- pockets of seawater that have a different
composition than the surrounding ocean: because they’re super salty. They’re known as brine pools, and they seem
to have formed when layers of salt from evaporated oceans millions of years ago got buried under
layers of sediment. Seawater can reach these deposits and mix
with the salt, forming a dense brine that flows out of the seafloor, sometimes filled
with oils or methane gas. Some brine pools, like those found deep in
the Gulf of Mexico, are four times as salty as the ocean water around it. And the brine is so dense that submersibles
can even “float” on top of it, like a boat on a lake. All of this salt makes brine pools lethal
to larger animals. But colonies of halophilic -- or salt-loving
-- microorganisms can flourish there, usually in much higher concentrations than the nearby
normal seawater. Some pools are even lined with mussels that
have symbiotic bacteria in their gills, which use the methane in the brine to make energy
for the mussels. But there’s a ton that we don’t know about
these weird underwater salt lakes -- like how brine pools can be so different from each
other -- and why some have mussels and others don’t -- and even how many there are! Number Four: Milky seas. Also known as mareel, this is a
phenomenon in which thousands of square kilometers of the ocean’s surface glow a brilliant
whitish-blue. It lasts for such a short time, and there
have been so few recorded sightings, that these glowing seas were thought to be a myth
made up by crazy sailors… … until 2005 -- when a group of researchers
was studying satellite pictures of a swath of the Indian Ocean from 1995. These pictures showed an area of about 15,000 kilometers-square, around the size of Connecticut, glowing for 3 nights. It was the first scientific evidence of the
phenomenon, but the glowing waters are still not very well understood. Some have suggested that the glow is caused by a mass of tiny dinoflagellates called Noctiluca scintillans known as “sea sparkles” for the way they glow when disturbed. These protists are what cause the picturesque
glittering waves along coastlines in some parts of the world. But the 2005 study found that it was “unlikely,
if not impossible” that the short-lived glowing of dinoflagellates was what scientists had been seeing from space. The prevailing theory these days is that milky
seas are caused by massive colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that are growing on top of an algal
bloom. But we’re still not sure how or why these
ephemeral masses of bacteria gather, glow, and disappear. Number Five: The 52 hertz whale. You’d think we would know a lot about whales. I mean, they’re big, and we have their skeletons,
and we can observe their migratory patterns. But one thing we still have a lot more to learn about is their songs -- from why some whales make them, to how an animal without vocal
cords … or lips … manages to make song-like sounds. And then there’s this question -- what whale
is producing the 52 hertz song, and why? This whale song was first noted by a technician
on December 7th, 1992 in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. It sounded like a blue whale, but blue whale
cries usually are somewhere between 15 and 20 hertz in pitch. So, blue whales in the Pacific typically sound
like this: [Blue Whale Cry Playing] But this whale song, played at the same speed,
sounded like this: [52 Hertz Song Playing] This high-pitch noise seemed to be unique
to one animal -- a whale that became known as 52 Blue. This raises a lot of questions, and we have
to know more about whales to be able to answer some of them, like, why does this one whale sound different? And can others even hear it? And if they can hear it, do they understand? Some people latched onto to the idea that
52 Blue is a lonely whale crying out to others that might not hear it or wouldn’t call
back. But several scientists have rejected this
lonely narrative, and think that other whales may be able to understand its call, even if
they can’t make that call themselves. Also, 52 blue seems to migrate independently
from any other whales. But its migratory patterns do look kind
of like those of blue whales -- scientists have been tracking it up and down the North
Pacific from Alaska to Mexico for years now. So some researchers think it might have some
malformation that has changed how it sings, or maybe it’s even a hybrid between a blue
whale and another species. Whether or not it’s a lonely whale, 52 Blue
is an oddity that people seem to love. Number Six: Upsweep. Now, ocean sounds are practically their own
field of study, NOAA has been monitoring acoustics in the ocean for decades now. Instead of microphones, which are used to
collect sound in air, NOAA uses hydrophones to record underwater sounds. Mostly, these hydrophones are used to listen
to the ambient sound of the ocean, to see how humans might interfere with it, and to listen for things like earthquakes and whale calls. And sometimes, they record things that are
hard to explain, at least for a while. In 1997, for example, there was what was known
as The Bloop, an extremely loud, low-frequency sound heard by hydrophones some 5,000 kilometers
apart. Oceanographers recently determined that it
was the result of an icequake -- the cracking and collapse of glaciers into the ocean, in
this case on the coast of Antarctica. But there’s another mystery sound from the
ocean, known as Upsweep. Recorded in August 1991, it sounds like a
repeating “boop” that picks up at the end -- sweeping up -- kind of like the “red
alert” sound effect you hear on spaceships in sci-fi movies. But instead of trying to describe it, I could just play it for you. [Boop Playing] Since 1991, this sound has been heard regularly
in the Pacific Ocean, and it seems to be seasonal, usually becoming more common in spring and
fall. Researchers have tracked the sound to a part
of the Pacific that has lots of volcanic and seismic activity, which seem to be important
clues. But according to NOAA, “the origin of the
sound is unresolved.” Number Seven: Why are deep-sea creatures so
huge? From the Kraken to sea dragons, all of our
favorite mythical sea monsters are gigantic. And the fact is, in real life, many deep-sea
creatures are unusually huge. This phenomenon is called deep-sea gigantism. But what drives it is … you guessed it!
… unknown! In the deep sea, and especially near the polar
oceans, some animals seem to get really huge -- like colossal squids, giant isopods, and
Japanese spider crabs. Scientists aren’t sure why, but they do have some guesses. There’s Bergmann’s Rule, for example,
which suggests that temperature may influence gigantism. This might be because larger animals have
less surface area relative to volume, so they radiate less heat based on their mass and
stay warmer in colder climates. And then there’s Klieber’s Law,
which states that more massive animals generally have lower metabolic rates -- and therefore
need less high-quality food --- to survive. Still other theories suggest that gigantism
may help organisms resist increased pressure of the deep sea. But we don’t really have conclusive biological
reasons why these giant creatures exist. So, the ocean is just full o’ mysteries,
maybe because it’s so huge and dark and deep. But just so you know that we’re not hyping
you -- we’re not saying that these 7 topics are things that Science Can’t Explain. Instead, you should just think of them as reminders of how much we still have to learn about the ocean. As our technology improves, and our access
to the ocean takes us to new depths, we’ll be able to see and hear and sample more stuff than we ever have before. So in time, these puzzles will be solved,
and new creatures will be discovered, and our understanding of our planet, and the life
on it, will be that much … deeper. Thank you for watching this SciShow List Show, and thanks especially to all of our patrons on Patreon who make this show possible. If you want to help us keep making shows like this, you can go to patreon.com/scishow­. And

all over the place in the name of science. But one part of the world that has remained pretty
mysterious to us also happens to cover more than 70% of its surface: the ocean. Yes , we’ve sailed across it plenty of times.
And drilled for oil in it. And managed to create reality shows about fishing in it. But, from glowing oceans to massive deep-sea
creatures, and underwater ecosystems with thousands of undiscovered, basically-alien
species -- we still have a lot to learn about it. Probably more than any place on Earth, the
ocean is full of fascinating stuff that we just don’t know. Not yet. [Music Playing] Number One: What’s the ocean floor like? Fact is, we still don’t know exactly what
the ocean floor looks like in most places. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
says that 95% of the ocean's bottom remains unseen by humans. As a result, we have a way better picture of the surfaces of other planets than we do of most of the seafloor. In 2014, a team of scientists created a map
of the seafloor using data from satellites equipped with special sensors called radar
altimeters. These instruments could precisely measure the distance from the satellite to the surface of the ocean below. Essentially, any large mountains or canyons
on the ocean floor have a slight gravitational effect on the ocean surface, creating bumps and dips, respectively. These variations are of course too subtle to be detected by human eyes, but they can be measured by these ultra-precise satellite altimeters
-- and, after adjusting for the effect of waves and tides, tell scientists what’s
on the seafloor. This map spans the entire ocean floor, which is awesome, and we’re all glad that it exists, but it only has a resolution of about 5 kilometers, which is pretty low. By comparison, most of the surface of Mars, Venus, and the Moon have been mapped to resolutions of 100 meters or less. So, if we want to know what’s going on down there and really explore the ocean, detecting life, specific mineral formations, or wrecks, we’re gonna need a better map. Number Two: What’s under the seafloor? OK, probably thinking that you know what’s
down there: rock. Yes. But not just rock. In 2015, scientists reported that they had
drilled down about 2 and a half kilometers below the seafloor off the coast of Japan,
and discovered living microbes. There were only about 10 to 10,000 microorganisms
in a cubic centimeter of sediment that they studied, compared to like billions that you’d
find in the same amount of dirt from your garden. But still: There's life down there, even
in the intense heat and pressure many kilometers below where the ocean stops. And the genomes of these under-sea microbes
showed that they were actually more similar to the kind you’d find in forest soil, rather
than the ones in seafloor sediments. So it’s possible that these microbes are
descendants of terrestrial ones from 20 million years ago, that just adapted when their habitat
began to get buried way beneath the ocean. So, who knows what other kinds of life could
exist in deep marine sediments, or what they could tell us about what life on Earth used to be like? Number Three: Brine pools. We’ve all seen lakes and rivers on land,
but what about lakes that are … underwater? Sounds a little bit unreal, like maybe it’s from a Sponge Bob episode but these features actually exist -- pockets of seawater that have a different
composition than the surrounding ocean: because they’re super salty. They’re known as brine pools, and they seem
to have formed when layers of salt from evaporated oceans millions of years ago got buried under
layers of sediment. Seawater can reach these deposits and mix
with the salt, forming a dense brine that flows out of the seafloor, sometimes filled
with oils or methane gas. Some brine pools, like those found deep in
the Gulf of Mexico, are four times as salty as the ocean water around it. And the brine is so dense that submersibles
can even “float” on top of it, like a boat on a lake. All of this salt makes brine pools lethal
to larger animals. But colonies of halophilic -- or salt-loving
-- microorganisms can flourish there, usually in much higher concentrations than the nearby
normal seawater. Some pools are even lined with mussels that
have symbiotic bacteria in their gills, which use the methane in the brine to make energy
for the mussels. But there’s a ton that we don’t know about
these weird underwater salt lakes -- like how brine pools can be so different from each
other -- and why some have mussels and others don’t -- and even how many there are! Number Four: Milky seas. Also known as mareel, this is a
phenomenon in which thousands of square kilometers of the ocean’s surface glow a brilliant
whitish-blue. It lasts for such a short time, and there
have been so few recorded sightings, that these glowing seas were thought to be a myth
made up by crazy sailors… … until 2005 -- when a group of researchers
was studying satellite pictures of a swath of the Indian Ocean from 1995. These pictures showed an area of about 15,000 kilometers-square, around the size of Connecticut, glowing for 3 nights. It was the first scientific evidence of the
phenomenon, but the glowing waters are still not very well understood. Some have suggested that the glow is caused by a mass of tiny dinoflagellates called Noctiluca scintillans known as “sea sparkles” for the way they glow when disturbed. These protists are what cause the picturesque
glittering waves along coastlines in some parts of the world. But the 2005 study found that it was “unlikely,
if not impossible” that the short-lived glowing of dinoflagellates was what scientists had been seeing from space. The prevailing theory these days is that milky
seas are caused by massive colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that are growing on top of an algal
bloom. But we’re still not sure how or why these
ephemeral masses of bacteria gather, glow, and disappear. Number Five: The 52 hertz whale. You’d think we would know a lot about whales. I mean, they’re big, and we have their skeletons,
and we can observe their migratory patterns. But one thing we still have a lot more to learn about is their songs -- from why some whales make them, to how an animal without vocal
cords … or lips … manages to make song-like sounds. And then there’s this question -- what whale
is producing the 52 hertz song, and why? This whale song was first noted by a technician
on December 7th, 1992 in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. It sounded like a blue whale, but blue whale
cries usually are somewhere between 15 and 20 hertz in pitch. So, blue whales in the Pacific typically sound
like this: [Blue Whale Cry Playing] But this whale song, played at the same speed,
sounded like this: [52 Hertz Song Playing] This high-pitch noise seemed to be unique
to one animal -- a whale that became known as 52 Blue. This raises a lot of questions, and we have
to know more about whales to be able to answer some of them, like, why does this one whale sound different? And can others even hear it? And if they can hear it, do they understand? Some people latched onto to the idea that
52 Blue is a lonely whale crying out to others that might not hear it or wouldn’t call
back. But several scientists have rejected this
lonely narrative, and think that other whales may be able to understand its call, even if
they can’t make that call themselves. Also, 52 blue seems to migrate independently
from any other whales. But its migratory patterns do look kind
of like those of blue whales -- scientists have been tracking it up and down the North
Pacific from Alaska to Mexico for years now. So some researchers think it might have some
malformation that has changed how it sings, or maybe it’s even a hybrid between a blue
whale and another species. Whether or not it’s a lonely whale, 52 Blue
is an oddity that people seem to love. Number Six: Upsweep. Now, ocean sounds are practically their own
field of study, NOAA has been monitoring acoustics in the ocean for decades now. Instead of microphones, which are used to
collect sound in air, NOAA uses hydrophones to record underwater sounds. Mostly, these hydrophones are used to listen
to the ambient sound of the ocean, to see how humans might interfere with it, and to listen for things like earthquakes and whale calls. And sometimes, they record things that are
hard to explain, at least for a while. In 1997, for example, there was what was known
as The Bloop, an extremely loud, low-frequency sound heard by hydrophones some 5,000 kilometers
apart. Oceanographers recently determined that it
was the result of an icequake -- the cracking and collapse of glaciers into the ocean, in
this case on the coast of Antarctica. But there’s another mystery sound from the
ocean, known as Upsweep. Recorded in August 1991, it sounds like a
repeating “boop” that picks up at the end -- sweeping up -- kind of like the “red
alert” sound effect you hear on spaceships in sci-fi movies. But instead of trying to describe it, I could just play it for you. [Boop Playing] Since 1991, this sound has been heard regularly
in the Pacific Ocean, and it seems to be seasonal, usually becoming more common in spring and
fall. Researchers have tracked the sound to a part
of the Pacific that has lots of volcanic and seismic activity, which seem to be important
clues. But according to NOAA, “the origin of the
sound is unresolved.” Number Seven: Why are deep-sea creatures so
huge? From the Kraken to sea dragons, all of our
favorite mythical sea monsters are gigantic. And the fact is, in real life, many deep-sea
creatures are unusually huge. This phenomenon is called deep-sea gigantism. But what drives it is … you guessed it!
… unknown! In the deep sea, and especially near the polar
oceans, some animals seem to get really huge -- like colossal squids, giant isopods, and
Japanese spider crabs. Scientists aren’t sure why, but they do have some guesses. There’s Bergmann’s Rule, for example,
which suggests that temperature may influence gigantism. This might be because larger animals have
less surface area relative to volume, so they radiate less heat based on their mass and
stay warmer in colder climates. And then there’s Klieber’s Law,
which states that more massive animals generally have lower metabolic rates -- and therefore
need less high-quality food --- to survive. Still other theories suggest that gigantism
may help organisms resist increased pressure of the deep sea. But we don’t really have conclusive biological
reasons why these giant creatures exist. So, the ocean is just full o’ mysteries,
maybe because it’s so huge and dark and deep. But just so you know that we’re not hyping
you -- we’re not saying that these 7 topics are things that Science Can’t Explain. Instead, you should just think of them as reminders of how much we still have to learn about the ocean. As our technology improves, and our access
to the ocean takes us to new depths, we’ll be able to see and hear and sample more stuff than we ever have before. So in time, these puzzles will be solved,
and new creatures will be discovered, and our understanding of our planet, and the life
on it, will be that much … deeper. Thank you for watching this SciShow List Show, and thanks especially to all of our patrons on Patreon who make this show possible. If you want to help us keep making shows like this, you can go to patreon.com/scishow­. And

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're walking through a forest. Everything might seem quiet...but beneath
your feet is a flurry of conversation. All the plants around you are actually talking
to each other. The trees and the shrubs and the flowers are
passing information back and forth, with serious life and death consequences. So, how are they communicating? They’re using a giant network of fungi—one
so pervasive and powerful that some scientists have started comparing it to the Internet. They’re calling it the “Wood Wide Web.” I’m Anna, and this is Gross Science. The so-called Wood Wide Web is made up of
what are called “mycorrhizal fungi.” There are many different types of mycorrhizal
fungi, but generally these little guys will grow on the roots of plants and provide them
with water and nutrients—like nitrogen and phosphorus—in exchange for sugars from the
plant. While they’re incredibly thin, the threads
of the fungi can be up to 1000 times the length of a tree root. This allows the fungi to connect together
many different plants. Once connections are made, the fungi can act
almost like the neurons in our brain, transporting signals from plant to plant. And these networks are everywhere. It’s estimated that around 90% of land plants
are connected to some kind of mycorrhizal network. So, how can plants use these networks? Well, to begin with, they can help each other
out in times of stress. For example, during the fall months, when
paper birch trees lose their leaves and can’t produce sugar, Douglas-fir trees may shuttle
them nutrients through the fungal network. And in the summer, when paper birch trees
have lots of leaves, they send sugars to young Douglas-fir saplings growing in their shadows. Plants can also warn each other of danger. Douglas-fir trees connected by a fungal network
can alert their ponderosa pine neighbors if they’re attacked by budworms. In response, the neighboring ponderosa pine
trees will produce insect-repelling chemicals—even though they haven’t been directly exposed
to the insects themselves. Mycorrhizal fungi can also enable parental
care of among plants. Some adult trees will help out their younger
relatives by sending those seedlings more nutrients through the fungal network than
they send to strangers. The adults may even make more room for them
in the soil by reducing the number of their own roots. But not everyone is so generous. Much like our internet, things can sometimes
get a little nasty on the Wood Wide Web. Take Black Walnut trees, for example. They can spread poison through the network,
hindering the growth of their neighbors. And the fungi making up the network can be
just as tricky. Mycorrhizal fungi tend to pick favorites. They may share resources with one species
of tree, but bleed another species dry without giving anything back in return. The fungi may also judge a plant's health. If they think it’s too weak or sick, they
may not allow it to receive nutrients or danger signals from the network. Now, we’re only beginning to understand
how complex these relationships get. But imagine the possibilities for agriculture
and forestry. If we find out certain species share well
across the network, maybe we can plant them near each other to yield better harvests,
or grow healthier forests. So next time you’re walking through the
woods or the park don’t forget to thank the fungal web beneath your feet. Ew.

Imagine you're walking through a forest. Everything might seem quiet...but beneath
your feet is a flurry of conversation. All the plants around you are actually talking
to each other. The trees and the shrubs and the flowers are
passing information back and forth, with serious life and death consequences. So, how are they communicating? They’re using a giant network of fungi—one
so pervasive and powerful that some scientists have started comparing it to the Internet. They’re calling it the “Wood Wide Web.” I’m Anna, and this is Gross Science. The so-called Wood Wide Web is made up of
what are called “mycorrhizal fungi.” There are many different types of mycorrhizal
fungi, but generally these little guys will grow on the roots of plants and provide them
with water and nutrients—like nitrogen and phosphorus—in exchange for sugars from the
plant. While they’re incredibly thin, the threads
of the fungi can be up to 1000 times the length of a tree root. This allows the fungi to connect together
many different plants. Once connections are made, the fungi can act
almost like the neurons in our brain, transporting signals from plant to plant. And these networks are everywhere. It’s estimated that around 90% of land plants
are connected to some kind of mycorrhizal network. So, how can plants use these networks? Well, to begin with, they can help each other

**Transcript**:
Shall I ask for a show
of hands or a clapping of people in different generations? I'm interested in how many
are three to 12 years old. (Laughter) None, huh? (Laughter) All right. I'm going to talk about dinosaurs. Do you remember dinosaurs
when you were that age? (Applause) Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know. (Laughter) We're going to kind of go
in a different direction right now. I hope you all realize that. So I'll just give you my message up front: Try not to go extinct. (Laughter) That's it. (Laughter) People ask me a lot -- in fact, one of the most asked
questions I get is, why do children
like dinosaurs so much? What's the fascination? And I usually just say, "Well, dinosaurs were big, different and gone." They're all gone. Well that's not true, but we'll get to the goose in a minute. So that's sort of the theme: big, different and gone. The title of my talk: Shape-shifting Dinosaurs: The cause of a premature extinction. Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs. And there's lots of different shapes. Lots of different kinds. A long time ago, back in the early 1900s,
museums were out looking for dinosaurs. They went out and gathered them up. And this is an interesting story. Every museum wanted a little bigger
or better one than anybody else had. So if the museum in Toronto went out
and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one, then the museum in Ottawa
wanted a bigger one, and a better one. And that happened for all museums. So everyone was out looking
for all these bigger and better dinosaurs. And this was in the early 1900s. By about 1970, some scientists were sitting around
and they thought, "What in the world -- Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big. Where are all the little ones?" (Laughter) And they thought about it
and they even wrote papers about it: "Where are the little dinosaurs?" (Laughter) Well, go to a museum, you'll see, see how many baby dinosaurs there are. People assumed --
and this was actually a problem -- people assumed
that if they had little dinosaurs, if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
they'd be easy to identify. You'd have a big dinosaur
and a littler dinosaur. (Laughter) But all they had were big dinosaurs. And it comes down to a couple of things. First off, scientists have egos, and scientists like to name dinosaurs. They like to name anything. Everybody likes to have
their own animal that they named. (Laughter) And so every time they found something
that looked a little different, they named it something different. And what happened, of course, is we ended up with a whole
bunch of different dinosaurs. In 1975, a light went on in somebody's head. Dr. Peter Dodson
at the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do, which is different
than the way reptiles grow. And in fact, he used the cassowary as an example. And it's kind of cool --
if you look at the cassowary, or any of the birds
that have crests on their heads, they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow. Now think about that. They're basically retaining
their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny. So allometric cranial ontogeny
is relative skull growth. So you can see that if you actually found
one that was 80 percent grown and you didn't know that it was going
to grow up to a cassowary, you would think
they were two different animals. So this was a problem, and Peter Dodson pointed this out
using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus. And he showed that if you were to take
a baby and an adult and make an average
of what it should look like, if it grew in sort of a linear fashion, it would have a crest
about half the size of the adult. But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all. So this was interesting. So this is where people went astray again. I mean, if they'd have just taken that, taken Peter Dodson's work,
and gone on with that, then we would have a lot less
dinosaurs than we have. But scientists have egos;
they like to name things. And so they went on naming dinosaurs
because they were different. Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
is a young one or an older one. And that's by actually
cutting into their bones. But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
is hard to do, as you can imagine, because in museums, bones are precious. You go into a museum,
and they take really good care of them. They put them in foam, little containers. They're very well taken care of. They don't like it if you come in
and want to saw them open and look inside. (Laughter) So they don't normally let you do that. (Laughter) But I have a museum
and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open. So that's what I do. (Applause) So if you cut open a little dinosaur, it's very spongy inside, like A. And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
it's very massive. You can tell it's mature bone. So it's real easy to tell them apart. So what I want to do is show you these. In North America in the northern plains
of the United States and the southern plains
of Alberta and Saskatchewan, there's this unit of rock
called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth. And there are 12 of them
that everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
that went extinct. And so we will evaluate them. And that's sort of what I've been doing. So my students, my staff,
we've been cutting them open. Now as you can imagine,
cutting open a leg bone is one thing, but when you go to a museum and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?" they say, "Go away." (Laughter) So here are 12 dinosaurs. And we want to look at these three first. So these are dinosaurs
that are called Pachycephalosaurus. And everybody knows
that these three animals are related. And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever. But no one ever considered
that they might be more closely related. In other words, people looked at them
and they saw the differences. And you all know
that if you are going to determine whether you're related
to your brother or your sister, you can't do it by looking at differences. You can only determine relatedness
by looking for similarities. So people were looking at these and they were talking
about how different they are. Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
thick dome on its head, and it's got some little bumps
on the back of its head, and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
on the end of its nose. And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
from the same age, lived at the same time, has spikes sticking out
the back of its head. It's got a little, tiny dome, and it's got a bunch
of gnarly stuff on its nose. And then there's this thing
called Dracorex hogwartsia. Guess where that came from? Dragon. So here's a dinosaur that has spikes
sticking out of its head, no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose. Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff
sort of looked alike. But they did look at these three and they said, "These
are three different dinosaurs, and Dracorex is probably
the most primitive of them. And the other one
is more primitive than the other." It's unclear to me how they actually
sorted these three of them out. But if you line them up, if you just take those three skulls
and just line them up, they line up like this. Dracorex is the littlest one, Stygimoloch is the middle-size one, Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. And one would think,
that should give me a clue. (Laughter) But it didn't give them a clue. (Laughter) Because, well we know why. Scientists like to name things. So if we cut open Dracorex -- I cut open our Dracorex -- and look, it was spongy inside,
really spongy inside. I mean, it is a juvenile
and it's growing really fast. So it is going to get bigger. If you cut open Stygimoloch,
it is doing the same thing. The dome, that little dome,
is growing really fast. It's inflating very fast. What's interesting is the spike
on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well. The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing, which means they're getting smaller
as that dome is getting bigger. And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back
of its head were also resorbing. So just with these three dinosaurs, as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series
of the same animal. Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct. (Laughter) OK. (Laughter) Which of course means
we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with. So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --
he and I were looking at Triceratops. And before the year 2000 -- now remember, Triceratops was first
found in the 1800s -- before 2000, no one had ever seen
a juvenile Triceratops. There's a Triceratops
in every museum in the world, but no one had ever collected a juvenile. And we know why, right? Because everybody wants to have a big one. So everyone had a big one. So we went out and collected
a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones. They're everywhere,
they're all over the place. So we have a whole bunch
of them at our museum. (Laughter) And everybody says
it's because I have a little museum. When you have a little museum,
you have little dinosaurs. (Laughter) If you look at the Triceratops, you can see it's changing,
it's shape-shifting. As the juveniles are growing up,
their horns actually curve backwards. And then as they get older,
the horns grow forward. And that's pretty cool. If you look along the edge of the frill, they have these little triangular bones
that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do
on the Pachycephalosaurs. And then, because the juveniles
are in my collection, I cut them open ... (Laughter) and look inside. And the little one is really spongy. And the middle-size one is really spongy. But what was interesting
was the adult Triceratops was also spongy. And this is a skull
that is two meters long. It's a big skull. But there's another dinosaur
that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops,
except it's bigger, and it's called Torosaurus. And Torosaurus, when we cut
into it, has mature bone. But it's got these big
holes in its shield. And everybody says, "A Triceratops and a Torosaurus
can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger
than the other one." (Laughter) "And it has holes in its frill." And I said, "Well do we have
any juvenile Torosauruses?" And they said, "Well, no,
but it has holes in its frill." So one of my graduate
students, John Scannella, looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole
starting to form in Triceratops and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones
between Triceratops and Torosaurus, which was pretty cool. So now we know that Torosaurus
is actually a grown-up Triceratops. Now when we name dinosaurs, when we name anything,
the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out. So Torosaurus is extinct. Triceratops, if you've heard the news,
a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong. They thought Torosaurus should be kept
and Triceratops thrown out, but that's not going to happen. (Laughter) All right, so we can do this
with a bunch of dinosaurs. I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. Anatotitan: giant duck. It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur. Here's another one. So we look at the bone histology. The bone histology tells us
that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile, or at least a subadult, and the other one is an adult,
and we have an ontogeny. And we get rid of Anatotitan. So we can just keep doing this. And the last one is T. Rex. So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus. (Laughter) Again, it makes you wonder. (Laughter) But they had a good question. They were looking at them and they said,
"One's got 17 teeth, and the biggest one's got 12 teeth. And that doesn't make any sense at all, because we don't know of any dinosaurs
that gain teeth as they get older. So it must be true -- they must be different." So we cut into them. And sure enough,
Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone. It looks like it could still get bigger. And at the Museum
of the Rockies where we work, I have four T. rexes,
so I can cut a whole bunch of them. But I didn't have to cut
any of them really, because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out
the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14. And of course, Nano has 17. And we just went out and looked
at other people's collections and we found one that has
sort of 15 teeth. So again, real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny
included Nanotyrannus, and therefore we can take out
another dinosaur. (Laughter) So when it comes down
to our end Cretaceous, we have seven left. And that's a good number. That's a good number
to go extinct, I think. Now as you can imagine, this is not very popular
with fourth-graders. (Laughter) Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,
they memorize them. And they're not happy with this. (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause)

What is bipolar disorder? The word bipolar means two extremes. For the many millions experiencing
bipolar disorder around the world, life is split between 
two different realities - elation and depression. Although there are many variations
of bipolar disorder, let's consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs
alongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, 
less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods
of depression. For someone seesawing between
emotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance
necessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1's extreme highs are known
as manic episodes, and they can make a person range from
feeling irritable to invincible. But these euphoric episodes exceed
ordinary feelings of joy, causing troubling symptoms 
like racing thoughts, sleeplessness, rapid speech, impuslive actions, and risky behaviors. Without treatment, these episodes
become more frequent, intense, and take longer to subside. The depressed phase of bipolar disorder
manifests in many ways - a low mood, dwindling interest in hobbies, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, restlessness or slowness, or persistent thoughts of suicide. Worldwide, about one 
to three percent of adults experience the broad range of symptoms
that indicate bipolar disorder. Most of those people are functional,
contributing members of society, and their lives, choices, 
and relationships aren't defined by the disorder, but still, for many, the consequences
are serious. The illness can undermine educational
and professional performance, relationships, financial security, and personal safety. So what causes bipolar disorder? Researchers think a key player is 
the brain's intricate wiring. Healthy brains maintain strong connections
between neurons thanks to the brain's continuous efforts
to prune itself and remove unused or faulty
neural connections. This process is important because our 
neural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network
that's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance
of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. But despite these insights, we can't pin
bipolar disorder down to a single cause. In reality, it's a complex problem. For example, the brain's amygdala
is involved in thinking, long-term memory, and emotional processing. In this brain region, factors as varied
as genetics and social trauma may create abnormalities and trigger
the symptoms of bipolar disorder. The condition tends to run in families, so we do know that genetics have
a lot to do with it. But that doesn't mean there's
a single bipolar gene. In fact, the likelihood of developing
bipolar disorder is driven by the interactions between
many genes in a complicated recipe we're still
trying to understand. The causes are complex, and consequently, diagnosing and living
with bipolar disorder is a challenge. Despite this, the disorder 
is controllable. Certain medications like lithium can help
manage risky thoughts and behaviors by stabilizing moods. These mood stabilizing medications work by
decreasing abnormal activity in the brain, thereby strengthening the viable
neural connections. Other frequently used medications
include antipsychotics, which alter the effects of dopamine, and electroconvulsive therapy, which works like a carefully controlled
seizure in the brain, is sometimes used as 
an emergency treatment. Some bipolar patients reject treatment because they're afraid it will
dim their emotions and destroy their creativity. But modern psychiatry is actively
trying to avoid that. Today, doctors work with patients
on a case-by-case basis to administer a combination of treatments
and therapies that allows them to live 
to their fullest possible potential. And beyond treatment, people with
bipolar disorder can benefit from even simpler changes. Those include regular exercise, good sleep habits, and sobriety from drugs and alcohol, not to mention the acceptance
and empathy of family and friends. Remember, bipolar disorder 
is a medical condition, not a person's fault, or their whole identity, and it's something that can be controlled through a combination of medical 
treatments doing their work internally, friends and family fostering acceptance
and understanding on the outside, and people with bipolar disorder

What is bipolar disorder? The word bipolar means two extremes. For the many millions experiencing
bipolar disorder around the world, life is split between 
two different realities - elation and depression. Although there are many variations
of bipolar disorder, let's consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs
alongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, 
less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods
of depression. For someone seesawing between
emotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance
necessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1's extreme highs are known

neural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network
that's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance
of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. But despite these insights, we can't pin
bipolar disorder down to a single cause. In reality, it's a complex problem. For example, the brain's amygdala
is involved in thinking, long-term memory, and emotional processing. In this brain region, factors as varied
as genetics and social trauma may create abnormalities and trigger
the symptoms of bipolar disorder. The condition tends to run in families, so we do know that genetics have
a lot to do with it. But that doesn't mean there's
a single bipolar gene. In fact, the likelihood of developing
bipolar disorder is driven by the interactions between
many genes in a complicated recipe we're still
trying to understand. The causes are complex, and consequently, diagnosing and living
with bipolar disorder is a challenge. Despite this, the disorder 
is controllable. Certain medications like lithium can help
manage risky thoughts and behaviors by stabilizing moods. These mood stabilizing medications work by
decreasing abnormal activity in the brain, thereby strengthening the viable
neural connections. Other frequently used medications
include antipsychotics, which alter the effects of dopamine, and electroconvulsive therapy, which works like a carefully controlled
seizure in the brain, is sometimes used as 
an emergency treatment. Some bipolar patients reject treatment because they're afraid it will
dim their emotions and destroy their creativity. But modern psychiatry is actively
trying to avoid that. Today, doctors work with patients
on a case-by-case basis to administer a combination of treatments
and therapies that allows them to live 
to their fullest possible potential. And beyond treatment, people with
bipolar disorder can benefit from even simpler changes. Those include regular exercise, good sleep habits, and sobriety from drugs and alcohol, not to mention the acceptance
and empathy of family and friends. Remember, bipolar disorder 
is a medical condition, not a person's fault, or their whole identity, and it's something that can be controlled through a combination of medical 
treatments doing their work internally, friends and family fostering acceptance
and understanding on the outside, and people with bipolar disorder 
empowering themselves to find balance in their lives.

**Transcript**:
What is bipolar disorder? The word bipolar means two extremes. For the many millions experiencing
bipolar disorder around the world, life is split between 
two different realities - elation and depression. Although there are many variations
of bipolar disorder, let's consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs
alongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, 
less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods
of depression. For someone seesawing between
emotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance
necessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1's extreme highs are known
as manic episodes, and they can make a person range from
feeling irritable to invincible. But these euphoric episodes exceed
ordinary feelings of joy, causing troubling symptoms 
like racing thoughts, sleeplessness, rapid speech, impuslive actions, and risky behaviors. Without treatment, these episodes
become more frequent, intense, and take longer to subside. The depressed phase of bipolar disorder
manifests in many ways - a low mood, dwindling interest in hobbies, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, restlessness or slowness, or persistent thoughts of suicide. Worldwide, about one 
to three percent of adults experience the broad range of symptoms
that indicate bipolar disorder. Most of those people are functional,
contributing members of society, and their lives, choices, 
and relationships aren't defined by the disorder, but still, for many, the consequences
are serious. The illness can undermine educational
and professional performance, relationships, financial security, and personal safety. So what causes bipolar disorder? Researchers think a key player is 
the brain's intricate wiring. Healthy brains maintain strong connections
between neurons thanks to the brain's continuous efforts
to prune itself and remove unused or faulty
neural connections. This process is important because our 
neural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network
that's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance

I like chocolate a lot. This statement
comes as a surprise to absolutely no one in my life. And so every time a new
health claim about chocolate comes out in the news, I get
about five different emails in my inbox happily titled
about how chocolate is saving me from Alzheimer's and
lowering my blood pressure or keeping me skinny. So before we talk about how
you can sift through the hype to find the science and decide
what advice you are or are not going to take, let's
talk about chocolate. Chocolate begins as the seed
of the cacao tree, which is fermented and cleaned
and roasted and ground to create cocoa mass. The cocoa mass is then
liquefied and separated into cocoa solids
and cocoa butter. The ratio of cocoa solids to
other ingredients in chocolate is what gives us a
wide range of flavors. The darker the
chocolate, the greater the amount of cocoa solids. These solids contain
alkaloids like theobromine. Theobromine is a
bitter, mild stimulant with a very similar
shape to caffeine. This means that though
they are far, far milder, its effects on the body are very
similar to those of caffeine. So let's take a look at one
of the most recent chocolate health claims and see how
you can look at the science and sift through
all the media hype to find out what's
really underneath. In August, a review
of research was published that looked at
the link between chocolate and blood pressure. A summary of the review
is available online. And I'll link it here-ish so
that you can go look at it yourself. I got this link from
one of the news articles I was reading about the study. So it's something that
is readily available and that you can go
and hunt down yourself. So the review is titled Effect
of Cocoa on Blood Pressure. OK, that title makes sense. It says that researchers looked
at 856 different patients from 20 different
studies who were all given flavanol-containing
chocolate for trials ranging from two to 18 weeks. Here's where you
would have to do just a little bit of googling
to find out that flavanols are compounds found in chocolate
that have been linked to heart health. They found that
participants who were given flavanol-containing
cocoa products-- often dark chocolates-- had a
small but statistically significantly lowered
change in blood pressure. So that sounds OK-- more dark chocolate,
lower blood pressure. But if you read a little
deeper into the study, you find that they
know that they found these drops in
the two-week trials, but not in the longer trials. They also note that they
looked for correlations among subgroups that maybe
age played a role or sugar content of the chocolate
or baseline blood pressure, but that anything
they did find would have to be studied further. In some, researchers did
a review and said, hey, there might be something here. We should study this. But the media took this
and said, and I quote, "dark chocolate and cocoa powder
may help lower blood pressure." OK, "dark chocolate can
lower your blood pressure without weight gain,
says new study." And my personal favorite,
"prescription chocolate, study may sway some docs." Now, none of this is to
say that the study is wrong or to criticize the media-- OK, a little bit-- or to say that you
shouldn't eat chocolate. It's just to say
that sometimes it's good to look past the headlines
and do a little poking around in the science yourself. This way, you can make your
own informed decisions. And my decision? Go forth, do science.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that mentions the cacao tree or the origin of chocolate.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the seed of the cacao tree, the closest match would be a question that mentions the primary ingredient or the origin of chocolate. Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the closest, but it still doesn't directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but with a very low similarity score.

lower blood pressure. But if you read a little
deeper into the study, you find that they
know that they found these drops in
the two-week trials, but not in the longer trials. They also note that they
looked for correlations among subgroups that maybe
age played a role or sugar content of the chocolate
or baseline blood pressure, but that anything
they did find would have to be studied further. In some, researchers did
a review and said, hey, there might be something here. We should study this. But the media took this
and said, and I quote, "dark chocolate and cocoa powder
may help lower blood pressure." OK, "dark chocolate can
lower your blood pressure without weight gain,
says new study." And my personal favorite,
"prescription chocolate, study may sway some docs." Now, none of this is to
say that the study is wrong or to criticize the media-- OK, a little bit-- or to say that you
shouldn't eat chocolate. It's just to say
that sometimes it's good to look past the headlines
and do a little poking around in the science yourself. This way, you can make your
own informed decisions. And my decision? Go forth, do science.

"Order, order. So who do we have here?" "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen whose lurid affairs
destroyed two of Rome's finest generals and brought the end of the Republic." "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, one of the most powerful women in history whose reign brought Egypt nearly
22 years of stability and prosperity." "Uh, why don't we even know
what she looked like?" "Most of the art and descriptions
came long after her lifetime in the first century BCE, just like most of 
the things written about her." "So what do we actually know? Cleopatra VII was the last
of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian Greek family 
that governed Egypt after its conquest by Alexander the Great. She ruled jointly in Alexandria 
with her brother- to whom she was also married- until he had her exiled." "But what does all this 
have to do with Rome?" "Egypt had long been a Roman client state, and Cleopatra's father incurred 
large debts to the Republic. After being defeated by Julius Caesar
in Rome's civil war, the General Pompey sought refuge in Egypt but was executed 
by Cleopatra's brother instead." "Caesar must have liked that." "Actually, he found the murder unseemly
and demanded repayment of Egypt's debt. He could have annexed Egypt, but Cleopatra convinced him to restore
her to the throne instead." "We hear she was quite convincing." "And why not? Cleopatra 
was a fascinating woman. She commanded armies at 21, spoke several languages, and was educated in a city 
with the world's finest library and some of the greatest 
scholars of the time." "Hmm." "She kept Caesar lounging 
in Egypt for months when Rome needed him." "Caesar did more than lounge. He was fascinated by Egypt's culture
and knowledge, and he learned much during his time there. When he returned to Rome, 
he reformed the calendar, commissioned a census, made plans for a public library, and proposed many 
new infrastructure projects." "Yes, all very ambitious, 
exactly what got him assassinated." "Don't blame the Queen for Rome's
strange politics. Her job was ruling Egypt,
and she did it well. She stabilized the economy, managed the vast bureaucracy, and curbed corruption by priests
and officials. When drought hit, she opened
the granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's
stability and independence with no revolts during 
the rest of her reign." "So what went wrong?" "After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen
couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters." "Actually, it was the Roman factions who
came demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice
but to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar,
if only for the sake of their son." "And again, she provided her particular
kind of support to Marc Antony." "Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's 
countless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated
the relationships? And why are only powerful women
defined by their sexuality?" "Order." "Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic
with their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced
of their megalomania." "And yet Octavian was the one 
who attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman
in power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself." "How ironic." Cleopatra's story survived mainly
in the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps 
with rumors and stereotypes. We may never know the full truth
of her life and her reign, but we can separate fact from rumor
by putting history on trial.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: Why did Julius Caesar initially come to Egypt? 

However, the options provided in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that directly addresses the connection between Pompey and Egypt/Cleopatra's family.

Since none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of content and intent.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses Pompey's connection to Egypt and Cleopatra's family. However, since that is not available, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of the events described in the transcript.

The closest match would be Question 3, but it does not directly address Pompey's connection to Egypt. 

However, I must note that there is another question that is more closely related to the events involving Pompey.

In this case, I would choose Question 3 as the closest match, but I must emphasize that it does not directly address the connection between Pompey and Egypt/Cleopatra's family.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that I made an error in choosing Question 3 as the closest match.

A more suitable approach would be to re-evaluate the generated MCQs and look for one that directly addresses the events or circumstances surrounding Pompey's connection to Egypt and Cleopatra's family.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
"Order, order. So who do we have here?" "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen whose lurid affairs
destroyed two of Rome's finest generals and brought the end of the Republic." "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, one of the most powerful women in history whose reign brought Egypt nearly
22 years of stability and prosperity." "Uh, why don't we even know
what she looked like?" "Most of the art and descriptions
came long after her lifetime in the first century BCE, just like most of 
the things written about her." "So what do we actually know? Cleopatra VII was the last
of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian Greek family 
that governed Egypt after its conquest by Alexander the Great. She ruled jointly in Alexandria 
with her brother- to whom she was also married- until he had her exiled." "But what does all this 
have to do with Rome?" "Egypt had long been a Roman client state, and Cleopatra's father incurred 
large debts to the Republic. After being defeated by Julius Caesar
in Rome's civil war, the General Pompey sought refuge in Egypt but was executed 
by Cleopatra's brother instead." "Caesar must have liked that." "Actually, he found the murder unseemly
and demanded repayment of Egypt's debt. He could have annexed Egypt, but Cleopatra convinced him to restore
her to the throne instead." "We hear she was quite convincing." "And why not? Cleopatra 
was a fascinating woman. She commanded armies at 21, spoke several languages, and was educated in a city 
with the world's finest library and some of the greatest 
scholars of the time." "Hmm." "She kept Caesar lounging 
in Egypt for months when Rome needed him." "Caesar did more than lounge. He was fascinated by Egypt's culture
and knowledge, and he learned much during his time there. When he returned to Rome, 
he reformed the calendar, commissioned a census, made plans for a public library, and proposed many 
new infrastructure projects." "Yes, all very ambitious, 
exactly what got him assassinated." "Don't blame the Queen for Rome's
strange politics. Her job was ruling Egypt,
and she did it well. She stabilized the economy, managed the vast bureaucracy, and curbed corruption by priests
and officials. When drought hit, she opened
the granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's
stability and independence with no revolts during 
the rest of her reign." "So what went wrong?" "After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen
couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters." "Actually, it was the Roman factions who
came demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice
but to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar,
if only for the sake of their son." "And again, she provided her particular
kind of support to Marc Antony." "Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's 
countless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated
the relationships? And why are only powerful women
defined by their sexuality?" "Order." "Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic
with their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced
of their megalomania." "And yet Octavian was the one 
who attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman
in power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself." "How ironic." Cleopatra's story survived mainly
in the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps 
with rumors and stereotypes. We may never know the full truth
of her life and her reign, but we can separate fact from rumor
by putting history on trial.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 5 does not have the same intent as the ground truth MCQ (it does not ask about something that was NOT one of Cleopatra's accomplishments), I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about something that was NOT one of Cleopatra's accomplishments or a question that lists her accomplishments and asks which one is incorrect.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ's intent. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and available options, I would choose Question 5, as it is the only generated MCQ that lists some of Cleopatra's accomplishments.

**Transcript**:
Some are longer than a blue whale. Others are barely larger 
than a grain of sand. One species unleashes one of
the most deadly venoms on Earth. Another holds a secret that's behind some 
of the greatest breakthroughs in biology. They've inhabited the ocean for at least
half a billion years, and they're still flourishing as the sea
changes around them. Jellyfish are soft-bodied sea creatures
that aren't really fish. They're part of a diverse team
of gelatinous zooplankton, zooplankton being animals that drift
in the ocean. There are more than 1,000 species
of jellyfish, and many others 
that are often mistaken for them. A noted feature of jellyfish 
is a translucent bell made of a soft delicate material
called mesoglea. Sandwiched between two layers of skin, the mesoglea is more than 95% water
held together by protein fibers. The jellyfish can contract and 
relax their bells to propel themselves. They don't have a brain or a spinal cord, but a neural net around the bell's
inner margin forms a rudimentary nervous system that can sense the ocean's currents
and the touch of other animals. Jellyfish don't have typical 
digestive systems, either. These gelatinous carnivores consume 
plankton and other small sea creatures through a hole in the underside 
of their bells. The nutrients are absorbed by
an inner layer of cells with waste excreted back through
their mouths. But the jellyfish's relatively 
simple anatomy doesn't prevent it from having
some remarkable abilities. One kind of box jellyfish has 24 eyes. Scientists think it can see color and form
images within its simple nervous system. Four of its eyes are curved 
upward on stalks. This allows the jellyfish to peer
through the surface of the water, looking for the canopy 
of the mangrove trees where it feeds. In fact, this may be one 
of the only creatures with a 360-degree view of its environment. The jellyfish's sting, which helps it
capture prey and defend itself, is its most infamous calling card. In the jelly's epidermis, cells called nematocysts
lie coiled like poisonous harpoons. When they're triggered by contact,
they shoot with an explosive force. It exerts over 550 times the pressure
of Mike Tyson's strongest punch to inject venom into the victim. Some jellyfish stings barely tingle, but others cause severe skin damage. The venom of one box jellyfish
can kill a human in under five minutes, making it one of the most potent
poisons of any animal in the world. Other jellyfish superpowers 
are less lethal. One species of jellyfish glows green
when it's agitated, mostly thanks to a biofluorescent compound
called green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Scientists isolated the gene for GFP and figured out how to insert it
into the DNA of other cells. There, it acts like a biochemical beacon, marking genetic modifications, or revealing the path 
of critical molecules. Scientists have used the glow of GFP
to watch cancer cells proliferate, track the development of Alzheimer's, and illuminate countless other
biological processes. Developing the tools and techniques
from GFP has netted three scientists
a Nobel Prize in 2008, and another three in 2014. But it's jellyfish who may be the most
successful organisms on Earth. Ancient fossils prove that jellyfish
have inhabited the seas for at least 500 million years, and maybe go back over 700 million. That's longer than any 
other multiorgan animal. And as other marine animals 
are struggling to survive in warmer and more acidic oceans, the jellyfish are thriving, and perhaps getting even more numerous. It doesn't hurt that some can lay
as many as 45,000 eggs in a single night. And there's some jellyfish 
whose survival strategy almost sounds like science fiction. When the immortal jellyfish is sick,
aging, or under stress, its struggling cells can change
their identity. The tiny bell and tentacles deteriorate and turn into an immature polyp that spawns brand new clones
of the parent. As far as we know, these are the only
animals who found a loophole when facing mortality. That's pretty sophisticated for species
that are 95% water and predate the dinosaurs.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Some are longer than a blue whale. Others are barely larger 
than a grain of sand. One species unleashes one of
the most deadly venoms on Earth. Another holds a secret that's behind some 
of the greatest breakthroughs in biology. They've inhabited the ocean for at least
half a billion years, and they're still flourishing as the sea
changes around them. Jellyfish are soft-bodied sea creatures
that aren't really fish. They're part of a diverse team
of gelatinous zooplankton, zooplankton being animals that drift
in the ocean. There are more than 1,000 species
of jellyfish, and many others 
that are often mistaken for them. A noted feature of jellyfish 
is a translucent bell made of a soft delicate material
called mesoglea. Sandwiched between two layers of skin, the mesoglea is more than 95% water
held together by protein fibers. The jellyfish can contract and 
relax their bells to propel themselves. They don't have a brain or a spinal cord, but a neural net around the bell's
inner margin forms a rudimentary nervous system that can sense the ocean's currents
and the touch of other animals. Jellyfish don't have typical 
digestive systems, either. These gelatinous carnivores consume 
plankton and other small sea creatures through a hole in the underside 
of their bells. The nutrients are absorbed by
an inner layer of cells with waste excreted back through
their mouths. But the jellyfish's relatively 
simple anatomy doesn't prevent it from having
some remarkable abilities. One kind of box jellyfish has 24 eyes. Scientists think it can see color and form
images within its simple nervous system. Four of its eyes are curved 
upward on stalks. This allows the jellyfish to peer
through the surface of the water, looking for the canopy 
of the mangrove trees where it feeds. In fact, this may be one 
of the only creatures with a 360-degree view of its environment. The jellyfish's sting, which helps it
capture prey and defend itself, is its most infamous calling card. In the jelly's epidermis, cells called nematocysts
lie coiled like poisonous harpoons. When they're triggered by contact,
they shoot with an explosive force. It exerts over 550 times the pressure
of Mike Tyson's strongest punch to inject venom into the victim. Some jellyfish stings barely tingle, but others cause severe skin damage. The venom of one box jellyfish
can kill a human in under five minutes, making it one of the most potent
poisons of any animal in the world. Other jellyfish superpowers 
are less lethal. One species of jellyfish glows green
when it's agitated, mostly thanks to a biofluorescent compound
called green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Scientists isolated the gene for GFP and figured out how to insert it
into the DNA of other cells. There, it acts like a biochemical beacon, marking genetic modifications, or revealing the path 
of critical molecules. Scientists have used the glow of GFP
to watch cancer cells proliferate, track the development of Alzheimer's, and illuminate countless other
biological processes. Developing the tools and techniques
from GFP has netted three scientists
a Nobel Prize in 2008, and another three in 2014. But it's jellyfish who may be the most
successful organisms on Earth. Ancient fossils prove that jellyfish
have inhabited the seas for at least 500 million years, and maybe go back over 700 million. That's longer than any 
other multiorgan animal. And as other marine animals 
are struggling to survive in warmer and more acidic oceans, the jellyfish are thriving, and perhaps getting even more numerous. It doesn't hurt that some can lay
as many as 45,000 eggs in a single night. And there's some jellyfish 
whose survival strategy almost sounds like science fiction. When the immortal jellyfish is sick,
aging, or under stress, its struggling cells can change
their identity. The tiny bell and tentacles deteriorate and turn into an immature polyp that spawns brand new clones
of the parent. As far as we know, these are the only
animals who found a loophole when facing mortality. That's pretty sophisticated for species
that are 95% water and predate the dinosaurs.

**Transcript**:
Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?

in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?

**Transcript**:
Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes

**Transcript**:
Figs are one of my favorite foods. They're sweet and floral, and there's something
about the texture that I find so delightful—the outside is soft, but the seeds in the middle
give you this totally satisfying crunch. But it turns out that many species of figs
contain the bodies of dead wasps. I'm Anna and this is Gross Science. Figs aren't exactly your typical fruit. You can think of them as packages that contain
all of the fig tree’s flowers within them. But if the flowers are trapped inside the
fig how do they get pollinated? Well, that's where fig wasps come in. In most species, pregnant female fig wasps
carrying pollen are attracted to young figs. They enter through a tiny opening at the fig’s
bottom that’s highly selective—it usually only lets in the exact species of wasps that
pollinate it. But, even the pollinators have a hard time
getting in. Most lose their wings and antennae in the
process. The wasp’s goal is to find a home for her
babies. And the perfect home is inside the fig’s
female flowers—those are the ones that would produce seeds if they were fertilized. So, the mama wasp drops a fertilized egg inside
as many of the female flowers as she can—sometimes, up to a few hundred. But she can't get to all of them. Along the way, she winds up fertilizing the
rest of the flowers with the fig pollen she's carrying, and those flowers begin developing
seeds. Once the wasp is finished laying eggs, she
usually dies inside the fig. Each baby wasp begins to grow, encased in
a protective structure that the plant forms called a gall. The male wasps mature first. When they emerge, they find the galls of the
female wasps, many of whom are their sisters, poke inside, and impregnate them before they've
even hatched! Then, the males die inside the fig, but not
before boring tiny holes through the fig’s skin. When the females do emerge, the fig has just
started producing pollen. The female wasps pick up some of that pollen
before making their way through the holes their brothers drilled, and go off to find
a new fig to start the cycle again. But the story's not over. At this point, our fig’s seeds are finally
mature and ready to be planted. And that happens when the ripe fig is eaten
by animals, which poop out the seeds, spreading fig plants far and wide. Of course, humans eat figs, too. So, when you bite into a fig are you actually
eating the bodies of dead wasps? Well, if you’re getting your figs from the
supermarket, then most likely not. See, humans and figs have a really long history—we’ve
probably been domesticating them for over 11,000 years. So, while there are over 750 species in the
world, most of the figs we eat are a species called the “common fig,” which humans
have had a huge hand in creating. In fact, some common figs are seedless and
don’t require pollination at all. Other varieties of common fig do need to be
pollinated, but have separate male and female trees, and we only eat fruits from the female
ones. I’ll put a link in the description to a
great explanation of how common fig pollination happens, but long story short, female wasps
can only manage to lay eggs in the the figs from male trees, not female ones. But they can’t tell the difference between
the two types of trees. So, if a wasp does enter a female fruit, she’ll
pollinate it, and either manage to escape or die inside the fig. And then that fig might make it to your table. Frankly, one wasp here and there isn’t enough
to deter me from eating these things. But if you're still feeling squeamish, just
think about it this way: by eating that fig, you're benefitting from a complex and in my
view, beautiful partnership—or, what’s called a “mutualism”— between two very
different species. One that’s been delicately crafted by around
90 million years of evolution. And that certainly whets my appetite—at
least for curiosity, if not for dinner. MMMM! But also ew.

contain the bodies of dead wasps. I'm Anna and this is Gross Science. Figs aren't exactly your typical fruit. You can think of them as packages that contain
all of the fig tree’s flowers within them. But if the flowers are trapped inside the
fig how do they get pollinated? Well, that's where fig wasps come in. In most species, pregnant female fig wasps
carrying pollen are attracted to young figs. They enter through a tiny opening at the fig’s
bottom that’s highly selective—it usually only lets in the exact species of wasps that
pollinate it. But, even the pollinators have a hard time
getting in. Most lose their wings and antennae in the
process. The wasp’s goal is to find a home for her
babies. And the perfect home is inside the fig’s
female flowers—those are the ones that would produce seeds if they were fertilized. So, the mama wasp drops a fertilized egg inside
as many of the female flowers as she can—sometimes, up to a few hundred. But she can't get to all of them. Along the way, she winds up fertilizing the
rest of the flowers with the fig pollen she's carrying, and those flowers begin developing
seeds. Once the wasp is finished laying eggs, she
usually dies inside the fig. Each baby wasp begins to grow, encased in
a protective structure that the plant forms called a gall. The male wasps mature first. When they emerge, they find the galls of the
female wasps, many of whom are their sisters, poke inside, and impregnate them before they've
even hatched! Then, the males die inside the fig, but not
before boring tiny holes through the fig’s skin. When the females do emerge, the fig has just
started producing pollen. The female wasps pick up some of that pollen
before making their way through the holes their brothers drilled, and go off to find
a new fig to start the cycle again. But the story's not over. At this point, our fig’s seeds are finally
mature and ready to be planted. And that happens when the ripe fig is eaten
by animals, which poop out the seeds, spreading fig plants far and wide. Of course, humans eat figs, too. So, when you bite into a fig are you actually
eating the bodies of dead wasps? Well, if you’re getting your figs from the
supermarket, then most likely not. See, humans and figs have a really long history—we’ve
probably been domesticating them for over 11,000 years. So, while there are over 750 species in the
world, most of the figs we eat are a species called the “common fig,” which humans
have had a huge hand in creating. In fact, some common figs are seedless and
don’t require pollination at all. Other varieties of common fig do need to be
pollinated, but have separate male and female trees, and we only eat fruits from the female
ones. I’ll put a link in the description to a
great explanation of how common fig pollination happens, but long story short, female wasps
can only manage to lay eggs in the the figs from male trees, not female ones. But they can’t tell the difference between
the two types of trees. So, if a wasp does enter a female fruit, she’ll
pollinate it, and either manage to escape or die inside the fig. And then that fig might make it to your table. Frankly, one wasp here and there isn’t enough
to deter me from eating these things. But if you're still feeling squeamish, just
think about it this way: by eating that fig, you're benefitting from a complex and in my
view, beautiful partnership—or, what’s called a “mutualism”— between two very
different species. One that’s been delicately crafted by around
90 million years of evolution. And that certainly whets my appetite—at
least for curiosity, if not for dinner. MMMM! But also ew.

**Transcript**:
In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made
from wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus,
defied the laws of both man and nature. Ignoring the warnings of his father,
he rose higher and higher. To witnesses on the ground,
he looked like a god, and as he peered down from above,
he felt like one, too. But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man
was absolute and the punishment for mortals
who attempted to cross it was severe. Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus. Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded
as a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens. He invented carpentry
and all the tools used for it. He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor. He made sculptures so lifelike
that Hercules mistook them for actual men. Though skilled and celebrated,
Daedalus was egotistical and jealous. Worried that his nephew
was a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him. As punishment, Daedalus was banished
from Athens and made his way to Crete. Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed 
with open arms by Crete's King Minos. There, acting as the palace 
technical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries. For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys
that seemed alive. He invented the ship's sail and mast,
which gave humans control over the wind. With every creation, Daedalus challenged
human limitations that had so far kept mortals
separate from gods, until finally, he broke right through. King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,
had been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love
with the king's prized bull. Under this spell, she asked Daedalus
to help her seduce it. With characteristic audacity, he agreed. Daedalus constructed a hollow
wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. With Pasiphaë hiding inside
Daedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur. This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling
such a horrible perversion of natural law. As punishment, Daedalus was forced
to construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur. When it was finished, Minos then
imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower
on the island where they were to remain 
for the rest of their lives. But Daedalus was still a genius inventor. While observing the birds
that circled his prison, the means for escape became clear. He and Icarus would fly away
from their prison as only birds or gods could do. Using feathers from the flocks
that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs
of giant wings. As he strapped the wings
to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean 
would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use. Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax
and the wings would disintegrate. In either case, they surely would die. Therefore, the key to their escape
would be in keeping to the middle. With the instructions clear,
both men leapt from the tower. They were the first mortals ever to fly. While Daedalus stayed carefully
to the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed
with the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of
divine power that came with it. Daedalus could only watch in horror
as Icarus ascended higher and higher, powerless to change his son's dire fate. When the heat from the sun melted
the wax on his wings, Icarus fell from the sky. Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequences of defying 
the natural laws of mortal men in the service of his ego, Icarus was also carried away
by his own hubris. In the end, both men paid for their departure 
from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret.

**Transcript**:
In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made
from wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus,
defied the laws of both man and nature. Ignoring the warnings of his father,
he rose higher and higher. To witnesses on the ground,
he looked like a god, and as he peered down from above,
he felt like one, too. But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man
was absolute and the punishment for mortals
who attempted to cross it was severe. Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus. Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded
as a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens. He invented carpentry
and all the tools used for it. He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor. He made sculptures so lifelike
that Hercules mistook them for actual men. Though skilled and celebrated,
Daedalus was egotistical and jealous. Worried that his nephew
was a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him. As punishment, Daedalus was banished
from Athens and made his way to Crete. Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed 
with open arms by Crete's King Minos. There, acting as the palace 
technical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries. For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys
that seemed alive. He invented the ship's sail and mast,
which gave humans control over the wind. With every creation, Daedalus challenged
human limitations that had so far kept mortals
separate from gods, until finally, he broke right through. King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,
had been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love
with the king's prized bull. Under this spell, she asked Daedalus
to help her seduce it. With characteristic audacity, he agreed. Daedalus constructed a hollow
wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. With Pasiphaë hiding inside
Daedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur. This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling
such a horrible perversion of natural law. As punishment, Daedalus was forced
to construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur. When it was finished, Minos then
imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower
on the island where they were to remain 
for the rest of their lives. But Daedalus was still a genius inventor. While observing the birds
that circled his prison, the means for escape became clear. He and Icarus would fly away
from their prison as only birds or gods could do. Using feathers from the flocks
that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs
of giant wings. As he strapped the wings
to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean 
would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use. Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax
and the wings would disintegrate. In either case, they surely would die. Therefore, the key to their escape
would be in keeping to the middle. With the instructions clear,
both men leapt from the tower. They were the first mortals ever to fly. While Daedalus stayed carefully
to the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed
with the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of
divine power that came with it. Daedalus could only watch in horror
as Icarus ascended higher and higher, powerless to change his son's dire fate. When the heat from the sun melted
the wax on his wings, Icarus fell from the sky. Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequences of defying 
the natural laws of mortal men in the service of his ego, Icarus was also carried away
by his own hubris. In the end, both men paid for their departure 
from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Are you afraid of black cats? Would you open an umbrella indoors? And how do you feel about 
the number thirteen? Whether or not you believe in them, you're probably familiar with a few
of these superstitions. So how did it happen that people
all over the world knock on wood, or avoid stepping on sidewalk cracks? Well, although they have no basis
in science, many of these weirdly specific beliefs
and practices do have equally weird
and specific origins. Because they involve supernatural causes, it's no surprise that many superstitions
are based in religion. For example. the number thirteen was
associated with the biblical Last Supper, where Jesus Christ dined 
with his twelve disciples just before being arrested and crucified. The resulting idea that having thirteen
people at a table was bad luck eventually expanded into thirteen
being an unlucky number in general. Now, this fear of the number thirteen,
called triskaidekaphobia, is so common that many buildings around 
the world skip the thirteenth floor, with the numbers going straight from
twelve to fourteen. Of course, many people consider
the story of the Last Supper to be true but other superstitions come from 
religious traditions that few people believe in
or even remember. Knocking on wood is thought to come from 
the folklore of the ancient Indo-Europeans or possibly people who predated them who believed that trees were home
to various spirits. Touching a tree would invoke 
the protection or blessing of the spirit within. And somehow, this tradition survived long after 
belief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today
in countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan
religions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate
coincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear
the number 17 because the Roman numeral XVII
can be rearranged to form the word vixi, meaning my life had ended. Similarly, the word for the number four sounds almost identical 
to the word for death in Cantonese, as well as languages like Japanese and Korean that have borrowed 
Chinese numerals. And since the number one also
sounds like the word for must, the number fourteen sounds
like the phrase must die. That's a lot of numbers for elevators
and international hotels to avoid. And believe it or not, some superstitions actually make sense, or at least they did until we 
forgot their original purpose. For example, theater scenery used to
consist of large painted backdrops, raised and lowered by stagehands
who would whistle to signal each other. Absentminded whistles from other people
could cause an accident. But the taboo against whistling backstage
still exists today, long after the stagehands started using
radio headsets. Along the same lines, lighting three
cigarettes from the same match really could cause bad luck
if you were a soldier in a foxhole where keeping a match lit too long
could draw attention from an enemy sniper. Most smokers no longer have to worry
about snipers, but the superstition lives on. So why do people cling to these bits
of forgotten religions, coincidences, and outdated advice? Aren't they being totally irrational? Well, yes, but for many people, superstitions are based more
on cultural habit than conscious belief. After all, no one is born knowing to avoid
walking under ladders or whistling indoors, but if you grow up being told
by your family to avoid these things, chances are they'll make 
you uncomfortable, even after you logically understand
that nothing bad will happen. And since doing something like knocking
on wood doesn't require much effort, following the superstition is often
easier than consciously resisting it. Besides, superstitions 
often do seem to work. Maybe you remember hitting a home run
while wearing your lucky socks. This is just our psychological 
bias at work. You're far less likely to remember 
all the times you struck out while wearing the same socks. But believing that they work
could actually make you play better by giving you the illusion of having
greater control over events. So in situations where that confidence
can make a difference, like sports, those crazy superstitions might not
be so crazy after all.

in science, many of these weirdly specific beliefs
and practices do have equally weird
and specific origins. Because they involve supernatural causes, it's no surprise that many superstitions
are based in religion. For example. the number thirteen was
associated with the biblical Last Supper, where Jesus Christ dined 
with his twelve disciples just before being arrested and crucified. The resulting idea that having thirteen
people at a table was bad luck eventually expanded into thirteen
being an unlucky number in general. Now, this fear of the number thirteen,
called triskaidekaphobia, is so common that many buildings around 
the world skip the thirteenth floor, with the numbers going straight from
twelve to fourteen. Of course, many people consider
the story of the Last Supper to be true but other superstitions come from 
religious traditions that few people believe in
or even remember. Knocking on wood is thought to come from 
the folklore of the ancient Indo-Europeans or possibly people who predated them who believed that trees were home
to various spirits. Touching a tree would invoke 
the protection or blessing of the spirit within. And somehow, this tradition survived long after 
belief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today
in countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan
religions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate
coincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear
the number 17 because the Roman numeral XVII
can be rearranged to form the word vixi, meaning my life had ended. Similarly, the word for the number four sounds almost identical 
to the word for death in Cantonese, as well as languages like Japanese and Korean that have borrowed 
Chinese numerals. And since the number one also
sounds like the word for must, the number fourteen sounds
like the phrase must die. That's a lot of numbers for elevators
and international hotels to avoid. And believe it or not, some superstitions actually make sense, or at least they did until we 
forgot their original purpose. For example, theater scenery used to
consist of large painted backdrops, raised and lowered by stagehands
who would whistle to signal each other. Absentminded whistles from other people
could cause an accident. But the taboo against whistling backstage
still exists today, long after the stagehands started using
radio headsets. Along the same lines, lighting three
cigarettes from the same match really could cause bad luck
if you were a soldier in a foxhole where keeping a match lit too long
could draw attention from an enemy sniper. Most smokers no longer have to worry
about snipers, but the superstition lives on. So why do people cling to these bits
of forgotten religions, coincidences, and outdated advice? Aren't they being totally irrational? Well, yes, but for many people, superstitions are based more
on cultural habit than conscious belief. After all, no one is born knowing to avoid
walking under ladders or whistling indoors, but if you grow up being told
by your family to avoid these things, chances are they'll make 
you uncomfortable, even after you logically understand
that nothing bad will happen. And since doing something like knocking
on wood doesn't require much effort, following the superstition is often
easier than consciously resisting it. Besides, superstitions 
often do seem to work. Maybe you remember hitting a home run
while wearing your lucky socks. This is just our psychological 
bias at work. You're far less likely to remember 
all the times you struck out while wearing the same socks. But believing that they work
could actually make you play better by giving you the illusion of having
greater control over events. So in situations where that confidence
can make a difference, like sports, those crazy superstitions might not
be so crazy after all.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1963, a high school teacher changed the way
the world looked at "The Wizard of Oz." His name was Henry Littlefield, and he was teaching 
an American history class. He'd made it to the late 19th century,
a time called The Gilded Age, but he was struggling to keep
his class interested in the complex social and economic
issues of the time. Then one night, while he was reading "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
to his daughters, he had an idea. In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver
to the gold standard to put more money in circulation and make it easier for farmers to borrow. In the book, Dorothy walked to
the Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road in her silver shoes. The movie's ruby red slippers 
started out as silver. Silver and gold on the road to prosperity. L. Frank Baum had published
the book in 1900 at the height of The Gilded Age, and the analogy didn't seem
out of the question. No one else had seen these connections, but that didn't deter Littlefield. He taught his class about The Gilded Age
using the book, and soon he and his students were
finding more connections. For instance, in the late 1890s, the U.S. had recently recovered
from the Civil War and integrated vast new territories, bringing an era of prosperity for some. But while industry and finance
in the North and East prospered, farmers across the South
and Midwest struggled. This led to the Populist movement, uniting farmers and workers against
urban elites. By 1896, the movement had grown
into the People's Party, and its support of Democrat
Williams Jennings Bryan put him in reach of the presidency. Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield, Dorothy is a typical American girl whose hard life in Kansas is literally
turned upside down by powerful forces outside her control. The munchkins are the common people
oppressed by the Witch of the East, banks and monopolies. The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually
quite resourceful, the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker
dehumanized by factory labor, and the Cowardly Lion 
is William Jennings Bryan who could be an influential figure
if only he were brave enough to adopt the Populist's radical program. Together, they travel along
a golden yellow road towards a grand city whose ruler's power
turns out to be built on illusions. Littlefield published some of these
observations in an essay. His claim that this fantasy was actually
a subversive critique of American capitalism appealed
to many people in 1960s. Other scholars took up the theme, and the proposed analogies
and connections multiplied. They suggested that Dorothy's dog Toto represented the teetotalers
of the prohibition party. Oz was clearly the abbreviation
for ounces, an important unit in the silver debate. The list goes on. By the 1980s, this understanding
of the book was accepted so widely that several American history textbooks mentioned it in discussions of
late 19th century politics. But is the theory right? L. Frank Baum's introduction claims the 
book is just an innocent children's story. Could he have been deliberately
throwing people off the trail? And is it fair to second guess
him so many decades later? There's no definitive answer, which is part of why authorial intent is a complex, tangled, fun question
to unravel. And some recent scholars have interpreted
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" in the opposite way as Littlefield. They claim it's a celebration of the 
new urban consumer culture. Historian William Leach argued that
the dazzling Emerald City of Oz was meant to acclimate people
to the shiny, new America. In the end, all we know
for sure is that Baum, inspired by European folk legends, had set out to create one
for American children. And whether or not he intended
any hidden meanings, its continuing relevance suggests
he succeeded in creating a fairytale
America can call its own.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1963, a high school teacher changed the way
the world looked at "The Wizard of Oz." His name was Henry Littlefield, and he was teaching 
an American history class. He'd made it to the late 19th century,
a time called The Gilded Age, but he was struggling to keep
his class interested in the complex social and economic
issues of the time. Then one night, while he was reading "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
to his daughters, he had an idea. In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver
to the gold standard to put more money in circulation and make it easier for farmers to borrow. In the book, Dorothy walked to
the Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road in her silver shoes. The movie's ruby red slippers 
started out as silver. Silver and gold on the road to prosperity. L. Frank Baum had published
the book in 1900 at the height of The Gilded Age, and the analogy didn't seem
out of the question. No one else had seen these connections, but that didn't deter Littlefield. He taught his class about The Gilded Age
using the book, and soon he and his students were
finding more connections. For instance, in the late 1890s, the U.S. had recently recovered
from the Civil War and integrated vast new territories, bringing an era of prosperity for some. But while industry and finance
in the North and East prospered, farmers across the South
and Midwest struggled. This led to the Populist movement, uniting farmers and workers against
urban elites. By 1896, the movement had grown
into the People's Party, and its support of Democrat
Williams Jennings Bryan put him in reach of the presidency. Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield, Dorothy is a typical American girl whose hard life in Kansas is literally
turned upside down by powerful forces outside her control. The munchkins are the common people
oppressed by the Witch of the East, banks and monopolies. The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually
quite resourceful, the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker
dehumanized by factory labor, and the Cowardly Lion 
is William Jennings Bryan who could be an influential figure
if only he were brave enough to adopt the Populist's radical program. Together, they travel along
a golden yellow road towards a grand city whose ruler's power
turns out to be built on illusions. Littlefield published some of these
observations in an essay. His claim that this fantasy was actually
a subversive critique of American capitalism appealed
to many people in 1960s. Other scholars took up the theme, and the proposed analogies
and connections multiplied. They suggested that Dorothy's dog Toto represented the teetotalers
of the prohibition party. Oz was clearly the abbreviation
for ounces, an important unit in the silver debate. The list goes on. By the 1980s, this understanding
of the book was accepted so widely that several American history textbooks mentioned it in discussions of
late 19th century politics. But is the theory right? L. Frank Baum's introduction claims the 
book is just an innocent children's story. Could he have been deliberately
throwing people off the trail? And is it fair to second guess
him so many decades later? There's no definitive answer, which is part of why authorial intent is a complex, tangled, fun question
to unravel. And some recent scholars have interpreted
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" in the opposite way as Littlefield. They claim it's a celebration of the 
new urban consumer culture. Historian William Leach argued that
the dazzling Emerald City of Oz was meant to acclimate people
to the shiny, new America. In the end, all we know
for sure is that Baum, inspired by European folk legends, had set out to create one
for American children. And whether or not he intended
any hidden meanings, its continuing relevance suggests
he succeeded in creating a fairytale
America can call its own.

**Transcript**:
One foggy morning in 1884, the British steamer "Rumney" crashed
into the French ship "Frigorifique." Seeing their ship filling with water, the French crew climbed 
aboard the "Rumney." But as they sailed towards 
the nearest port, a silent form suddenly emerged
from the fog: the abandoned "Frigorifique." It was too late to turn, and the impact was enough 
to sink the "Rumney." As the sailors scrambled 
into the lifeboats, the empty "Frigorifique"
sailed back into the fog, having seemingly taken its revenge. In reality, the French sailors had left
the engines running, and the "Frigorifique" sailed in a circle
before striking the "Rumney" and finally sinking. But its story became one of the many tales
of ghost ships, unmanned vessels that apparently
sail themselves. And although they've influenced
works like "Dracula" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," crewless ships aren't the product
of ghostly spirits, just physics at work. One of the most famous ghost ships
was the "Mary Celeste" found sailing the Atlantic in 1872
with no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo
and a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits 
were two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces
a certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts
an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid
that's been displaced. This phenomenon is called
Archimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than 
the downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when 
they're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water
larger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull
would increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the "Mary Celeste's" crew feared
when they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account 
for fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point
of equilibrium, when it reached 
the same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water
wasn't enough to sink the ship and the "Mary Celeste"
was found a few days later while the unfortunate crew 
never made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale 
of "A. Ernest Mills," a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to 
the sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later,
it was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's
heavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull
made the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity 
became less than the buoyant force and the ship floated back to the surface. But how do we explain the most
enduring aspect of ghost ship legends: multiple sightings of the same ships 
hundreds of miles and several years apart? The answer lies in ocean currents, which are like invisible rivers flowing
through the ocean. Factors, like temperature, salinity, wind, gravity, and the Coriolis effect from
the Earth's rotation create a complex system of water movement. That applies both at the ocean's surface
and deep below. Sailors have always known about currents, but their patterns weren't well known
until recently. In fact, tracking abandoned ships was how
scientists determined the shape and speed of the Atlantic Gyre, the Gulf Stream, and related currents in the first place. Beginning in 1883, 
the U.S. Hydrographic Office began collecting monthly data
that included navigation hazards, like derelict ships, whose locations
were reported by passing vessels. So abandoned ships may not be moved
by ghost crews or supernatural curses, but they are a real 
and fascinating phenomenon born through the ocean and kept afloat by powerful, invisible,
scientifically studied forces.

**Transcript**:
One foggy morning in 1884, the British steamer "Rumney" crashed
into the French ship "Frigorifique." Seeing their ship filling with water, the French crew climbed 
aboard the "Rumney." But as they sailed towards 
the nearest port, a silent form suddenly emerged
from the fog: the abandoned "Frigorifique." It was too late to turn, and the impact was enough 
to sink the "Rumney." As the sailors scrambled 
into the lifeboats, the empty "Frigorifique"
sailed back into the fog, having seemingly taken its revenge. In reality, the French sailors had left
the engines running, and the "Frigorifique" sailed in a circle
before striking the "Rumney" and finally sinking. But its story became one of the many tales
of ghost ships, unmanned vessels that apparently
sail themselves. And although they've influenced
works like "Dracula" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," crewless ships aren't the product
of ghostly spirits, just physics at work. One of the most famous ghost ships
was the "Mary Celeste" found sailing the Atlantic in 1872
with no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo
and a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits 
were two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces
a certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts
an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid
that's been displaced. This phenomenon is called
Archimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than 
the downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when 
they're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water
larger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull
would increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the "Mary Celeste's" crew feared
when they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account 
for fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point
of equilibrium, when it reached 
the same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water
wasn't enough to sink the ship and the "Mary Celeste"
was found a few days later while the unfortunate crew 
never made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale 
of "A. Ernest Mills," a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to 
the sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later,
it was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's
heavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull
made the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity 
became less than the buoyant force and the ship floated back to the surface. But how do we explain the most
enduring aspect of ghost ship legends: multiple sightings of the same ships 
hundreds of miles and several years apart? The answer lies in ocean currents, which are like invisible rivers flowing
through the ocean. Factors, like temperature, salinity, wind, gravity, and the Coriolis effect from
the Earth's rotation create a complex system of water movement. That applies both at the ocean's surface
and deep below. Sailors have always known about currents, but their patterns weren't well known
until recently. In fact, tracking abandoned ships was how
scientists determined the shape and speed of the Atlantic Gyre, the Gulf Stream, and related currents in the first place. Beginning in 1883, 
the U.S. Hydrographic Office began collecting monthly data
that included navigation hazards, like derelict ships, whose locations
were reported by passing vessels. So abandoned ships may not be moved
by ghost crews or supernatural curses, but they are a real 
and fascinating phenomenon born through the ocean and kept afloat by powerful, invisible,
scientifically studied forces.

**Transcript**:
In 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora
plunged parts of the world into darkness and marked a gloomy period that came 
to be known as The Year Without a Summer. So when Mary and Percy Shelley arrived
at the House of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva, their vacation was mostly spent indoors. For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge
to his literary companions: who could write the most chilling
ghost story? This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary. Over the next few months, she would craft
the story of “Frankenstein.” Popular depictions may evoke a green
and groaning figure, but that's not Mary Shelley's monster. In fact, in the book, Frankenstein
refers to the nameless monster's maker, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. So tense is the struggle between
creator and creature that the two have merged 
in our collective imagination. Before you read 
or reread the original text, there are several other things that 
are helpful to know about Frankenstein and how it came to assume 
its multiple meanings. The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's
futile quest to impart and sustain life. He constructs his monster
part by part from dead matter and electrifies it into conscious being. Upon completing the experiment, however,
he's horrified at the result and flees. But time and space aren't enough
to banish the abandoned monster, and the plot turns on a chilling chase
between the two. Shelley subtitled her 
fireside ghost story, "The Modern Prometheus." That's in reference to the Greek myth
of the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods
and gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock
and eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence
in the literature of the Romantic Period during the 18th century. Mary was a prominent Romantic, and shared the movement's appreciation for
nature, emotion, and the purity of art. Two years after Mary
released “Frankenstein,” Percy reimagined the plight
of Prometheus in his lyrical drama, "Prometheus Unbound." The Romantics used 
these mythical references to signal the purity of the ancient world
in contrast to modernity. They typically regarded science
with suspicion, and "Frankenstein" is one of the first
cautionary tales about artificial intelligence. For Shelley, the terror
was not supernatural, but born in a lab. In addition, gothic devices 
infuse the text. The gothic genre is characterized
by unease, eerie settings, the grotesque, and the fear of oblivion— all elements that can 
be seen in "Frankenstein." But this horror had roots 
in personal trauma, as well. The text is filled with references
to Shelley's own circumstances. Born in 1797, Mary was the child
of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were radical intellectual figures, and her mother's book,
"A Vindication of the Rights of Women," is a key feminist text. Tragically, she died as a result
of complications from Mary’s birth. Mary was haunted by her mother's death, and later experienced her own
problems with childbirth. She became pregnant following
her elopement with Percy at 16, but that baby died shortly after birth. Out of four more pregnancies,
only one of their children survived. Some critics have linked this tragedy
to the themes explored in "Frankenstein." Shelley depicts birth as both creative
and destructive, and the monster becomes a disfigured
mirror of the natural cycle of life. The monster, therefore, embodies
Dr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature in the quest for glory. This constitutes his fatal flaw, 
or hamartia. His god complex is most clear in the line, "Life and death appear to me ideal bounds
which I should first break through and pour a torrent of light
onto our dark world." Although he accomplishes
something awe-inspiring, he has played with fire at his own
ethical expense. And that decision echoes 
throughout the novel, which is full of references to fire
and imagery that contrasts light and dark. These moments suggest not only the spark
of Prometheus's fire, but the power of radical ideas to expose
darker areas of life.

part by part from dead matter and electrifies it into conscious being. Upon completing the experiment, however,
he's horrified at the result and flees. But time and space aren't enough
to banish the abandoned monster, and the plot turns on a chilling chase
between the two. Shelley subtitled her 
fireside ghost story, "The Modern Prometheus." That's in reference to the Greek myth
of the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods
and gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock
and eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence
in the literature of the Romantic Period during the 18th century. Mary was a prominent Romantic, and shared the movement's appreciation for
nature, emotion, and the purity of art. Two years after Mary
released “Frankenstein,” Percy reimagined the plight
of Prometheus in his lyrical drama, "Prometheus Unbound." The Romantics used 
these mythical references to signal the purity of the ancient world
in contrast to modernity. They typically regarded science
with suspicion, and "Frankenstein" is one of the first
cautionary tales about artificial intelligence. For Shelley, the terror
was not supernatural, but born in a lab. In addition, gothic devices 
infuse the text. The gothic genre is characterized
by unease, eerie settings, the grotesque, and the fear of oblivion— all elements that can 
be seen in "Frankenstein." But this horror had roots 
in personal trauma, as well. The text is filled with references
to Shelley's own circumstances. Born in 1797, Mary was the child
of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were radical intellectual figures, and her mother's book,
"A Vindication of the Rights of Women," is a key feminist text. Tragically, she died as a result
of complications from Mary’s birth. Mary was haunted by her mother's death, and later experienced her own
problems with childbirth. She became pregnant following
her elopement with Percy at 16, but that baby died shortly after birth. Out of four more pregnancies,
only one of their children survived. Some critics have linked this tragedy
to the themes explored in "Frankenstein." Shelley depicts birth as both creative
and destructive, and the monster becomes a disfigured
mirror of the natural cycle of life. The monster, therefore, embodies
Dr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature in the quest for glory. This constitutes his fatal flaw, 
or hamartia. His god complex is most clear in the line, "Life and death appear to me ideal bounds
which I should first break through and pour a torrent of light
onto our dark world." Although he accomplishes
something awe-inspiring, he has played with fire at his own
ethical expense. And that decision echoes 
throughout the novel, which is full of references to fire
and imagery that contrasts light and dark. These moments suggest not only the spark
of Prometheus's fire, but the power of radical ideas to expose
darker areas of life.

**Transcript**:
In 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora
plunged parts of the world into darkness and marked a gloomy period that came 
to be known as The Year Without a Summer. So when Mary and Percy Shelley arrived
at the House of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva, their vacation was mostly spent indoors. For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge
to his literary companions: who could write the most chilling
ghost story? This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary. Over the next few months, she would craft
the story of “Frankenstein.” Popular depictions may evoke a green
and groaning figure, but that's not Mary Shelley's monster. In fact, in the book, Frankenstein
refers to the nameless monster's maker, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. So tense is the struggle between
creator and creature that the two have merged 
in our collective imagination. Before you read 
or reread the original text, there are several other things that 
are helpful to know about Frankenstein and how it came to assume 
its multiple meanings. The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's
futile quest to impart and sustain life. He constructs his monster

**Transcript**:
Created by logician Raymond Smullyan and popularized by his colleague
George Boolos, this riddle has been called the hardest
logic puzzle ever. You and your team have crash-landed
on an ancient planet. The only way off is to appease
its three alien overlords, Tee, Eff, and Arr, by giving them the correct artifacts. Unfortunately, you don't
know who is who. From an inscription, you learn that you
may ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord. Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time. But there's a problem. You've deciphered the language enough
to ask any question, but you don't know which of the two
words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no. How can you still figure out 
which alien is which? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,
but downright impossible. What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer
nor know if it's true? But it can be done. The key is to carefully formulate
our questions so that any answer 
yields useful information. First of all, we can get around
to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves
in the questions, and secondly, if we load each question
with a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not
won't actually matter. To see how that could work, imagine our question
is whether two plus two is four. Instead of posing it directly, we say, "If I asked you whether
two plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?" If 'ozo' means yes 
and the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, "ozo." But what if we ask Eff? Well, it would answer "ulu,"
or no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to 
our embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons. If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure. A double positive and a double negative
both result in a positive. Now, we can be sure that asking
either Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo'
if the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what 
each word actually means. Unfortunately, 
this doesn't help us with Arr. But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr. Then we can use the second to find out
whether its Tee or Eff. And once we know that, we can ask it to identify 
one of the others. So let's begin. Ask the alien in the middle, "If I asked you whether the overlord on
my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?" If the reply is 'ozo,' 
there are two possibilities. You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined
isn't Arr and ask, "If I asked 'are you Eff?' 
would you answer 'ozo'?" Since you don't have to worry about
the random possibility, either answer will 
establish its identity. Now that you know whether its
answers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center
overlord is Arr. The process of elimination will identify
the remaining one. The satisfied overlords help you
repair your ship and you prepare for takeoff. Allowed one final question, you ask
Tee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers "ozo." Too bad you still don't know 
what that means.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What are you trying to do to solve the puzzle?
Options: A. Trick the aliens into repairing your ship, B. Escape from the aliens by finding the correct route to your ship, C. Learn the correct identity of each of the three aliens
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the purpose of the first question asked to the alien in the middle?
Options: A. To identify the alien overlord on the left, B. To determine whether the alien overlord on the right is Arr, C. To identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr, D. To ask a random question

in which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined
isn't Arr and ask, "If I asked 'are you Eff?' 
would you answer 'ozo'?" Since you don't have to worry about
the random possibility, either answer will 
establish its identity. Now that you know whether its
answers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center
overlord is Arr. The process of elimination will identify
the remaining one. The satisfied overlords help you
repair your ship and you prepare for takeoff. Allowed one final question, you ask
Tee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers "ozo." Too bad you still don't know 
what that means.

**Transcript**:
Created by logician Raymond Smullyan and popularized by his colleague
George Boolos, this riddle has been called the hardest
logic puzzle ever. You and your team have crash-landed
on an ancient planet. The only way off is to appease
its three alien overlords, Tee, Eff, and Arr, by giving them the correct artifacts. Unfortunately, you don't
know who is who. From an inscription, you learn that you
may ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord. Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time. But there's a problem. You've deciphered the language enough
to ask any question, but you don't know which of the two
words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no. How can you still figure out 
which alien is which? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,
but downright impossible. What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer
nor know if it's true? But it can be done. The key is to carefully formulate
our questions so that any answer 
yields useful information. First of all, we can get around
to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves
in the questions, and secondly, if we load each question
with a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not
won't actually matter. To see how that could work, imagine our question
is whether two plus two is four. Instead of posing it directly, we say, "If I asked you whether
two plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?" If 'ozo' means yes 
and the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, "ozo." But what if we ask Eff? Well, it would answer "ulu,"
or no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to 
our embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons. If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure. A double positive and a double negative
both result in a positive. Now, we can be sure that asking
either Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo'
if the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what 
each word actually means. Unfortunately, 
this doesn't help us with Arr. But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr. Then we can use the second to find out
whether its Tee or Eff. And once we know that, we can ask it to identify 
one of the others. So let's begin. Ask the alien in the middle, "If I asked you whether the overlord on
my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?" If the reply is 'ozo,' 
there are two possibilities. You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined

**Transcript**:
Sometime in the early 1750s, a 22-year-old man named
Benjamin Banneker sat industriously carving cogs
and gears out of wood. He pieced the parts together to create the complex inner working
of a striking clock that would, hopefully, 
chime every hour. All he had to help him was 
a pocket watch for inspiration and his own calculations. And yet, his careful engineering worked. Striking clocks had already been
around for hundreds of years, but Banneker's may have been
the first created in America, and it drew fascinated visitors from
across the country. In a show of his brilliance, the clock continued to chime
for the rest of Banneker's life. Born in 1731 to freed slaves
on a farm in Baltimore, Maryland, from his earliest days, the young Banneker was obsessed
with math and science. And his appetite for knowledge only grew
as he taught himself astronomy, mathematics, engineering, and the study of the natural world. As an adult, he used astronomy
to accurately predict lunar and solar events, like the solar eclipse of 1789, and even applied his mathematical skills
to land use planning. These talents caught the eye of a local
Baltimore businessman, Andrew Ellicott, who was also the Surveyor General
of the United States. Recognizing Banneker's skills in 1791, Ellicott appointed him as an assistant
to work on a prestigious new project, planning the layout 
of the nation's capitol. Meanwhile, Banneker turned 
his brilliant mind to farming. He used his scientific expertise
to pioneer new agricultural methods on his family's tobacco farm. His fascination with the natural world also led to a study on the plague
life cycle of locusts. Then in 1792, Banneker 
began publishing almanacs. These provided detailed annual information
on moon and sun cycles, weather forecasts, and planting and tidal time tables. Banneker sent a handwritten copy
of his first almanac to Virginia's Secretary of State
Thomas Jefferson. This was a decade before Jefferson
became president. Banneker included a letter imploring
Jefferson to "embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd 
and false ideas and opinions" that caused prejudice 
against black people. Jefferson read the almanac and wrote
back in praise of Banneker's work. Banneker's correspondence with 
the future president is now considered to be one of the first
documented examples of a civil rights 
protest letter in America. For the rest of his life,
he fought for this cause, sharing his opposition to slavery
through his writing. In 1806 at the age of 75, Banneker died after a lifetime
of study and activism. On the day of his funeral,
his house mysteriously burned down, and the majority of his life's work, including his striking clock, 
was destroyed. But still, his legacy lives on.

around for hundreds of years, but Banneker's may have been
the first created in America, and it drew fascinated visitors from
across the country. In a show of his brilliance, the clock continued to chime
for the rest of Banneker's life. Born in 1731 to freed slaves
on a farm in Baltimore, Maryland, from his earliest days, the young Banneker was obsessed
with math and science. And his appetite for knowledge only grew
as he taught himself astronomy, mathematics, engineering, and the study of the natural world. As an adult, he used astronomy
to accurately predict lunar and solar events, like the solar eclipse of 1789, and even applied his mathematical skills
to land use planning. These talents caught the eye of a local
Baltimore businessman, Andrew Ellicott, who was also the Surveyor General
of the United States. Recognizing Banneker's skills in 1791, Ellicott appointed him as an assistant
to work on a prestigious new project, planning the layout 
of the nation's capitol. Meanwhile, Banneker turned 
his brilliant mind to farming. He used his scientific expertise
to pioneer new agricultural methods on his family's tobacco farm. His fascination with the natural world also led to a study on the plague
life cycle of locusts. Then in 1792, Banneker 
began publishing almanacs. These provided detailed annual information
on moon and sun cycles, weather forecasts, and planting and tidal time tables. Banneker sent a handwritten copy
of his first almanac to Virginia's Secretary of State
Thomas Jefferson. This was a decade before Jefferson
became president. Banneker included a letter imploring
Jefferson to "embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd 
and false ideas and opinions" that caused prejudice 
against black people. Jefferson read the almanac and wrote
back in praise of Banneker's work. Banneker's correspondence with 
the future president is now considered to be one of the first
documented examples of a civil rights 
protest letter in America. For the rest of his life,
he fought for this cause, sharing his opposition to slavery
through his writing. In 1806 at the age of 75, Banneker died after a lifetime
of study and activism. On the day of his funeral,
his house mysteriously burned down, and the majority of his life's work, including his striking clock, 
was destroyed. But still, his legacy lives on.

**Transcript**:
Humans have done a pretty good job of exploring
the Earth thus far, climbing mountains and crossing continents and planting our flags
all over the place in the name of science. But one part of the world that has remained pretty
mysterious to us also happens to cover more than 70% of its surface: the ocean. Yes , we’ve sailed across it plenty of times.
And drilled for oil in it. And managed to create reality shows about fishing in it. But, from glowing oceans to massive deep-sea
creatures, and underwater ecosystems with thousands of undiscovered, basically-alien
species -- we still have a lot to learn about it. Probably more than any place on Earth, the
ocean is full of fascinating stuff that we just don’t know. Not yet. [Music Playing] Number One: What’s the ocean floor like? Fact is, we still don’t know exactly what
the ocean floor looks like in most places. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
says that 95% of the ocean's bottom remains unseen by humans. As a result, we have a way better picture of the surfaces of other planets than we do of most of the seafloor. In 2014, a team of scientists created a map
of the seafloor using data from satellites equipped with special sensors called radar
altimeters. These instruments could precisely measure the distance from the satellite to the surface of the ocean below. Essentially, any large mountains or canyons
on the ocean floor have a slight gravitational effect on the ocean surface, creating bumps and dips, respectively. These variations are of course too subtle to be detected by human eyes, but they can be measured by these ultra-precise satellite altimeters
-- and, after adjusting for the effect of waves and tides, tell scientists what’s
on the seafloor. This map spans the entire ocean floor, which is awesome, and we’re all glad that it exists, but it only has a resolution of about 5 kilometers, which is pretty low. By comparison, most of the surface of Mars, Venus, and the Moon have been mapped to resolutions of 100 meters or less. So, if we want to know what’s going on down there and really explore the ocean, detecting life, specific mineral formations, or wrecks, we’re gonna need a better map. Number Two: What’s under the seafloor? OK, probably thinking that you know what’s
down there: rock. Yes. But not just rock. In 2015, scientists reported that they had
drilled down about 2 and a half kilometers below the seafloor off the coast of Japan,
and discovered living microbes. There were only about 10 to 10,000 microorganisms
in a cubic centimeter of sediment that they studied, compared to like billions that you’d
find in the same amount of dirt from your garden. But still: There's life down there, even
in the intense heat and pressure many kilometers below where the ocean stops. And the genomes of these under-sea microbes
showed that they were actually more similar to the kind you’d find in forest soil, rather
than the ones in seafloor sediments. So it’s possible that these microbes are
descendants of terrestrial ones from 20 million years ago, that just adapted when their habitat
began to get buried way beneath the ocean. So, who knows what other kinds of life could
exist in deep marine sediments, or what they could tell us about what life on Earth used to be like? Number Three: Brine pools. We’ve all seen lakes and rivers on land,
but what about lakes that are … underwater? Sounds a little bit unreal, like maybe it’s from a Sponge Bob episode but these features actually exist -- pockets of seawater that have a different
composition than the surrounding ocean: because they’re super salty. They’re known as brine pools, and they seem
to have formed when layers of salt from evaporated oceans millions of years ago got buried under
layers of sediment. Seawater can reach these deposits and mix
with the salt, forming a dense brine that flows out of the seafloor, sometimes filled
with oils or methane gas. Some brine pools, like those found deep in
the Gulf of Mexico, are four times as salty as the ocean water around it. And the brine is so dense that submersibles
can even “float” on top of it, like a boat on a lake. All of this salt makes brine pools lethal
to larger animals. But colonies of halophilic -- or salt-loving
-- microorganisms can flourish there, usually in much higher concentrations than the nearby
normal seawater. Some pools are even lined with mussels that
have symbiotic bacteria in their gills, which use the methane in the brine to make energy
for the mussels. But there’s a ton that we don’t know about
these weird underwater salt lakes -- like how brine pools can be so different from each
other -- and why some have mussels and others don’t -- and even how many there are! Number Four: Milky seas. Also known as mareel, this is a
phenomenon in which thousands of square kilometers of the ocean’s surface glow a brilliant
whitish-blue. It lasts for such a short time, and there
have been so few recorded sightings, that these glowing seas were thought to be a myth
made up by crazy sailors… … until 2005 -- when a group of researchers
was studying satellite pictures of a swath of the Indian Ocean from 1995. These pictures showed an area of about 15,000 kilometers-square, around the size of Connecticut, glowing for 3 nights. It was the first scientific evidence of the
phenomenon, but the glowing waters are still not very well understood. Some have suggested that the glow is caused by a mass of tiny dinoflagellates called Noctiluca scintillans known as “sea sparkles” for the way they glow when disturbed. These protists are what cause the picturesque
glittering waves along coastlines in some parts of the world. But the 2005 study found that it was “unlikely,
if not impossible” that the short-lived glowing of dinoflagellates was what scientists had been seeing from space. The prevailing theory these days is that milky
seas are caused by massive colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that are growing on top of an algal
bloom. But we’re still not sure how or why these
ephemeral masses of bacteria gather, glow, and disappear. Number Five: The 52 hertz whale. You’d think we would know a lot about whales. I mean, they’re big, and we have their skeletons,
and we can observe their migratory patterns. But one thing we still have a lot more to learn about is their songs -- from why some whales make them, to how an animal without vocal
cords … or lips … manages to make song-like sounds. And then there’s this question -- what whale
is producing the 52 hertz song, and why? This whale song was first noted by a technician
on December 7th, 1992 in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. It sounded like a blue whale, but blue whale
cries usually are somewhere between 15 and 20 hertz in pitch. So, blue whales in the Pacific typically sound
like this: [Blue Whale Cry Playing] But this whale song, played at the same speed,
sounded like this: [52 Hertz Song Playing] This high-pitch noise seemed to be unique
to one animal -- a whale that became known as 52 Blue. This raises a lot of questions, and we have
to know more about whales to be able to answer some of them, like, why does this one whale sound different? And can others even hear it? And if they can hear it, do they understand? Some people latched onto to the idea that
52 Blue is a lonely whale crying out to others that might not hear it or wouldn’t call
back. But several scientists have rejected this
lonely narrative, and think that other whales may be able to understand its call, even if
they can’t make that call themselves. Also, 52 blue seems to migrate independently
from any other whales. But its migratory patterns do look kind
of like those of blue whales -- scientists have been tracking it up and down the North
Pacific from Alaska to Mexico for years now. So some researchers think it might have some
malformation that has changed how it sings, or maybe it’s even a hybrid between a blue
whale and another species. Whether or not it’s a lonely whale, 52 Blue
is an oddity that people seem to love. Number Six: Upsweep. Now, ocean sounds are practically their own
field of study, NOAA has been monitoring acoustics in the ocean for decades now. Instead of microphones, which are used to
collect sound in air, NOAA uses hydrophones to record underwater sounds. Mostly, these hydrophones are used to listen
to the ambient sound of the ocean, to see how humans might interfere with it, and to listen for things like earthquakes and whale calls. And sometimes, they record things that are
hard to explain, at least for a while. In 1997, for example, there was what was known
as The Bloop, an extremely loud, low-frequency sound heard by hydrophones some 5,000 kilometers
apart. Oceanographers recently determined that it
was the result of an icequake -- the cracking and collapse of glaciers into the ocean, in
this case on the coast of Antarctica. But there’s another mystery sound from the
ocean, known as Upsweep. Recorded in August 1991, it sounds like a
repeating “boop” that picks up at the end -- sweeping up -- kind of like the “red
alert” sound effect you hear on spaceships in sci-fi movies. But instead of trying to describe it, I could just play it for you. [Boop Playing] Since 1991, this sound has been heard regularly
in the Pacific Ocean, and it seems to be seasonal, usually becoming more common in spring and
fall. Researchers have tracked the sound to a part
of the Pacific that has lots of volcanic and seismic activity, which seem to be important
clues. But according to NOAA, “the origin of the
sound is unresolved.” Number Seven: Why are deep-sea creatures so
huge? From the Kraken to sea dragons, all of our
favorite mythical sea monsters are gigantic. And the fact is, in real life, many deep-sea
creatures are unusually huge. This phenomenon is called deep-sea gigantism. But what drives it is … you guessed it!
… unknown! In the deep sea, and especially near the polar
oceans, some animals seem to get really huge -- like colossal squids, giant isopods, and
Japanese spider crabs. Scientists aren’t sure why, but they do have some guesses. There’s Bergmann’s Rule, for example,
which suggests that temperature may influence gigantism. This might be because larger animals have
less surface area relative to volume, so they radiate less heat based on their mass and
stay warmer in colder climates. And then there’s Klieber’s Law,
which states that more massive animals generally have lower metabolic rates -- and therefore
need less high-quality food --- to survive. Still other theories suggest that gigantism
may help organisms resist increased pressure of the deep sea. But we don’t really have conclusive biological
reasons why these giant creatures exist. So, the ocean is just full o’ mysteries,
maybe because it’s so huge and dark and deep. But just so you know that we’re not hyping
you -- we’re not saying that these 7 topics are things that Science Can’t Explain. Instead, you should just think of them as reminders of how much we still have to learn about the ocean. As our technology improves, and our access
to the ocean takes us to new depths, we’ll be able to see and hear and sample more stuff than we ever have before. So in time, these puzzles will be solved,
and new creatures will be discovered, and our understanding of our planet, and the life
on it, will be that much … deeper. Thank you for watching this SciShow List Show, and thanks especially to all of our patrons on Patreon who make this show possible. If you want to help us keep making shows like this, you can go to patreon.com/scishow­. And

And drilled for oil in it. And managed to create reality shows about fishing in it. But, from glowing oceans to massive deep-sea
creatures, and underwater ecosystems with thousands of undiscovered, basically-alien
species -- we still have a lot to learn about it. Probably more than any place on Earth, the
ocean is full of fascinating stuff that we just don’t know. Not yet. [Music Playing] Number One: What’s the ocean floor like? Fact is, we still don’t know exactly what
the ocean floor looks like in most places. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
says that 95% of the ocean's bottom remains unseen by humans. As a result, we have a way better picture of the surfaces of other planets than we do of most of the seafloor. In 2014, a team of scientists created a map
of the seafloor using data from satellites equipped with special sensors called radar
altimeters. These instruments could precisely measure the distance from the satellite to the surface of the ocean below. Essentially, any large mountains or canyons
on the ocean floor have a slight gravitational effect on the ocean surface, creating bumps and dips, respectively. These variations are of course too subtle to be detected by human eyes, but they can be measured by these ultra-precise satellite altimeters
-- and, after adjusting for the effect of waves and tides, tell scientists what’s
on the seafloor. This map spans the entire ocean floor, which is awesome, and we’re all glad that it exists, but it only has a resolution of about 5 kilometers, which is pretty low. By comparison, most of the surface of Mars, Venus, and the Moon have been mapped to resolutions of 100 meters or less. So, if we want to know what’s going on down there and really explore the ocean, detecting life, specific mineral formations, or wrecks, we’re gonna need a better map. Number Two: What’s under the seafloor? OK, probably thinking that you know what’s
down there: rock. Yes. But not just rock. In 2015, scientists reported that they had
drilled down about 2 and a half kilometers below the seafloor off the coast of Japan,
and discovered living microbes. There were only about 10 to 10,000 microorganisms
in a cubic centimeter of sediment that they studied, compared to like billions that you’d
find in the same amount of dirt from your garden. But still: There's life down there, even
in the intense heat and pressure many kilometers below where the ocean stops. And the genomes of these under-sea microbes
showed that they were actually more similar to the kind you’d find in forest soil, rather
than the ones in seafloor sediments. So it’s possible that these microbes are
descendants of terrestrial ones from 20 million years ago, that just adapted when their habitat
began to get buried way beneath the ocean. So, who knows what other kinds of life could
exist in deep marine sediments, or what they could tell us about what life on Earth used to be like? Number Three: Brine pools. We’ve all seen lakes and rivers on land,
but what about lakes that are … underwater? Sounds a little bit unreal, like maybe it’s from a Sponge Bob episode but these features actually exist -- pockets of seawater that have a different
composition than the surrounding ocean: because they’re super salty. They’re known as brine pools, and they seem
to have formed when layers of salt from evaporated oceans millions of years ago got buried under
layers of sediment. Seawater can reach these deposits and mix
with the salt, forming a dense brine that flows out of the seafloor, sometimes filled
with oils or methane gas. Some brine pools, like those found deep in
the Gulf of Mexico, are four times as salty as the ocean water around it. And the brine is so dense that submersibles
can even “float” on top of it, like a boat on a lake. All of this salt makes brine pools lethal
to larger animals. But colonies of halophilic -- or salt-loving
-- microorganisms can flourish there, usually in much higher concentrations than the nearby
normal seawater. Some pools are even lined with mussels that
have symbiotic bacteria in their gills, which use the methane in the brine to make energy
for the mussels. But there’s a ton that we don’t know about
these weird underwater salt lakes -- like how brine pools can be so different from each
other -- and why some have mussels and others don’t -- and even how many there are! Number Four: Milky seas. Also known as mareel, this is a
phenomenon in which thousands of square kilometers of the ocean’s surface glow a brilliant
whitish-blue. It lasts for such a short time, and there
have been so few recorded sightings, that these glowing seas were thought to be a myth
made up by crazy sailors… … until 2005 -- when a group of researchers
was studying satellite pictures of a swath of the Indian Ocean from 1995. These pictures showed an area of about 15,000 kilometers-square, around the size of Connecticut, glowing for 3 nights. It was the first scientific evidence of the
phenomenon, but the glowing waters are still not very well understood. Some have suggested that the glow is caused by a mass of tiny dinoflagellates called Noctiluca scintillans known as “sea sparkles” for the way they glow when disturbed. These protists are what cause the picturesque
glittering waves along coastlines in some parts of the world. But the 2005 study found that it was “unlikely,
if not impossible” that the short-lived glowing of dinoflagellates was what scientists had been seeing from space. The prevailing theory these days is that milky
seas are caused by massive colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that are growing on top of an algal
bloom. But we’re still not sure how or why these
ephemeral masses of bacteria gather, glow, and disappear. Number Five: The 52 hertz whale. You’d think we would know a lot about whales. I mean, they’re big, and we have their skeletons,
and we can observe their migratory patterns. But one thing we still have a lot more to learn about is their songs -- from why some whales make them, to how an animal without vocal
cords … or lips … manages to make song-like sounds. And then there’s this question -- what whale
is producing the 52 hertz song, and why? This whale song was first noted by a technician
on December 7th, 1992 in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. It sounded like a blue whale, but blue whale
cries usually are somewhere between 15 and 20 hertz in pitch. So, blue whales in the Pacific typically sound
like this: [Blue Whale Cry Playing] But this whale song, played at the same speed,
sounded like this: [52 Hertz Song Playing] This high-pitch noise seemed to be unique
to one animal -- a whale that became known as 52 Blue. This raises a lot of questions, and we have
to know more about whales to be able to answer some of them, like, why does this one whale sound different? And can others even hear it? And if they can hear it, do they understand? Some people latched onto to the idea that
52 Blue is a lonely whale crying out to others that might not hear it or wouldn’t call
back. But several scientists have rejected this
lonely narrative, and think that other whales may be able to understand its call, even if
they can’t make that call themselves. Also, 52 blue seems to migrate independently
from any other whales. But its migratory patterns do look kind
of like those of blue whales -- scientists have been tracking it up and down the North
Pacific from Alaska to Mexico for years now. So some researchers think it might have some
malformation that has changed how it sings, or maybe it’s even a hybrid between a blue
whale and another species. Whether or not it’s a lonely whale, 52 Blue
is an oddity that people seem to love. Number Six: Upsweep. Now, ocean sounds are practically their own
field of study, NOAA has been monitoring acoustics in the ocean for decades now. Instead of microphones, which are used to
collect sound in air, NOAA uses hydrophones to record underwater sounds. Mostly, these hydrophones are used to listen
to the ambient sound of the ocean, to see how humans might interfere with it, and to listen for things like earthquakes and whale calls. And sometimes, they record things that are
hard to explain, at least for a while. In 1997, for example, there was what was known
as The Bloop, an extremely loud, low-frequency sound heard by hydrophones some 5,000 kilometers
apart. Oceanographers recently determined that it
was the result of an icequake -- the cracking and collapse of glaciers into the ocean, in
this case on the coast of Antarctica. But there’s another mystery sound from the
ocean, known as Upsweep. Recorded in August 1991, it sounds like a
repeating “boop” that picks up at the end -- sweeping up -- kind of like the “red
alert” sound effect you hear on spaceships in sci-fi movies. But instead of trying to describe it, I could just play it for you. [Boop Playing] Since 1991, this sound has been heard regularly
in the Pacific Ocean, and it seems to be seasonal, usually becoming more common in spring and
fall. Researchers have tracked the sound to a part
of the Pacific that has lots of volcanic and seismic activity, which seem to be important
clues. But according to NOAA, “the origin of the
sound is unresolved.” Number Seven: Why are deep-sea creatures so
huge? From the Kraken to sea dragons, all of our
favorite mythical sea monsters are gigantic. And the fact is, in real life, many deep-sea
creatures are unusually huge. This phenomenon is called deep-sea gigantism. But what drives it is … you guessed it!
… unknown! In the deep sea, and especially near the polar
oceans, some animals seem to get really huge -- like colossal squids, giant isopods, and
Japanese spider crabs. Scientists aren’t sure why, but they do have some guesses. There’s Bergmann’s Rule, for example,
which suggests that temperature may influence gigantism. This might be because larger animals have
less surface area relative to volume, so they radiate less heat based on their mass and
stay warmer in colder climates. And then there’s Klieber’s Law,
which states that more massive animals generally have lower metabolic rates -- and therefore
need less high-quality food --- to survive. Still other theories suggest that gigantism
may help organisms resist increased pressure of the deep sea. But we don’t really have conclusive biological
reasons why these giant creatures exist. So, the ocean is just full o’ mysteries,
maybe because it’s so huge and dark and deep. But just so you know that we’re not hyping
you -- we’re not saying that these 7 topics are things that Science Can’t Explain. Instead, you should just think of them as reminders of how much we still have to learn about the ocean. As our technology improves, and our access
to the ocean takes us to new depths, we’ll be able to see and hear and sample more stuff than we ever have before. So in time, these puzzles will be solved,
and new creatures will be discovered, and our understanding of our planet, and the life
on it, will be that much … deeper. Thank you for watching this SciShow List Show, and thanks especially to all of our patrons on Patreon who make this show possible. If you want to help us keep making shows like this, you can go to patreon.com/scishow­. And

Humans have done a pretty good job of exploring
the Earth thus far, climbing mountains and crossing continents and planting our flags

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're walking through a forest. Everything might seem quiet...but beneath
your feet is a flurry of conversation. All the plants around you are actually talking
to each other. The trees and the shrubs and the flowers are
passing information back and forth, with serious life and death consequences. So, how are they communicating? They’re using a giant network of fungi—one
so pervasive and powerful that some scientists have started comparing it to the Internet. They’re calling it the “Wood Wide Web.” I’m Anna, and this is Gross Science. The so-called Wood Wide Web is made up of
what are called “mycorrhizal fungi.” There are many different types of mycorrhizal
fungi, but generally these little guys will grow on the roots of plants and provide them
with water and nutrients—like nitrogen and phosphorus—in exchange for sugars from the
plant. While they’re incredibly thin, the threads
of the fungi can be up to 1000 times the length of a tree root. This allows the fungi to connect together
many different plants. Once connections are made, the fungi can act
almost like the neurons in our brain, transporting signals from plant to plant. And these networks are everywhere. It’s estimated that around 90% of land plants
are connected to some kind of mycorrhizal network. So, how can plants use these networks? Well, to begin with, they can help each other
out in times of stress. For example, during the fall months, when
paper birch trees lose their leaves and can’t produce sugar, Douglas-fir trees may shuttle
them nutrients through the fungal network. And in the summer, when paper birch trees
have lots of leaves, they send sugars to young Douglas-fir saplings growing in their shadows. Plants can also warn each other of danger. Douglas-fir trees connected by a fungal network
can alert their ponderosa pine neighbors if they’re attacked by budworms. In response, the neighboring ponderosa pine
trees will produce insect-repelling chemicals—even though they haven’t been directly exposed
to the insects themselves. Mycorrhizal fungi can also enable parental
care of among plants. Some adult trees will help out their younger
relatives by sending those seedlings more nutrients through the fungal network than
they send to strangers. The adults may even make more room for them
in the soil by reducing the number of their own roots. But not everyone is so generous. Much like our internet, things can sometimes
get a little nasty on the Wood Wide Web. Take Black Walnut trees, for example. They can spread poison through the network,
hindering the growth of their neighbors. And the fungi making up the network can be
just as tricky. Mycorrhizal fungi tend to pick favorites. They may share resources with one species
of tree, but bleed another species dry without giving anything back in return. The fungi may also judge a plant's health. If they think it’s too weak or sick, they
may not allow it to receive nutrients or danger signals from the network. Now, we’re only beginning to understand
how complex these relationships get. But imagine the possibilities for agriculture
and forestry. If we find out certain species share well
across the network, maybe we can plant them near each other to yield better harvests,
or grow healthier forests. So next time you’re walking through the
woods or the park don’t forget to thank the fungal web beneath your feet. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're walking through a forest. Everything might seem quiet...but beneath
your feet is a flurry of conversation. All the plants around you are actually talking
to each other. The trees and the shrubs and the flowers are
passing information back and forth, with serious life and death consequences. So, how are they communicating? They’re using a giant network of fungi—one
so pervasive and powerful that some scientists have started comparing it to the Internet. They’re calling it the “Wood Wide Web.” I’m Anna, and this is Gross Science. The so-called Wood Wide Web is made up of
what are called “mycorrhizal fungi.” There are many different types of mycorrhizal
fungi, but generally these little guys will grow on the roots of plants and provide them
with water and nutrients—like nitrogen and phosphorus—in exchange for sugars from the
plant. While they’re incredibly thin, the threads
of the fungi can be up to 1000 times the length of a tree root. This allows the fungi to connect together
many different plants. Once connections are made, the fungi can act
almost like the neurons in our brain, transporting signals from plant to plant. And these networks are everywhere. It’s estimated that around 90% of land plants
are connected to some kind of mycorrhizal network. So, how can plants use these networks? Well, to begin with, they can help each other
out in times of stress. For example, during the fall months, when
paper birch trees lose their leaves and can’t produce sugar, Douglas-fir trees may shuttle
them nutrients through the fungal network. And in the summer, when paper birch trees
have lots of leaves, they send sugars to young Douglas-fir saplings growing in their shadows. Plants can also warn each other of danger. Douglas-fir trees connected by a fungal network
can alert their ponderosa pine neighbors if they’re attacked by budworms. In response, the neighboring ponderosa pine
trees will produce insect-repelling chemicals—even though they haven’t been directly exposed
to the insects themselves. Mycorrhizal fungi can also enable parental
care of among plants. Some adult trees will help out their younger
relatives by sending those seedlings more nutrients through the fungal network than
they send to strangers. The adults may even make more room for them
in the soil by reducing the number of their own roots. But not everyone is so generous. Much like our internet, things can sometimes
get a little nasty on the Wood Wide Web. Take Black Walnut trees, for example. They can spread poison through the network,
hindering the growth of their neighbors. And the fungi making up the network can be
just as tricky. Mycorrhizal fungi tend to pick favorites. They may share resources with one species
of tree, but bleed another species dry without giving anything back in return. The fungi may also judge a plant's health. If they think it’s too weak or sick, they
may not allow it to receive nutrients or danger signals from the network. Now, we’re only beginning to understand
how complex these relationships get. But imagine the possibilities for agriculture
and forestry. If we find out certain species share well
across the network, maybe we can plant them near each other to yield better harvests,
or grow healthier forests. So next time you’re walking through the
woods or the park don’t forget to thank the fungal web beneath your feet. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Shall I ask for a show
of hands or a clapping of people in different generations? I'm interested in how many
are three to 12 years old. (Laughter) None, huh? (Laughter) All right. I'm going to talk about dinosaurs. Do you remember dinosaurs
when you were that age? (Applause) Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know. (Laughter) We're going to kind of go
in a different direction right now. I hope you all realize that. So I'll just give you my message up front: Try not to go extinct. (Laughter) That's it. (Laughter) People ask me a lot -- in fact, one of the most asked
questions I get is, why do children
like dinosaurs so much? What's the fascination? And I usually just say, "Well, dinosaurs were big, different and gone." They're all gone. Well that's not true, but we'll get to the goose in a minute. So that's sort of the theme: big, different and gone. The title of my talk: Shape-shifting Dinosaurs: The cause of a premature extinction. Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs. And there's lots of different shapes. Lots of different kinds. A long time ago, back in the early 1900s,
museums were out looking for dinosaurs. They went out and gathered them up. And this is an interesting story. Every museum wanted a little bigger
or better one than anybody else had. So if the museum in Toronto went out
and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one, then the museum in Ottawa
wanted a bigger one, and a better one. And that happened for all museums. So everyone was out looking
for all these bigger and better dinosaurs. And this was in the early 1900s. By about 1970, some scientists were sitting around
and they thought, "What in the world -- Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big. Where are all the little ones?" (Laughter) And they thought about it
and they even wrote papers about it: "Where are the little dinosaurs?" (Laughter) Well, go to a museum, you'll see, see how many baby dinosaurs there are. People assumed --
and this was actually a problem -- people assumed
that if they had little dinosaurs, if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
they'd be easy to identify. You'd have a big dinosaur
and a littler dinosaur. (Laughter) But all they had were big dinosaurs. And it comes down to a couple of things. First off, scientists have egos, and scientists like to name dinosaurs. They like to name anything. Everybody likes to have
their own animal that they named. (Laughter) And so every time they found something
that looked a little different, they named it something different. And what happened, of course, is we ended up with a whole
bunch of different dinosaurs. In 1975, a light went on in somebody's head. Dr. Peter Dodson
at the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do, which is different
than the way reptiles grow. And in fact, he used the cassowary as an example. And it's kind of cool --
if you look at the cassowary, or any of the birds
that have crests on their heads, they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow. Now think about that. They're basically retaining
their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny. So allometric cranial ontogeny
is relative skull growth. So you can see that if you actually found
one that was 80 percent grown and you didn't know that it was going
to grow up to a cassowary, you would think
they were two different animals. So this was a problem, and Peter Dodson pointed this out
using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus. And he showed that if you were to take
a baby and an adult and make an average
of what it should look like, if it grew in sort of a linear fashion, it would have a crest
about half the size of the adult. But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all. So this was interesting. So this is where people went astray again. I mean, if they'd have just taken that, taken Peter Dodson's work,
and gone on with that, then we would have a lot less
dinosaurs than we have. But scientists have egos;
they like to name things. And so they went on naming dinosaurs
because they were different. Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
is a young one or an older one. And that's by actually
cutting into their bones. But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
is hard to do, as you can imagine, because in museums, bones are precious. You go into a museum,
and they take really good care of them. They put them in foam, little containers. They're very well taken care of. They don't like it if you come in
and want to saw them open and look inside. (Laughter) So they don't normally let you do that. (Laughter) But I have a museum
and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open. So that's what I do. (Applause) So if you cut open a little dinosaur, it's very spongy inside, like A. And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
it's very massive. You can tell it's mature bone. So it's real easy to tell them apart. So what I want to do is show you these. In North America in the northern plains
of the United States and the southern plains
of Alberta and Saskatchewan, there's this unit of rock
called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth. And there are 12 of them
that everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
that went extinct. And so we will evaluate them. And that's sort of what I've been doing. So my students, my staff,
we've been cutting them open. Now as you can imagine,
cutting open a leg bone is one thing, but when you go to a museum and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?" they say, "Go away." (Laughter) So here are 12 dinosaurs. And we want to look at these three first. So these are dinosaurs
that are called Pachycephalosaurus. And everybody knows
that these three animals are related. And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever. But no one ever considered
that they might be more closely related. In other words, people looked at them
and they saw the differences. And you all know
that if you are going to determine whether you're related
to your brother or your sister, you can't do it by looking at differences. You can only determine relatedness
by looking for similarities. So people were looking at these and they were talking
about how different they are. Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
thick dome on its head, and it's got some little bumps
on the back of its head, and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
on the end of its nose. And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
from the same age, lived at the same time, has spikes sticking out
the back of its head. It's got a little, tiny dome, and it's got a bunch
of gnarly stuff on its nose. And then there's this thing
called Dracorex hogwartsia. Guess where that came from? Dragon. So here's a dinosaur that has spikes
sticking out of its head, no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose. Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff
sort of looked alike. But they did look at these three and they said, "These
are three different dinosaurs, and Dracorex is probably
the most primitive of them. And the other one
is more primitive than the other." It's unclear to me how they actually
sorted these three of them out. But if you line them up, if you just take those three skulls
and just line them up, they line up like this. Dracorex is the littlest one, Stygimoloch is the middle-size one, Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. And one would think,
that should give me a clue. (Laughter) But it didn't give them a clue. (Laughter) Because, well we know why. Scientists like to name things. So if we cut open Dracorex -- I cut open our Dracorex -- and look, it was spongy inside,
really spongy inside. I mean, it is a juvenile
and it's growing really fast. So it is going to get bigger. If you cut open Stygimoloch,
it is doing the same thing. The dome, that little dome,
is growing really fast. It's inflating very fast. What's interesting is the spike
on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well. The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing, which means they're getting smaller
as that dome is getting bigger. And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back
of its head were also resorbing. So just with these three dinosaurs, as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series
of the same animal. Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct. (Laughter) OK. (Laughter) Which of course means
we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with. So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --
he and I were looking at Triceratops. And before the year 2000 -- now remember, Triceratops was first
found in the 1800s -- before 2000, no one had ever seen
a juvenile Triceratops. There's a Triceratops
in every museum in the world, but no one had ever collected a juvenile. And we know why, right? Because everybody wants to have a big one. So everyone had a big one. So we went out and collected
a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones. They're everywhere,
they're all over the place. So we have a whole bunch
of them at our museum. (Laughter) And everybody says
it's because I have a little museum. When you have a little museum,
you have little dinosaurs. (Laughter) If you look at the Triceratops, you can see it's changing,
it's shape-shifting. As the juveniles are growing up,
their horns actually curve backwards. And then as they get older,
the horns grow forward. And that's pretty cool. If you look along the edge of the frill, they have these little triangular bones
that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do
on the Pachycephalosaurs. And then, because the juveniles
are in my collection, I cut them open ... (Laughter) and look inside. And the little one is really spongy. And the middle-size one is really spongy. But what was interesting
was the adult Triceratops was also spongy. And this is a skull
that is two meters long. It's a big skull. But there's another dinosaur
that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops,
except it's bigger, and it's called Torosaurus. And Torosaurus, when we cut
into it, has mature bone. But it's got these big
holes in its shield. And everybody says, "A Triceratops and a Torosaurus
can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger
than the other one." (Laughter) "And it has holes in its frill." And I said, "Well do we have
any juvenile Torosauruses?" And they said, "Well, no,
but it has holes in its frill." So one of my graduate
students, John Scannella, looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole
starting to form in Triceratops and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones
between Triceratops and Torosaurus, which was pretty cool. So now we know that Torosaurus
is actually a grown-up Triceratops. Now when we name dinosaurs, when we name anything,
the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out. So Torosaurus is extinct. Triceratops, if you've heard the news,
a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong. They thought Torosaurus should be kept
and Triceratops thrown out, but that's not going to happen. (Laughter) All right, so we can do this
with a bunch of dinosaurs. I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. Anatotitan: giant duck. It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur. Here's another one. So we look at the bone histology. The bone histology tells us
that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile, or at least a subadult, and the other one is an adult,
and we have an ontogeny. And we get rid of Anatotitan. So we can just keep doing this. And the last one is T. Rex. So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus. (Laughter) Again, it makes you wonder. (Laughter) But they had a good question. They were looking at them and they said,
"One's got 17 teeth, and the biggest one's got 12 teeth. And that doesn't make any sense at all, because we don't know of any dinosaurs
that gain teeth as they get older. So it must be true -- they must be different." So we cut into them. And sure enough,
Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone. It looks like it could still get bigger. And at the Museum
of the Rockies where we work, I have four T. rexes,
so I can cut a whole bunch of them. But I didn't have to cut
any of them really, because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out
the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14. And of course, Nano has 17. And we just went out and looked
at other people's collections and we found one that has
sort of 15 teeth. So again, real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny
included Nanotyrannus, and therefore we can take out
another dinosaur. (Laughter) So when it comes down
to our end Cretaceous, we have seven left. And that's a good number. That's a good number
to go extinct, I think. Now as you can imagine, this is not very popular
with fourth-graders. (Laughter) Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,
they memorize them. And they're not happy with this. (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
What is bipolar disorder? The word bipolar means two extremes. For the many millions experiencing
bipolar disorder around the world, life is split between 
two different realities - elation and depression. Although there are many variations
of bipolar disorder, let's consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs
alongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, 
less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods
of depression. For someone seesawing between
emotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance
necessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1's extreme highs are known
as manic episodes, and they can make a person range from
feeling irritable to invincible. But these euphoric episodes exceed
ordinary feelings of joy, causing troubling symptoms 
like racing thoughts, sleeplessness, rapid speech, impuslive actions, and risky behaviors. Without treatment, these episodes
become more frequent, intense, and take longer to subside. The depressed phase of bipolar disorder
manifests in many ways - a low mood, dwindling interest in hobbies, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, restlessness or slowness, or persistent thoughts of suicide. Worldwide, about one 
to three percent of adults experience the broad range of symptoms
that indicate bipolar disorder. Most of those people are functional,
contributing members of society, and their lives, choices, 
and relationships aren't defined by the disorder, but still, for many, the consequences
are serious. The illness can undermine educational
and professional performance, relationships, financial security, and personal safety. So what causes bipolar disorder? Researchers think a key player is 
the brain's intricate wiring. Healthy brains maintain strong connections
between neurons thanks to the brain's continuous efforts
to prune itself and remove unused or faulty
neural connections. This process is important because our 
neural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network
that's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance
of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. But despite these insights, we can't pin
bipolar disorder down to a single cause. In reality, it's a complex problem. For example, the brain's amygdala
is involved in thinking, long-term memory, and emotional processing. In this brain region, factors as varied
as genetics and social trauma may create abnormalities and trigger
the symptoms of bipolar disorder. The condition tends to run in families, so we do know that genetics have
a lot to do with it. But that doesn't mean there's
a single bipolar gene. In fact, the likelihood of developing
bipolar disorder is driven by the interactions between
many genes in a complicated recipe we're still
trying to understand. The causes are complex, and consequently, diagnosing and living
with bipolar disorder is a challenge. Despite this, the disorder 
is controllable. Certain medications like lithium can help
manage risky thoughts and behaviors by stabilizing moods. These mood stabilizing medications work by
decreasing abnormal activity in the brain, thereby strengthening the viable
neural connections. Other frequently used medications
include antipsychotics, which alter the effects of dopamine, and electroconvulsive therapy, which works like a carefully controlled
seizure in the brain, is sometimes used as 
an emergency treatment. Some bipolar patients reject treatment because they're afraid it will
dim their emotions and destroy their creativity. But modern psychiatry is actively
trying to avoid that. Today, doctors work with patients
on a case-by-case basis to administer a combination of treatments
and therapies that allows them to live 
to their fullest possible potential. And beyond treatment, people with
bipolar disorder can benefit from even simpler changes. Those include regular exercise, good sleep habits, and sobriety from drugs and alcohol, not to mention the acceptance
and empathy of family and friends. Remember, bipolar disorder 
is a medical condition, not a person's fault, or their whole identity, and it's something that can be controlled through a combination of medical 
treatments doing their work internally, friends and family fostering acceptance
and understanding on the outside, and people with bipolar disorder 
empowering themselves to find balance in their lives.

**Transcript**:
What is bipolar disorder? The word bipolar means two extremes. For the many millions experiencing
bipolar disorder around the world, life is split between 
two different realities - elation and depression. Although there are many variations
of bipolar disorder, let's consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs
alongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, 
less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods
of depression. For someone seesawing between
emotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance
necessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1's extreme highs are known
as manic episodes, and they can make a person range from
feeling irritable to invincible. But these euphoric episodes exceed
ordinary feelings of joy, causing troubling symptoms 
like racing thoughts, sleeplessness, rapid speech, impuslive actions, and risky behaviors. Without treatment, these episodes
become more frequent, intense, and take longer to subside. The depressed phase of bipolar disorder
manifests in many ways - a low mood, dwindling interest in hobbies, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, restlessness or slowness, or persistent thoughts of suicide. Worldwide, about one 
to three percent of adults experience the broad range of symptoms
that indicate bipolar disorder. Most of those people are functional,
contributing members of society, and their lives, choices, 
and relationships aren't defined by the disorder, but still, for many, the consequences
are serious. The illness can undermine educational
and professional performance, relationships, financial security, and personal safety. So what causes bipolar disorder? Researchers think a key player is 
the brain's intricate wiring. Healthy brains maintain strong connections
between neurons thanks to the brain's continuous efforts
to prune itself and remove unused or faulty
neural connections. This process is important because our 
neural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network
that's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance
of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. But despite these insights, we can't pin
bipolar disorder down to a single cause. In reality, it's a complex problem. For example, the brain's amygdala
is involved in thinking, long-term memory, and emotional processing. In this brain region, factors as varied
as genetics and social trauma may create abnormalities and trigger
the symptoms of bipolar disorder. The condition tends to run in families, so we do know that genetics have
a lot to do with it. But that doesn't mean there's
a single bipolar gene. In fact, the likelihood of developing
bipolar disorder is driven by the interactions between
many genes in a complicated recipe we're still
trying to understand. The causes are complex, and consequently, diagnosing and living
with bipolar disorder is a challenge. Despite this, the disorder 
is controllable. Certain medications like lithium can help
manage risky thoughts and behaviors by stabilizing moods. These mood stabilizing medications work by
decreasing abnormal activity in the brain, thereby strengthening the viable
neural connections. Other frequently used medications
include antipsychotics, which alter the effects of dopamine, and electroconvulsive therapy, which works like a carefully controlled
seizure in the brain, is sometimes used as 
an emergency treatment. Some bipolar patients reject treatment because they're afraid it will
dim their emotions and destroy their creativity. But modern psychiatry is actively
trying to avoid that. Today, doctors work with patients
on a case-by-case basis to administer a combination of treatments
and therapies that allows them to live 
to their fullest possible potential. And beyond treatment, people with
bipolar disorder can benefit from even simpler changes. Those include regular exercise, good sleep habits, and sobriety from drugs and alcohol, not to mention the acceptance
and empathy of family and friends. Remember, bipolar disorder 
is a medical condition, not a person's fault, or their whole identity, and it's something that can be controlled through a combination of medical 
treatments doing their work internally, friends and family fostering acceptance
and understanding on the outside, and people with bipolar disorder 
empowering themselves to find balance in their lives.

and professional performance, relationships, financial security, and personal safety. So what causes bipolar disorder? Researchers think a key player is 
the brain's intricate wiring. Healthy brains maintain strong connections
between neurons thanks to the brain's continuous efforts
to prune itself and remove unused or faulty
neural connections. This process is important because our 
neural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network
that's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance
of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. But despite these insights, we can't pin
bipolar disorder down to a single cause. In reality, it's a complex problem. For example, the brain's amygdala
is involved in thinking, long-term memory, and emotional processing. In this brain region, factors as varied
as genetics and social trauma may create abnormalities and trigger
the symptoms of bipolar disorder. The condition tends to run in families, so we do know that genetics have
a lot to do with it. But that doesn't mean there's
a single bipolar gene. In fact, the likelihood of developing
bipolar disorder is driven by the interactions between
many genes in a complicated recipe we're still
trying to understand. The causes are complex, and consequently, diagnosing and living
with bipolar disorder is a challenge. Despite this, the disorder 
is controllable. Certain medications like lithium can help
manage risky thoughts and behaviors by stabilizing moods. These mood stabilizing medications work by
decreasing abnormal activity in the brain, thereby strengthening the viable
neural connections. Other frequently used medications
include antipsychotics, which alter the effects of dopamine, and electroconvulsive therapy, which works like a carefully controlled
seizure in the brain, is sometimes used as 
an emergency treatment. Some bipolar patients reject treatment because they're afraid it will
dim their emotions and destroy their creativity. But modern psychiatry is actively
trying to avoid that. Today, doctors work with patients
on a case-by-case basis to administer a combination of treatments
and therapies that allows them to live 
to their fullest possible potential. And beyond treatment, people with
bipolar disorder can benefit from even simpler changes. Those include regular exercise, good sleep habits, and sobriety from drugs and alcohol, not to mention the acceptance
and empathy of family and friends. Remember, bipolar disorder 
is a medical condition, not a person's fault, or their whole identity, and it's something that can be controlled through a combination of medical 
treatments doing their work internally, friends and family fostering acceptance
and understanding on the outside, and people with bipolar disorder 
empowering themselves to find balance in their lives.

**Transcript**:
I like chocolate a lot. This statement
comes as a surprise to absolutely no one in my life. And so every time a new
health claim about chocolate comes out in the news, I get
about five different emails in my inbox happily titled
about how chocolate is saving me from Alzheimer's and
lowering my blood pressure or keeping me skinny. So before we talk about how
you can sift through the hype to find the science and decide
what advice you are or are not going to take, let's
talk about chocolate. Chocolate begins as the seed
of the cacao tree, which is fermented and cleaned
and roasted and ground to create cocoa mass. The cocoa mass is then
liquefied and separated into cocoa solids
and cocoa butter. The ratio of cocoa solids to
other ingredients in chocolate is what gives us a
wide range of flavors. The darker the
chocolate, the greater the amount of cocoa solids. These solids contain
alkaloids like theobromine. Theobromine is a
bitter, mild stimulant with a very similar
shape to caffeine. This means that though
they are far, far milder, its effects on the body are very
similar to those of caffeine. So let's take a look at one
of the most recent chocolate health claims and see how
you can look at the science and sift through
all the media hype to find out what's
really underneath. In August, a review
of research was published that looked at
the link between chocolate and blood pressure. A summary of the review
is available online. And I'll link it here-ish so
that you can go look at it yourself. I got this link from
one of the news articles I was reading about the study. So it's something that
is readily available and that you can go
and hunt down yourself. So the review is titled Effect
of Cocoa on Blood Pressure. OK, that title makes sense. It says that researchers looked
at 856 different patients from 20 different
studies who were all given flavanol-containing
chocolate for trials ranging from two to 18 weeks. Here's where you
would have to do just a little bit of googling
to find out that flavanols are compounds found in chocolate
that have been linked to heart health. They found that
participants who were given flavanol-containing
cocoa products-- often dark chocolates-- had a
small but statistically significantly lowered
change in blood pressure. So that sounds OK-- more dark chocolate,
lower blood pressure. But if you read a little
deeper into the study, you find that they
know that they found these drops in
the two-week trials, but not in the longer trials. They also note that they
looked for correlations among subgroups that maybe
age played a role or sugar content of the chocolate
or baseline blood pressure, but that anything
they did find would have to be studied further. In some, researchers did
a review and said, hey, there might be something here. We should study this. But the media took this
and said, and I quote, "dark chocolate and cocoa powder
may help lower blood pressure." OK, "dark chocolate can
lower your blood pressure without weight gain,
says new study." And my personal favorite,
"prescription chocolate, study may sway some docs." Now, none of this is to
say that the study is wrong or to criticize the media-- OK, a little bit-- or to say that you
shouldn't eat chocolate. It's just to say
that sometimes it's good to look past the headlines
and do a little poking around in the science yourself. This way, you can make your
own informed decisions. And my decision? Go forth, do science.

**Transcript**:
"Order, order. So who do we have here?" "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen whose lurid affairs
destroyed two of Rome's finest generals and brought the end of the Republic." "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, one of the most powerful women in history whose reign brought Egypt nearly
22 years of stability and prosperity." "Uh, why don't we even know
what she looked like?" "Most of the art and descriptions
came long after her lifetime in the first century BCE, just like most of 
the things written about her." "So what do we actually know? Cleopatra VII was the last
of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian Greek family 
that governed Egypt after its conquest by Alexander the Great. She ruled jointly in Alexandria 
with her brother- to whom she was also married- until he had her exiled." "But what does all this 
have to do with Rome?" "Egypt had long been a Roman client state, and Cleopatra's father incurred 
large debts to the Republic. After being defeated by Julius Caesar
in Rome's civil war, the General Pompey sought refuge in Egypt but was executed 
by Cleopatra's brother instead." "Caesar must have liked that." "Actually, he found the murder unseemly
and demanded repayment of Egypt's debt. He could have annexed Egypt, but Cleopatra convinced him to restore
her to the throne instead." "We hear she was quite convincing." "And why not? Cleopatra 
was a fascinating woman. She commanded armies at 21, spoke several languages, and was educated in a city 
with the world's finest library and some of the greatest 
scholars of the time." "Hmm." "She kept Caesar lounging 
in Egypt for months when Rome needed him." "Caesar did more than lounge. He was fascinated by Egypt's culture
and knowledge, and he learned much during his time there. When he returned to Rome, 
he reformed the calendar, commissioned a census, made plans for a public library, and proposed many 
new infrastructure projects." "Yes, all very ambitious, 
exactly what got him assassinated." "Don't blame the Queen for Rome's
strange politics. Her job was ruling Egypt,
and she did it well. She stabilized the economy, managed the vast bureaucracy, and curbed corruption by priests
and officials. When drought hit, she opened
the granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's
stability and independence with no revolts during 
the rest of her reign." "So what went wrong?" "After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen
couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters." "Actually, it was the Roman factions who
came demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice
but to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar,
if only for the sake of their son." "And again, she provided her particular
kind of support to Marc Antony." "Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's 
countless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated
the relationships? And why are only powerful women
defined by their sexuality?" "Order." "Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic
with their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced
of their megalomania." "And yet Octavian was the one 
who attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman
in power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself." "How ironic." Cleopatra's story survived mainly
in the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps 
with rumors and stereotypes. We may never know the full truth
of her life and her reign, but we can separate fact from rumor
by putting history on trial.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
"Order, order. So who do we have here?" "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen whose lurid affairs
destroyed two of Rome's finest generals and brought the end of the Republic." "Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, one of the most powerful women in history whose reign brought Egypt nearly
22 years of stability and prosperity." "Uh, why don't we even know
what she looked like?" "Most of the art and descriptions
came long after her lifetime in the first century BCE, just like most of 
the things written about her." "So what do we actually know? Cleopatra VII was the last
of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian Greek family 
that governed Egypt after its conquest by Alexander the Great. She ruled jointly in Alexandria 
with her brother- to whom she was also married- until he had her exiled." "But what does all this 
have to do with Rome?" "Egypt had long been a Roman client state, and Cleopatra's father incurred 
large debts to the Republic. After being defeated by Julius Caesar
in Rome's civil war, the General Pompey sought refuge in Egypt but was executed 
by Cleopatra's brother instead." "Caesar must have liked that." "Actually, he found the murder unseemly
and demanded repayment of Egypt's debt. He could have annexed Egypt, but Cleopatra convinced him to restore
her to the throne instead." "We hear she was quite convincing." "And why not? Cleopatra 
was a fascinating woman. She commanded armies at 21, spoke several languages, and was educated in a city 
with the world's finest library and some of the greatest 
scholars of the time." "Hmm." "She kept Caesar lounging 
in Egypt for months when Rome needed him." "Caesar did more than lounge. He was fascinated by Egypt's culture
and knowledge, and he learned much during his time there. When he returned to Rome, 
he reformed the calendar, commissioned a census, made plans for a public library, and proposed many 
new infrastructure projects." "Yes, all very ambitious, 
exactly what got him assassinated." "Don't blame the Queen for Rome's
strange politics. Her job was ruling Egypt,
and she did it well. She stabilized the economy, managed the vast bureaucracy, and curbed corruption by priests
and officials. When drought hit, she opened
the granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's
stability and independence with no revolts during 
the rest of her reign." "So what went wrong?" "After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen
couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters." "Actually, it was the Roman factions who
came demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice
but to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar,
if only for the sake of their son." "And again, she provided her particular
kind of support to Marc Antony." "Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's 
countless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated
the relationships? And why are only powerful women
defined by their sexuality?" "Order." "Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic
with their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced
of their megalomania." "And yet Octavian was the one 
who attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman
in power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself." "How ironic." Cleopatra's story survived mainly
in the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps 
with rumors and stereotypes. We may never know the full truth
of her life and her reign, but we can separate fact from rumor
by putting history on trial.
