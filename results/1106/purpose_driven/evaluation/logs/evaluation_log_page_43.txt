**Transcript**:
Where did Russia come from, why is it so big, and what are the differences 
between it and its neighbors? The answers lie in an epic story
of seafaring warriors, nomadic invaders, and the rise and fall of a medieval state
known as Kievan Rus. In the first millennium, a large group of tribes spread through
the dense woodlands of Eastern Europe. Because they had no writing system, much of what we know about them
comes from three main sources: archaeological evidence, accounts from literate scholars 
of the Roman Empire and the Middle East, and, lastly, an epic history called 
the Primary Chronicle compiled in the 12th century 
by a monk named Nestor. What they tell us is that these tribes
who shared a common Slavic language and polytheistic religion had by the 7th century split into
western, southern and eastern branches, the latter stretching from 
the Dniester River to the Volga and the Baltic Sea. As Nestor's story goes, after years of
subjugation by Vikings from the north, who, by the way, did not wear 
horned helmets in battle, the region's tribes revolted
and drove back the Northmen, but left to their own devices, 
they turned on each other. Such chaos ensued that, ironically, the tribes reached out to the foreigners
they had just expelled, inviting them to return 
and establish order. The Vikings accepted, sending a prince
named Rurik and his two brothers to rule. With Rurik's son, Oleg, 
expanding his realm into the south, and moving the capitol to Kiev, a former outpost of the Khazar Empire, the Kievan Rus was born, "Rus" most likely deriving from 
an old Norse word for "the men who row." The new princedom had complex relations
with its neighbors, alternating between alliance and warfare
with the Khazar and Byzantine Empires, as well as neighboring tribes. Religion played an important 
role in politics, and as the legend goes, in 987, the Rus prince Vladamir I decided
it was time to abandon Slavic paganism, and sent emissaries 
to explore neighboring faiths. Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol and Judaism's expulsion 
from its holy land, the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity after hearing odd accounts 
of its ceremonies. With Vladimir's conversion and marriage
to the Byzantine emperor's sister, as well as continued trade 
along the Volga route, the relationship between 
the two civilizations deepened. Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet
for Slavic languages based on a modified Greek script while Rus Viking warriors served as the
Byzantine Emperor's elite guard. For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished
from its rich resources and trade. Its noblemen and noblewomen married
prominent European rulers, while residents of some cities 
enjoyed great culture, literacy, and even democratic freedoms 
uncommon for the time. But nothing lasts forever. Fratricidal disputes over succession
began to erode central power as increasingly independent cities
ruled by rival princes vied for control. The Fourth Crusade 
and decline of Constantinople devastated the trade integral 
to Rus wealth and power, while Teutonic crusaders 
threatened northern territories. The final blow, however, would 
come from the east. Consumed by their squabbles, Rus princes paid little attention 
to the rumors of a mysterious unstoppable hoard until 1237, when 35,000 mounted 
archers led by Batu Khan swept through the Rus cities, sacking Kiev before continuing 
on to Hungary and Poland. The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,
its people now divided. In the east, which remained 
under Mongol rule, a remote trading post, known as Moscow, would grow to challenge 
the power of the Khans, conquering parts 
of their fragmenting empire, and, in many ways, succeeding it. As it absorbed other 
eastern Rus territories, it reclaimed the old name 
in its Greek form, Ruscia. Meanwhile, the western regions
whose leaders had avoided destruction through political maneuvering 
until the hoard withdrew came under the influence of Poland
and Lithuania. For the next few centuries, the former lands of Kievan Rus populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols would develop differences in society,
culture and language that remain to the present day.

**Transcript**:
Where did Russia come from, why is it so big, and what are the differences 
between it and its neighbors? The answers lie in an epic story
of seafaring warriors, nomadic invaders, and the rise and fall of a medieval state
known as Kievan Rus. In the first millennium, a large group of tribes spread through
the dense woodlands of Eastern Europe. Because they had no writing system, much of what we know about them
comes from three main sources: archaeological evidence, accounts from literate scholars 
of the Roman Empire and the Middle East, and, lastly, an epic history called 
the Primary Chronicle compiled in the 12th century 
by a monk named Nestor. What they tell us is that these tribes
who shared a common Slavic language and polytheistic religion had by the 7th century split into
western, southern and eastern branches, the latter stretching from 
the Dniester River to the Volga and the Baltic Sea. As Nestor's story goes, after years of
subjugation by Vikings from the north, who, by the way, did not wear 
horned helmets in battle, the region's tribes revolted
and drove back the Northmen, but left to their own devices, 
they turned on each other. Such chaos ensued that, ironically, the tribes reached out to the foreigners
they had just expelled, inviting them to return 
and establish order. The Vikings accepted, sending a prince
named Rurik and his two brothers to rule. With Rurik's son, Oleg, 
expanding his realm into the south, and moving the capitol to Kiev, a former outpost of the Khazar Empire, the Kievan Rus was born, "Rus" most likely deriving from 
an old Norse word for "the men who row." The new princedom had complex relations
with its neighbors, alternating between alliance and warfare
with the Khazar and Byzantine Empires, as well as neighboring tribes. Religion played an important 
role in politics, and as the legend goes, in 987, the Rus prince Vladamir I decided
it was time to abandon Slavic paganism, and sent emissaries 
to explore neighboring faiths. Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol and Judaism's expulsion 
from its holy land, the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity after hearing odd accounts 
of its ceremonies. With Vladimir's conversion and marriage
to the Byzantine emperor's sister, as well as continued trade 
along the Volga route, the relationship between 
the two civilizations deepened. Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet
for Slavic languages based on a modified Greek script while Rus Viking warriors served as the
Byzantine Emperor's elite guard. For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished
from its rich resources and trade. Its noblemen and noblewomen married
prominent European rulers, while residents of some cities 
enjoyed great culture, literacy, and even democratic freedoms 
uncommon for the time. But nothing lasts forever. Fratricidal disputes over succession
began to erode central power as increasingly independent cities
ruled by rival princes vied for control. The Fourth Crusade 
and decline of Constantinople devastated the trade integral 
to Rus wealth and power, while Teutonic crusaders 
threatened northern territories. The final blow, however, would 
come from the east. Consumed by their squabbles, Rus princes paid little attention 
to the rumors of a mysterious unstoppable hoard until 1237, when 35,000 mounted 
archers led by Batu Khan swept through the Rus cities, sacking Kiev before continuing 
on to Hungary and Poland. The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,
its people now divided. In the east, which remained 
under Mongol rule, a remote trading post, known as Moscow, would grow to challenge 
the power of the Khans, conquering parts 
of their fragmenting empire, and, in many ways, succeeding it. As it absorbed other 
eastern Rus territories, it reclaimed the old name 
in its Greek form, Ruscia. Meanwhile, the western regions
whose leaders had avoided destruction through political maneuvering 
until the hoard withdrew came under the influence of Poland
and Lithuania. For the next few centuries, the former lands of Kievan Rus populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols would develop differences in society,
culture and language that remain to the present day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about the major contributors to the decline of Kievan Rus, but rather about the final blow to the Kievan Rus.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the factors that contributed to the decline of Kievan Rus. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and the factors that contributed to the decline of Kievan Rus, I would suggest Question 6 or Question 7, as they both discuss the decline of the Kievan Rus. But again, they do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Packed inside every cell in your body
is a set of genetic instructions, 3.2 billion base pairs long. Deciphering these directions
would be a monumental task but could offer unprecedented insight
about the human body. In 1990, a consortium 
of 20 international research centers embarked on the world's largest
biological collaboration to accomplish this mission. The Human Genome Project proposed
to sequence the entire human genome over 15 years 
with $3 billion of public funds. Then, seven years 
before its scheduled completion, a private company called Celera announced
that they could accomplish the same goal in just three years
and at a fraction of the cost. The two camps discussed a joint venture,
but talks quickly fell apart as disagreements arose over legal
and ethical issues of genetic property. And so the race began. Though both teams used the same technology
to sequence the entire human genome, it was their strategies 
that made all the difference. Their paths diverged 
in the most critical of steps: the first one. In the Human Genome Project's approach, the genome was first divided into smaller,
more manageable chunks about 150,000 base pairs long that overlapped each other
a little bit on both ends. Each of these fragments of DNA was inserted inside a bacterial 
artificial chromosome where they were cloned and fingerprinted. The fingerprints showed scientists
where the fragments overlapped without knowing the actual sequence. Using the overlapping bits as a guide, the researchers marked 
each fragment's place in the genome to create a contiguous map, a process that took about six years. The cloned fragments were sequenced
in labs around the world following one of the project's
two major principles: that collaboration on our shared heritage
was open to all nations. In each case, the fragments 
were arbitrarily broken up into small, overlapping pieces
about 1,000 base pairs long. Then, using a technology 
called the Sanger method, each piece was sequenced letter by letter. This rigorous map-based approach
called hierarchical shotgun sequencing minimized the risk of misassembly, a huge hazard of sequencing genomes
with many repetitive portions, like the human genome. The consortium's 
"better safe than sorry" approach contrasted starkly with Celera's strategy
called whole genome shotgun sequencing. It hinged on skipping 
the mapping phase entirely, a faster, though foolhardy, approach
according to some. The entire genome was directly chopped up into a giant heap 
of small, overlapping bits. Once these bits were sequenced
via the Sanger method, Celera would take the formidable risk
of reconstructing the genome using just the overlaps. But perhaps their decision
wasn't such a gamble because guess whose freshly completed map
was available online for free? The Human Genome Consortium, in accordance with 
the project's second major principle which held that all of the project's data would be shared publicly
within 24 hours of collection. So in 1998, scientists around the world were furiously sequencing 
lines of genetic code using the tried and true, yet laborious,
Sanger method. Finally, after three exhausting years
of continuous sequencing and assembling, the verdict was in. In February 2001, both groups 
simultaneously published working drafts of more than 90%
of the human genome, several years ahead 
of the consortium's schedule. The race ended in a tie. The Human Genome Project's practice
of immediately sharing its data was an unusual one. It is more typical for scientists
to closely guard their data until they are able to analyze it
and publish their conclusions. Instead, the Human Genome Project
accelerated the pace of research and created an international
collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Since then, robust investment in both
the public and private sector has led to the identification
of many disease related genes and remarkable advances 
in sequencing technology. Today, a person's genome can be sequenced
in just a few days. However, reading the genome 
is only the first step. We're a long way away from understanding
what most of our genes do and how they are controlled. Those are some of the challenges for the next generation 
of ambitious research initiatives.

**Transcript**:
Packed inside every cell in your body
is a set of genetic instructions, 3.2 billion base pairs long. Deciphering these directions
would be a monumental task but could offer unprecedented insight
about the human body. In 1990, a consortium 
of 20 international research centers embarked on the world's largest
biological collaboration to accomplish this mission. The Human Genome Project proposed
to sequence the entire human genome over 15 years 
with $3 billion of public funds. Then, seven years 
before its scheduled completion, a private company called Celera announced
that they could accomplish the same goal in just three years
and at a fraction of the cost. The two camps discussed a joint venture,
but talks quickly fell apart as disagreements arose over legal
and ethical issues of genetic property. And so the race began. Though both teams used the same technology
to sequence the entire human genome, it was their strategies 
that made all the difference. Their paths diverged 
in the most critical of steps: the first one. In the Human Genome Project's approach, the genome was first divided into smaller,
more manageable chunks about 150,000 base pairs long that overlapped each other
a little bit on both ends. Each of these fragments of DNA was inserted inside a bacterial 
artificial chromosome where they were cloned and fingerprinted. The fingerprints showed scientists
where the fragments overlapped without knowing the actual sequence. Using the overlapping bits as a guide, the researchers marked 
each fragment's place in the genome to create a contiguous map, a process that took about six years. The cloned fragments were sequenced
in labs around the world following one of the project's
two major principles: that collaboration on our shared heritage
was open to all nations. In each case, the fragments 
were arbitrarily broken up into small, overlapping pieces
about 1,000 base pairs long. Then, using a technology 
called the Sanger method, each piece was sequenced letter by letter. This rigorous map-based approach
called hierarchical shotgun sequencing minimized the risk of misassembly, a huge hazard of sequencing genomes
with many repetitive portions, like the human genome. The consortium's 
"better safe than sorry" approach contrasted starkly with Celera's strategy
called whole genome shotgun sequencing. It hinged on skipping 
the mapping phase entirely, a faster, though foolhardy, approach
according to some. The entire genome was directly chopped up into a giant heap 
of small, overlapping bits. Once these bits were sequenced
via the Sanger method, Celera would take the formidable risk
of reconstructing the genome using just the overlaps. But perhaps their decision
wasn't such a gamble because guess whose freshly completed map
was available online for free? The Human Genome Consortium, in accordance with 
the project's second major principle which held that all of the project's data would be shared publicly
within 24 hours of collection. So in 1998, scientists around the world were furiously sequencing 
lines of genetic code using the tried and true, yet laborious,
Sanger method. Finally, after three exhausting years
of continuous sequencing and assembling, the verdict was in. In February 2001, both groups 
simultaneously published working drafts of more than 90%
of the human genome, several years ahead 
of the consortium's schedule. The race ended in a tie. The Human Genome Project's practice
of immediately sharing its data was an unusual one. It is more typical for scientists
to closely guard their data until they are able to analyze it
and publish their conclusions. Instead, the Human Genome Project
accelerated the pace of research and created an international
collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Since then, robust investment in both
the public and private sector has led to the identification
of many disease related genes and remarkable advances 
in sequencing technology. Today, a person's genome can be sequenced
in just a few days. However, reading the genome 
is only the first step. We're a long way away from understanding
what most of our genes do and how they are controlled. Those are some of the challenges for the next generation 
of ambitious research initiatives.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What was the benefit of the Human Genome Project's "better safe than sorry" approach? 

However, the options provided for this question do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 4: What was the main difference between the strategies used by the Human Genome Project and Celera? is a better match in terms of question intent and content.

But an even closer match is Question 6's option C, which states that the Human Genome Project's approach "minimized the risk of misassembly." This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks why Celera's approach was considered riskier.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content. However, its options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that Question 4 is still the closest match, but I also noticed that its options do not directly address the risk associated with Celera's approach.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the difference in risk between the two approaches. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

However, considering the available options, I would still recommend Question 4 as the closest match, as it addresses the difference in strategies between the Human Genome Project and Celera.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it takes to sequence a human genome using the latest technology. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 2 asks about the initial proposed duration of the Human Genome Project, which is related to the timeline of genome sequencing.

However, a closer match is not found among the generated MCQs, as none of them specifically ask about the current time it takes to sequence a human genome.

But if we look at the content of the transcript, we can infer that Question 9 is the closest match in terms of the context of the latest technology and advancements in genome sequencing.

So, the closest match would be Question 9, but it's not a direct match.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the improvement of national well-being, and Question 7 asks about the lessons from the examples of Poland, Morocco, and Brazil regarding improving well-being. 

The correct option for the ground truth MCQ is "Is not solely dependent on money," which is similar to the correct option for Question 7, which would be "Good leadership and clear goals are necessary for improving well-being" (option C), as it implies that money is not the only factor. However, a more direct match is option A in Question 7, which states "Improving well-being requires a lot of money" and is an incorrect option, implying that the correct answer is that it does not require a lot of money.

**Transcript**:
[Music] which countries have grown the fastest in recent years many people might name Singapore or Korea but Poland or Morocco might not readily come to mind this is because for many decades we have thought of national growth in terms of GDP which shows the total value of goods and services a country produces but what it doesn't show are some of the things that matter most to its people things like working Public Services clean air accessible education safety from violence and harassment and speaking freely without fear of arrest so how can these factors be measured this is where the sustainable Economic Development assessment comes in using 10 Dimensions it measures not only a country's economic performance but its social and environmental sustainability as well as the outcome of its long-term Investments rather than giving a simple ranking SATA shows where countries are doing well and where more work is needed and using it alongside GDP reveals how effectively a country converts economic growth into improvements in overall well-being so although GDP growth usually yields some quality of life improvements a few countries have achieved impressive results without a great deal of resources after announcing a focus on the safety and well-being of all citizens Poland made some of the greatest strides in sustainability and governance through policies like funding for renewable resources and establishing a Central anti-corruption Bureau Morocco's promotion of women's roles in politics and society as well as equal rights in marriage and property upon divorce led to Greater gender equality which correlates highly with overall progress and the central program in Brazil's successful drive to cut poverty in half cost only half a percent of their GDP the lesson from these very different countries is that improving well-being doesn't require a lot of money but it does require good leadership clear goals and policies specifically focused on making the country and the world a better place for its people

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the improvement of national well-being, and Question 7 asks about the lessons from the examples of Poland, Morocco, and Brazil regarding improving well-being. 

The correct option for the ground truth MCQ is "Is not solely dependent on money," which is similar to the correct option for Question 7, which would be "Good leadership and clear goals are necessary for improving well-being" (option C), as it implies that money is not the only factor. However, a more direct match is option A in Question 7, which states "Improving well-being requires a lot of money" and is an incorrect option, implying that the correct answer is that it does not require a lot of money.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems
to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: "Be more confident." And most likely, this is what you think
when you hear it: "If only it were that simple." But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,
worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes
when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously 
to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors 
that impact confidence. One: what you're born with,
such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance
of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures
of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about 
and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle
these three factors, but the personal choices we make
certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind 
a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate
our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you
an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success 
when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music
with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose
or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,
like a muscle? These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents
are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered 
something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset
and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity
to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get
stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset
are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better 
in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by
twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter." The Wright Brothers built on history's
failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly
and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond 
to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try 
different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge 
you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, 
stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that
whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge
and understanding. This is confidence.

or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,
like a muscle? These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents
are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered 
something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset
and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity
to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get
stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset
are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better 
in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by
twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter." The Wright Brothers built on history's
failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly
and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond 
to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try 
different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge 
you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, 
stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that
whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge
and understanding. This is confidence.

Translator: Jennifer Cody
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems
to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: "Be more confident." And most likely, this is what you think
when you hear it: "If only it were that simple." But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,
worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes
when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously 
to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors 
that impact confidence. One: what you're born with,
such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance
of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures
of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about 
and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle
these three factors, but the personal choices we make
certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind 
a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate
our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you
an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success 
when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music
with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose
or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,
like a muscle? These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents

**Question 7: What is an example of a quick fix to boost confidence in the short term? Options: A. Listening to music with deep bass, B. Reading a book on self-improvement, C. Engaging in a long-term exercise routine, D. Practicing a new skill for hours**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only provides one example of a quick fix, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks for multiple ways to feel more confident.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that includes multiple quick fixes, such as giving oneself a pep talk, striking a power pose, and imagining oneself succeeding. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would suggest:

However, I would like to note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that includes multiple quick fixes.

To better match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that includes multiple quick fixes, such as:

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Although Question 2 does not ask about the description of the grass, one of its options (C) mentions the grass, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, this is still a weak connection.

A more appropriate approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the description of the grass in the poem. 

If I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but with a very low confidence score.

**Transcript**:
Compared to the whitewater streams that tumble
down mountainsides, the meandering rivers of the plains may seem tame and lazy. But
mountain streams are corralled by the steep-walled valleys they carve – their courses are literally
set in stone. Out on the open plains, those stony walls give way to soft soil, allowing
rivers much more freedom to shift their banks and set their own ever-changing courses to
the sea: courses that almost never run straight. At least not for long, because all it takes
to turn a straight stretch of river into a bendy one is a little disturbance and a lot
of time  – and in nature, there’s plenty of both.
      Say, for example, that a muskrat  burrows
herself a den in one bank of a stream. Her tunnels make for a cozy home,  but they also
weaken the bank, which eventually begins to crumble and slump into the stream. Water rushes into the newly-formed hollow,
sweeping away loose dirt and making the hollow even hollower, which lets the water rush a
little faster and sweep away a little more dirt from the bank...and so on, and so on
. As more of the stream’s flow is diverted
into the deepening hole on one bank and away from the other side of the channel, the flow
there weakens and slows. And since slow-moving water can’t carry the sand-sized particles
that fast-moving water can, that dirt drops to the bottom and builds up to make the water
there shallower and slower, and then keeps accumulating until the edge of the stream
becomes new land on the inside bank.        
Meanwhile, the fast-moving water near the outside bank sweeps out of the curve with
enough momentum to carry it across the channel and slam it into the other side, where it
starts to carve another curve . And then another, and then another, and then another. The wider
the stream, the longer it takes the slingshotting current to reach the other side, and the greater
the downstream distance to the next curve. In fact, measurements of meandering streams
all over the world reveal a strikingly regular pattern : the length of one S-shaped meander
tends to be about six times the width of the channel . So little tiny meandering streams
tend to look just like miniature versions of their bigger relatives.
     As long as nothing gets in the way of a river’s
meandering , its curves will continue to grow curvier and curvier until they loop around
and bumble into themselves. When that happens, the river follows the straighter path downhill,
leaving behind a crescent-shaped remnant called an oxbow lake. Or a billabong. Or a lago en
herradura. Or a bras mort ...     
We have lots of names for these lakes, since they can occur pretty much anywhere liquid
flows – which brings up an interesting question:

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided set. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, Question 2 is the closest match.

Question 2 describes the effect of a muskrat burrowing into the bank of a stream, which can be considered a "little disturbance" that can lead to changes in the river's course. Although it does not directly ask what is needed to turn a straight flowing river into a "bendy" one, it touches on the idea that a small disturbance can have a significant impact on the river's course.

However, if I had to choose an answer that best aligns with the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest match in terms of the overall intent of the question, as it discusses the changes in a river's course over time.

But since Question 2 is the closest match in terms of a "little disturbance" and Question 7 is the closest match in terms of the overall intent of the question, I will choose a question that is not present in the list but if I had to choose I will choose Question 2.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, the options provided for Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a combination of Question 4 and Question 5, as they both describe the effects on the inside bank of the stream.

Question 4 describes the flow of water becoming slower, and Question 5 describes the water becoming shallower. Both of these effects are mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ (D. all of the above).

If I had to choose one question index, I would choose Question 5, but I would recommend combining the content of Question 4 and Question 5 to create a more accurate match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. However, the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a combination of Question 4 and Question 5, as they both describe the processes occurring on the inside and outside banks of a meandering stream.

However, if I had to choose one question that best matches the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 5, as it describes the result of the slow-moving water on the inside bank of the stream, which is related to the formation of new land.

But since none of the questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will also consider Question 4, which talks about the flow of water on the inside bank as the channel deepens on the outside bank.

Considering the options provided, I would say the most similar question is Question 5 and Question 4.

**Transcript**:
Compared to the whitewater streams that tumble
down mountainsides, the meandering rivers of the plains may seem tame and lazy. But
mountain streams are corralled by the steep-walled valleys they carve – their courses are literally
set in stone. Out on the open plains, those stony walls give way to soft soil, allowing
rivers much more freedom to shift their banks and set their own ever-changing courses to
the sea: courses that almost never run straight. At least not for long, because all it takes
to turn a straight stretch of river into a bendy one is a little disturbance and a lot
of time  – and in nature, there’s plenty of both.
      Say, for example, that a muskrat  burrows
herself a den in one bank of a stream. Her tunnels make for a cozy home,  but they also
weaken the bank, which eventually begins to crumble and slump into the stream. Water rushes into the newly-formed hollow,
sweeping away loose dirt and making the hollow even hollower, which lets the water rush a
little faster and sweep away a little more dirt from the bank...and so on, and so on
. As more of the stream’s flow is diverted
into the deepening hole on one bank and away from the other side of the channel, the flow
there weakens and slows. And since slow-moving water can’t carry the sand-sized particles
that fast-moving water can, that dirt drops to the bottom and builds up to make the water
there shallower and slower, and then keeps accumulating until the edge of the stream
becomes new land on the inside bank.        
Meanwhile, the fast-moving water near the outside bank sweeps out of the curve with
enough momentum to carry it across the channel and slam it into the other side, where it
starts to carve another curve . And then another, and then another, and then another. The wider
the stream, the longer it takes the slingshotting current to reach the other side, and the greater
the downstream distance to the next curve. In fact, measurements of meandering streams
all over the world reveal a strikingly regular pattern : the length of one S-shaped meander
tends to be about six times the width of the channel . So little tiny meandering streams
tend to look just like miniature versions of their bigger relatives.
     As long as nothing gets in the way of a river’s
meandering , its curves will continue to grow curvier and curvier until they loop around
and bumble into themselves. When that happens, the river follows the straighter path downhill,
leaving behind a crescent-shaped remnant called an oxbow lake. Or a billabong. Or a lago en
herradura. Or a bras mort ...     
We have lots of names for these lakes, since they can occur pretty much anywhere liquid
flows – which brings up an interesting question:

collaborative feats with your own eyes: The International Space Station. Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,
and weighing more than 320 cars, the International Space Station 
is so large that no single rocket could have 
lifted it into orbit. Instead, it was assembled piece by piece while hurtling through space
at 28,000 kilometers per hour, lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes. It all started when sixteen nations signed the Space Station 
Intergovernmental Agreement, laying out each partner's 
expected contributions to the ISS, from modules and maintenance
to sharing information and finances. At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars, the Space Station would be
the most expensive object ever built. The whole world watched as a Russian rocket launched 
the first module of the ISS into the sky. Zarya, meaning sunrise, 
was equipped with two solar panels and a propulsion system 
that had the important task of keeping the young station 
from crashing into the Earth by staying a safe 400 kilometers away. The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour
followed two weeks later carrying Unity, a node module to which
other modules could be connected, and an international 
six-person assembly crew. Then came Zvezda, which brought
communications and living accommodations. Ever since the International 
Space Station's first tenants arrived, it's been continually occupied with more than 200 visitors spending 
an average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti 
holds the record for the longest single space flight
by a woman at 199 days on the ISS. 2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,
the first of four research modules, where astronauts spend
approximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments
in microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off 
muscle atrophy, station maintenance and repair, and connecting with family 
or awe-inspired minds around the world. But they still find time for fun,
with regular movie nights and even shooting 
the first music video in space. Destiny also controls the seven-jointed
robotic Canadarm2. Capable of moving 
more than 100,000 kilograms, it's perfect for unloading 
new arrivals from shuttles. 2001 was a busy year for the Space Station
with the addition of Quest, the main airlock for strolls outside, and Pirs, a pier for Russian 
spacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready 
emergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering 
research modules to the ISS, the space shuttle
Columbia exploded during reentry tragically killing 
the seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly
picked up pace with the addition of more hubs, 
airlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning
360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included 
platforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated
by the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough
to power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International 
Space Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space 
Shuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve
as an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people 
began a one-year stay on the ISS, allowing scientists to study the long-term
physical and psychological effects of being in space, which would prove useful for increasingly
ambitious space travel, like trips to Mars. Over its lifetime, we've learned 
an immense amount scientifically, but also about 
our capacity to work together and accomplish truly remarkable acts.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and options, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that mentions the names of the Russian modules or spacecraft.

The closest match would be Question 4, which mentions the Zarya module. However, it does not specifically ask about the escape spacecraft.

A more relevant match would be Question 7, which mentions the Quest module and its purpose. However, it does not specifically ask about the Russian escape spacecraft.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will select the one that is most relevant to the topic.

The closest match is not among the provided options, but if I had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, as it mentions a Russian module.

However, I must note that the correct answer is actually Question 2 of the original transcript: "Then came Pirs, a pier for Russian spacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready emergency escape vehicle, Soyuz."

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None

an average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti 
holds the record for the longest single space flight
by a woman at 199 days on the ISS. 2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,
the first of four research modules, where astronauts spend
approximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments
in microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off 
muscle atrophy, station maintenance and repair, and connecting with family 
or awe-inspired minds around the world. But they still find time for fun,
with regular movie nights and even shooting 
the first music video in space. Destiny also controls the seven-jointed
robotic Canadarm2. Capable of moving 
more than 100,000 kilograms, it's perfect for unloading 
new arrivals from shuttles. 2001 was a busy year for the Space Station
with the addition of Quest, the main airlock for strolls outside, and Pirs, a pier for Russian 
spacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready 
emergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering 
research modules to the ISS, the space shuttle
Columbia exploded during reentry tragically killing 
the seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly
picked up pace with the addition of more hubs, 
airlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning
360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included 
platforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated
by the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough
to power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International 
Space Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space 
Shuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve
as an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people 
began a one-year stay on the ISS, allowing scientists to study the long-term
physical and psychological effects of being in space, which would prove useful for increasingly
ambitious space travel, like trips to Mars. Over its lifetime, we've learned 
an immense amount scientifically, but also about 
our capacity to work together and accomplish truly remarkable acts.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
An estimated 20 million cases of blindness
worldwide are caused by cataracts, a curable condition affecting the lens
that focuses images onto the eye's retina. A cataract occurs when proteins 
in the lens lose their normal arrangement, clumping together in a way that causes
discoloration or clouding, and eventually blocks most vision. Cataracts can be caused by eye injury, certain medications, ultraviolet radiation, diabetes, smoking, or some genetic disorders. But the most common cause is aging. In the United States, more than 50%
of people over the age of 80 develop them. Cataracts were treated 
over 2,500 years ago in India, though similar procedures 
may have existed even earlier in Ancient Egypt and Babylon. The most common procedure,
called couching, involved pressing 
a sharp instrument into the eye to loosen and push 
the clouded lens out of the way. Although this could increase 
the amount of light entering the eye, the lack of a lens would leave 
the patient's vision out of focus. Despite its low success rate,
and high risk of infection or injury, couching is still performed 
in some parts of the world. Later procedures would also focus
on removing the cloudy lens, for example, by making an opening
in the cornea to pull out the lens along with the membrane capsule 
surrounding it. While the invention of eyeglasses
allowed for some restoration of focus, they had to be extremely thick to help. Furthermore, such techniques
still caused complications, like damaging the retina, or leaving the eye 
with uncomfortable stitches. But in the 20th century, 
something unexpected happened. Eye surgeon Sir Harold Ridley was treating
World War II casualties when he noticed that acrylic plastic from
a shattered aircraft cockpit had become lodged in a pilot's eyes
without triggering an adverse reaction. This led him to propose surgically
implanting artificial lenses into the eye to replace cataracts. And despite initial resistance, the method became standard practice
by the 1980s. Since Ridley's discovery, the intraocular lens 
has undergone several improvements. Modern lenses can fit 
into the membrane capsule that the cataract is extracted from, leaving more of 
the eye's natural anatomy intact. And the ability to fine-tune 
the lens curvature allows the surgery to restore 
a patient's normal vision without the need for glasses. Of course, surgical techniques 
have also progressed. Microscopic procedures use 
small instruments or lasers to make precise incisions of one 
or two millimeters in the cornea, while an ultrasound probe breaks up
and removes the cataracted lens with minimal trauma to the eye. Low-tech versions of this operation have
made the surgery quick and inexpensive, helping it spread 
across the developing world. Places like Aravind Eye Hospital in India have pioneered high-volume, 
low-cost cataract surgery for as little as six dollars. Why then, with all these advances, are there still so many 
blind people in the world? The main issue is access to health care, with poor infrastructure 
and a shortage of doctors being a major barrier in many regions. But this is not the only problem. In many rural areas with poor education, blindness is often accepted 
as an inevitable part of aging, for which someone 
might not think to seek treatment. This is why information is crucial. Increased community awareness programs
and the spread of mobile phones mean that many of those who might have remained blind for
the rest of their lives due to cataracts are now reachable. And for them, 
a brighter future is in sight.

**Transcript**:
An estimated 20 million cases of blindness
worldwide are caused by cataracts, a curable condition affecting the lens
that focuses images onto the eye's retina. A cataract occurs when proteins 
in the lens lose their normal arrangement, clumping together in a way that causes
discoloration or clouding, and eventually blocks most vision. Cataracts can be caused by eye injury, certain medications, ultraviolet radiation, diabetes, smoking, or some genetic disorders. But the most common cause is aging. In the United States, more than 50%
of people over the age of 80 develop them. Cataracts were treated 
over 2,500 years ago in India, though similar procedures 
may have existed even earlier in Ancient Egypt and Babylon. The most common procedure,
called couching, involved pressing 
a sharp instrument into the eye to loosen and push 
the clouded lens out of the way. Although this could increase 
the amount of light entering the eye, the lack of a lens would leave 
the patient's vision out of focus. Despite its low success rate,
and high risk of infection or injury, couching is still performed 
in some parts of the world. Later procedures would also focus
on removing the cloudy lens, for example, by making an opening
in the cornea to pull out the lens along with the membrane capsule 
surrounding it. While the invention of eyeglasses
allowed for some restoration of focus, they had to be extremely thick to help. Furthermore, such techniques
still caused complications, like damaging the retina, or leaving the eye 
with uncomfortable stitches. But in the 20th century, 
something unexpected happened. Eye surgeon Sir Harold Ridley was treating
World War II casualties when he noticed that acrylic plastic from
a shattered aircraft cockpit had become lodged in a pilot's eyes
without triggering an adverse reaction. This led him to propose surgically
implanting artificial lenses into the eye to replace cataracts. And despite initial resistance, the method became standard practice
by the 1980s. Since Ridley's discovery, the intraocular lens 
has undergone several improvements. Modern lenses can fit 
into the membrane capsule that the cataract is extracted from, leaving more of 
the eye's natural anatomy intact. And the ability to fine-tune 
the lens curvature allows the surgery to restore 
a patient's normal vision without the need for glasses. Of course, surgical techniques 
have also progressed. Microscopic procedures use 
small instruments or lasers to make precise incisions of one 
or two millimeters in the cornea, while an ultrasound probe breaks up
and removes the cataracted lens with minimal trauma to the eye. Low-tech versions of this operation have
made the surgery quick and inexpensive, helping it spread 
across the developing world. Places like Aravind Eye Hospital in India have pioneered high-volume, 
low-cost cataract surgery for as little as six dollars. Why then, with all these advances, are there still so many 
blind people in the world? The main issue is access to health care, with poor infrastructure 
and a shortage of doctors being a major barrier in many regions. But this is not the only problem. In many rural areas with poor education, blindness is often accepted 
as an inevitable part of aging, for which someone 
might not think to seek treatment. This is why information is crucial. Increased community awareness programs
and the spread of mobile phones mean that many of those who might have remained blind for
the rest of their lives due to cataracts are now reachable. And for them, 
a brighter future is in sight.

**Transcript**:
Think back to a really vivid memory. Got it? Okay, now try to remember what 
you had for lunch three weeks ago. That second memory 
probably isn't as strong, but why not? Why do we remember some things,
and not others? And why do memories eventually fade? Let's look at how memories form
in the first place. When you experience something,
like dialing a phone number, the experience is converted 
into a pulse of electrical energy that zips along a network of neurons. Information first lands 
in short term memory, where it's available 
from anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's then transferred to long-term memory
through areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage regions
across the brain. Neurons throughout the brain
communicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. If two neurons communicate repeatedly,
a remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication 
between them increases. This process, 
called long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism
by which memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost? Age is one factor. As we get older, 
synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily 
we can retrieve memories. Scientists have several theories about
what's behind this deterioration, from actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus 
loses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total loss of 20% by the time 
you're 80 years old to the drop in the production 
of neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine,
which is vital to learning and memory. These changes seem to affect how people
retrieve stored information. Age also affects 
our memory-making abilities. Memories are encoded most strongly
when we're paying attention, when we're deeply engaged,
and when information is meaningful to us. Mental and physical health problems,
which tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability 
to pay attention, and thus act as memory thieves. Another leading cause of memory problems
is chronic stress. When we're constantly overloaded with work
and personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert. This response has evolved from
the physiological mechanism designed to make sure 
we can survive in a crisis. Stress chemicals help mobilize energy
and increase alertness. However, with chronic stress our bodies
become flooded with these chemicals, resulting in a loss of brain cells
and an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability 
to retain new information. Depression is another culprit. People who are depressed are 40%
more likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals 
less attentive to new information. Dwelling on sad events in the past,
another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay 
attention to the present, affecting the ability to store
short-term memories. Isolation, which is tied to depression,
is another memory thief. A study by the Harvard School 
of Public Health found that older people 
with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline
over a six-year period. The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction 
gives our brain a mental workout. Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain
or risk losing it. But don't despair. There are several steps you can take to aid your brain 
in preserving your memories. Make sure you keep physically active. Increased blood flow 
to the brain is helpful. And eat well. Your brain needs all the right nutrients
to keep functioning correctly. And finally, give your brain a workout. Exposing your brain to challenges,
like learning a new language, is one of the best defenses for keeping
your memories intact.

Although Question 3 does not have the exact same options as the ground truth MCQ, its content and intent are similar. Question 3 asks about a factor that contributes to the deterioration of memory retrieval as we age, and one of the options mentions "actual brain shrinkage and loss of neurons in the hippocampus." This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about two factors that contribute to memory loss as we age and mentions "brain shrinkage and a drop in neurotransmitter production" as the correct option.

However, a more similar question would be one that asks about two factors, similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

**Transcript**:
Think back to a really vivid memory. Got it? Okay, now try to remember what 
you had for lunch three weeks ago. That second memory 
probably isn't as strong, but why not? Why do we remember some things,
and not others? And why do memories eventually fade? Let's look at how memories form
in the first place. When you experience something,
like dialing a phone number, the experience is converted 
into a pulse of electrical energy that zips along a network of neurons. Information first lands 
in short term memory, where it's available 
from anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's then transferred to long-term memory
through areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage regions
across the brain. Neurons throughout the brain
communicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. If two neurons communicate repeatedly,
a remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication 
between them increases. This process, 
called long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism
by which memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost? Age is one factor. As we get older, 
synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily 
we can retrieve memories. Scientists have several theories about
what's behind this deterioration, from actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus 
loses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total loss of 20% by the time 
you're 80 years old to the drop in the production 
of neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine,
which is vital to learning and memory. These changes seem to affect how people
retrieve stored information. Age also affects 
our memory-making abilities. Memories are encoded most strongly
when we're paying attention, when we're deeply engaged,
and when information is meaningful to us. Mental and physical health problems,
which tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability 
to pay attention, and thus act as memory thieves. Another leading cause of memory problems
is chronic stress. When we're constantly overloaded with work
and personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert. This response has evolved from
the physiological mechanism designed to make sure 
we can survive in a crisis. Stress chemicals help mobilize energy
and increase alertness. However, with chronic stress our bodies
become flooded with these chemicals, resulting in a loss of brain cells
and an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability 
to retain new information. Depression is another culprit. People who are depressed are 40%
more likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals 
less attentive to new information. Dwelling on sad events in the past,
another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay 
attention to the present, affecting the ability to store
short-term memories. Isolation, which is tied to depression,
is another memory thief. A study by the Harvard School 
of Public Health found that older people 
with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline
over a six-year period. The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction 
gives our brain a mental workout. Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain
or risk losing it. But don't despair. There are several steps you can take to aid your brain 
in preserving your memories. Make sure you keep physically active. Increased blood flow 
to the brain is helpful. And eat well. Your brain needs all the right nutrients
to keep functioning correctly. And finally, give your brain a workout. Exposing your brain to challenges,
like learning a new language, is one of the best defenses for keeping
your memories intact.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the options in Question 1 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are very similar. Both questions ask about the type of person who believes that intelligence can be developed, and both questions have an option that correctly states this belief (Option C in Question 1 and Option A in the ground truth MCQ).

However, to make Question 1 more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the options in Question 1 could be revised to match the options in the ground truth MCQ. For example, Question 1 could be revised as follows:

Question 1: What type of person believes that intelligence can be developed?
Options: A. A person with a growth mindset, B. A person with a fixed mindset

This revised version of Question 1 would be an even closer match to the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the options and wording are not identical, the intent and content of Question 1 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions focus on the concept of intelligence and how it is perceived by individuals with a growth mindset. The ground truth MCQ asks which type of student would say that intelligence is like a muscle, while Question 1 asks what people with a growth mindset believe about intelligence. 

However, if I had to choose a question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options, I would say that none of the questions perfectly match. But if I had to choose, I would say Question 2 is the closest match because it presents a clear contrast between the two mindsets and mentions the analogy of "like a muscle" in one of the options, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But since the options for Question 2 do not include "A student with a growth mindset" and "A student with a fixed mindset" like the ground truth MCQ, I would still say that Question 1 is the closest match in terms of question intent.

However, I must note that the best match is still not perfect, as the options provided for the generated MCQs do not align with the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, a more similar question is not available among the options.

However, if we carefully examine the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 2 and the ground truth MCQ both deal with the concept of fixed and growth mindsets, but they do not ask the same question.

A more similar question can be created by combining the content of Question 2 and the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if we must choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar.

But there is another option, let's take a look at Question 10: What is the main difference between students with a fixed mindset and students with a growth mindset? Options: A. Their level of intelligence, B. Their motivation to learn, C. Their view of intelligence as fixed or developable, D. Their learning style Correct Option: None

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not have an exact match with the ground truth MCQ in terms of wording, it shares a similar intent. Question 1 asks about the belief of people with a growth mindset regarding intelligence, which aligns with the statement in the ground truth MCQ. However, the options provided in Question 1 do not directly match the quote in the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match could be created by rephrasing Question 2, which describes how people with a fixed mindset view intelligence and provides an option that describes the view of people with a growth mindset (Option A: "Like a muscle that can be developed"). If rephrased to focus on the growth mindset, this question would be a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

Given the available options, Question 1 remains the closest match, but it is essential to note that a more accurate match could be created by modifying Question 2 to focus on the growth mindset.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, a more similar question is not available among the options.

However, if we carefully examine the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 2 and the ground truth MCQ both deal with the concept of fixed and growth mindsets, but they do not ask the same question.

A more similar question can be created by combining the content of Question 2 and the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if we must choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar.

But there is another option, let's take a look at Question 10: What is the main difference between students with a fixed mindset and students with a growth mindset? Options: A. Their level of intelligence, B. Their motivation to learn, C. Their view of intelligence as fixed or developable, D. Their learning style Correct Option: None

**Transcript**:
Vatican City: capitol of the Catholic Church,
home to the pope, owner of impressive collections of art and history all contained within the
borders of the world's smallest country: conveniently circumnavigateable on foot in only 40 minutes. Just how did the world end up with this tiny
nation? The short answer is: because Mussolini and
the long answer is fiendishly complicated so here's a simplified medium version: The popes used to rule a country called the
Papal States that covered much of modern day Italy. It was during this 1,000+ year reign that
the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica the largest church in the world -- and also
built a wall around the base of a hill known as Vatican upon which St. Peter's Stood. But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought
Rome would be an awesome capital for their country and so conquered the Papal States. His nation destroyed the Pope hid behind the
walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed,
while simultaneously complaining about being a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy -- which
according to him didn't exist. Rather than risk religious civil war by getting
rid of the pope the Kingdom of Italy decided to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give
up -- but religion is nothing if not obstinate -- and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 popes and sixty years
later nothing had changed. Which brings us to Benito Mussolini the then
prime minister of Italy who was tired of listing to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics
about his self-imposed imprisonment so Mussolini thought he could score some political points
by striking a deal which looked like this: 1) Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope. and… 2) Italy gave the Pope a bunch of apology
money In return 1) The Pope acknowledged that Italy existed
and and… 2) The Pope promised to remain neutral in
politics and wars. On the off chance that, you know, Mussolini
thought this might be a thing. The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican
City was born. And today the tiny nation on a hill has all
the things you'd expect of a country: its own government that makes its own laws that
are enforced by its own police, who put people who break them in its own jail. It also has its own bank and prints its own
stamps and issues its own license plates, though only its citizens can drive within
its borders presumably because of terrible, terrible parking -- and as the true mark of
any self-respecting nation: it has its own top-level domain: .VA But, despite all these national trappings
Vatican City is not really like any other country. Hold on to your fancy hat, because it's about
to get weird: To understand the Vatican: there are two people
and two things that you need to know about: the famous pope, the incredibly confusing
Holy See, The Country of Vatican City and along with that the almost completely unknown
King of Vatican City. But first the Pope: who gets a throne to sit
upon and from which he acts as the Bishop for all the Catholics in Rome. Actually all Bishops in the Catholic Church
get their own thrones but because the Bishop of Rome is also the Pope his thrown is special
and has it's own special name: The Holy See. Every time a Pope dies or retires there is
a sort of game of thrones to see which of the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy
See. So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal. As such the name The Holy See not only refers
to the throne but also all the rules that make the Catholic Church the Catholic Church. When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned
deal, technically he gave the land of Vatican City to The Holy See -- which, believe it
or not, is a legal corporate person in international law. Basically every time you hear the words The
Holy See think Catholic Church, Inc of which the Pope is the CEO. Now back to the King. The King of Vatican City has absolute, unchecked
power within the country's borders and his presence makes Vatican City one of only six
remanning absolute monarchies in the world, including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
and Swaziland. The King's absolute power is why Vatican City
can't join the European Union because only democracies are allowed. Through Vatican City does, strictly speaking,
have a legislative brach of government -- staffed by cardinals, appointed by the pope -- the
King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions and at any time for any reason. So why do you never hear about the King of
Vatican City? Because though King and Pope are two different
roles, they just happen to be occupied by the same person at the same time -- which
has the funny consequence that, because the Pope is elected and the King is all-powerful
but they're the same guy it makes Vatican City the world's only elected, non-hereditary
absolute monarchy. It's this dual-role that makes untangling
Vatican City so difficult because the Pope, depending on the situation either acts as
The King of the country of Vatican City or the Pope of the Holy See. Got it? No? OK, here's an analogy: Imagine if a powerful international company,
say Grey Industries, had a CEO who convinced the United States to give one of its islands
to the Company which then made the island into a new country -- Greytropolis -- with
an absolute monarchy as its government and the law that the King of Greytropolis is,
by definition, the CEO of Grey Industries. It's pretty obvious at that point that the
CEO should move his corporate headquarters to the new nation -- so that the laws of the
country can benefit the company and the company's global reach can benefit the country. As for the man in the middle sometimes it's
good to the the CEO and sometimes it's good to be the king. That is essentially Vatican City. But if you're still confused, don't worry
even other countries can't keep it straight. For example the United Nations has The Holy
See the corporation as a member but not Vatican City the actual country. And The Holy See gives passports to Vatican
City citizens that other countries accept even though those passports come from a company,
not a country. And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they
are perhaps the strangest consequence of the Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch. While other countries mint new citizens with
the ever popular process of human reproduction Vatican City does not. No one in Vatican City is born a citizen -- and
that's not just because, within a rounding error, there are no female Vaticans. The only way to become a citizen is for the
King of Vatican City to appoint you as one. And the King only appoints you a citizen if
you work for the Pope -- who is also the King. And because the King is all-powerful your
citizenship is at his whim. If you quit your job for the Pope, the King
-- who is also the pope -- will revoke your citizenship. These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't
have a real permanent population to speak of: there are only about 500 full citizens
-- which is fewer people that live in single skyscrapers in many countries -- and all these
citizens work for The Holy See as either Cardinals or Diplomats or the Pope's bodyguards or other
Catholic-related jobs. So it's best to think of Vatican City as a
kind of Sovereign Corporate Headquarters that grants temporary citizenship to its managers
rather than a real city-state like Singapore: which has a self-reproducing population of
citizens engaged in a variety of economic activities both of which Vatican City lacks. But in the end, the reason the world cares
about Vatican City is not because of the citizens within its walls but because of the billion
members of its church outside those walls.

**Transcript**:
The constant thud underneath your feet, the constrained space, and the monotony of going nowhere fast. It feels like hours have gone by,
but it's only been eleven minutes, and you wonder, "Why am I torturing myself? This thing has got to be considered 
a cruel and unusual punishment." Actually, that's exactly 
what it is, or was. You see, in the 1800s, treadmills were created 
to punish English prisoners. At the time, the English prison system
was abysmally bad. Execution and deportation
were often the punishments of choice, and those who were locked away
faced hours of solitude in filthy cells. So social movements led by
religious groups, philanthropies, and celebrities, like Charles Dickens, sought to change these dire conditions
and help reform the prisoners. When their movement succeeded, entire prisons were remodeled
and new forms of rehabilitation, such as the treadmill,
were introduced. Here's how the original version, invented in 1818 by English engineer 
Sir William Cubitt, worked. Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes
of a large paddle wheel. As the wheel turned, the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off, similar to modern stepper machines. Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water, crush grain, or power mills, which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated. These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape, and that added benefit of powering mills helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars. It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners. It's estimated that, on average, prisoners spent six 
or so hours a day on treadmills, the equivalent of climbing
5,000 to 14,000 feet. 14,000 feet is roughly 
Mount Everest's halfway point. Imagine doing that five days a week
with little food. Cubitt's idea quickly spread
across the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its creation, over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill, and America, a similar amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries, not that prison guards seemed to care. In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror," a quote many still agree with. And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century, when they were banned for being
excessively cruel under the Prison's Act of 1898. But of course the torture device
returned with a vengeance, this time targeting 
the unsuspecting public. In 1911, a treadmill patent 
was registered in the U.S., and by 1952, the forerunner for 
today's modern treadmill had been created. When the jogging craze 
hit the U.S. in the 1970s, the treadmill was thrust 
back into the limelight as an easy and convenient 
way to improve aerobic fitness, and lose unwanted pounds, which, to be fair, 
it's pretty good at doing. And the machine 
has maintained its popularity since. So the next time you voluntarily subject
yourself to what was once a cruel and unusual punishment, just be glad you can control
when you'll hop off.

across the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its creation, over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill, and America, a similar amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries, not that prison guards seemed to care. In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror," a quote many still agree with. And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century, when they were banned for being
excessively cruel under the Prison's Act of 1898. But of course the torture device
returned with a vengeance, this time targeting 
the unsuspecting public. In 1911, a treadmill patent 
was registered in the U.S., and by 1952, the forerunner for 
today's modern treadmill had been created. When the jogging craze 
hit the U.S. in the 1970s, the treadmill was thrust 
back into the limelight as an easy and convenient 
way to improve aerobic fitness, and lose unwanted pounds, which, to be fair, 
it's pretty good at doing. And the machine 
has maintained its popularity since. So the next time you voluntarily subject
yourself to what was once a cruel and unusual punishment, just be glad you can control

**Transcript**:
The constant thud underneath your feet, the constrained space, and the monotony of going nowhere fast. It feels like hours have gone by,
but it's only been eleven minutes, and you wonder, "Why am I torturing myself? This thing has got to be considered 
a cruel and unusual punishment." Actually, that's exactly 
what it is, or was. You see, in the 1800s, treadmills were created 
to punish English prisoners. At the time, the English prison system
was abysmally bad. Execution and deportation
were often the punishments of choice, and those who were locked away
faced hours of solitude in filthy cells. So social movements led by
religious groups, philanthropies, and celebrities, like Charles Dickens, sought to change these dire conditions
and help reform the prisoners. When their movement succeeded, entire prisons were remodeled
and new forms of rehabilitation, such as the treadmill,
were introduced. Here's how the original version, invented in 1818 by English engineer 
Sir William Cubitt, worked. Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes
of a large paddle wheel. As the wheel turned, the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off, similar to modern stepper machines. Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water, crush grain, or power mills, which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated. These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape, and that added benefit of powering mills helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars. It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners. It's estimated that, on average, prisoners spent six 
or so hours a day on treadmills, the equivalent of climbing
5,000 to 14,000 feet. 14,000 feet is roughly 
Mount Everest's halfway point. Imagine doing that five days a week
with little food. Cubitt's idea quickly spread
across the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its creation, over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill, and America, a similar amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined

**Transcript**:
The DNA in just one of your cells gets damaged tens of thousands 
of times per day. Multiply that by your body's
hundred trillion or so cells, and you've got a quintillion 
DNA errors everyday. And because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins 
your cells need to function, damage causes serious problems,
such as cancer. The errors come in different forms. Sometimes nucleotides, 
DNA's building blocks, get damaged, other times nucleotides 
get matched up incorrectly, causing mutations, and nicks in one or both strands
can interfere with DNA replication, or even cause sections 
of DNA to get mixed up. Fortunately, your cells have ways
of fixing most of these problems most of the time. These repair pathways 
all rely on specialized enzymes. Different ones respond 
to different types of damage. One common error is base mismatches. Each nucleotide contains a base, and during DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase
is supposed to bring in the right partner to pair with every base 
on each template strand. Adenine with thymine,
and guanine with cytosine. But about once every 
hundred thousand additions, it makes a mistake. The enzyme catches 
most of these right away, and cuts off a few nucleotides
and replaces them with the correct ones. And just in case it missed a few, a second set of proteins 
comes behind it to check. If they find a mismatch, they cut out the incorrect nucleotide
and replace it. This is called mismatch repair. Together, these two systems reduce
the number of base mismatch errors to about one in one billion. But DNA can get damaged
after replication, too. Lots of different molecules
can cause chemical changes to nucleotides. Some of these come 
from environmental exposure, like certain compounds in tobacco smoke. But others are molecules that are found
in cells naturally, like hydrogen peroxide. Certain chemical changes are so common that they have specific enzymes assigned
to reverse the damage. But the cell also has more general
repair pathways. If just one base is damaged, it can usually be fixed by a process
called base excision repair. One enzyme snips out the damaged base, and other enzymes come in to trim around
the site and replace the nucleotides. UV light can cause damage 
that's a little harder to fix. Sometimes, it causes two adjacent
nucleotides to stick together, distorting the DNA's double helix shape. Damage like this requires 
a more complex process called nucleotide excision repair. A team of proteins removes a long strand
of 24 or so nucleotides, and replaces them with fresh ones. Very high frequency radiation,
like gamma rays and x-rays, cause a different kind of damage. They can actually sever one 
or both strands of the DNA backbone. Double strand breaks
are the most dangerous. Even one can cause cell death. The two most common pathways
for repairing double strand breaks are called homologous recombination
and non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination uses an undamaged
section of similar DNA as a template. Enzymes interlace the damaged
and undamgaed strands, get them to exchange sequences
of nucleotides, and finally fill in the missing gaps to end up with two complete
double-stranded segments. Non-homologous end joining,
on the other hand, doesn't rely on a template. Instead, a series of proteins
trims off a few nucleotides and then fuses the broken ends 
back together. This process isn't as accurate. It can cause genes to get mixed up,
or moved around. But it's useful when 
sister DNA isn't available. Of course, changes to DNA 
aren't always bad. Beneficial mutations 
can allow a species to evolve. But most of the time, 
we want DNA to stay the same. Defects in DNA repair are associated
with premature aging and many kinds of cancer. So if you're looking for 
a fountain of youth, it's already operating in your cells, billions and billions of times a day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. Both questions are asking about the type of error that occurs when nucleotides are paired incorrectly. The correct answer to Question 3 is not explicitly listed, but based on the context of the transcript, the correct answer would be "Mutation" which is equivalent to "Incorrect pairing of bases" in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more similar question is not available in the generated MCQs. If a generated MCQ with options and content more similar to the ground truth MCQ were available, that would be the best match. But given the current options, Question 3 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
The DNA in just one of your cells gets damaged tens of thousands 
of times per day. Multiply that by your body's
hundred trillion or so cells, and you've got a quintillion 
DNA errors everyday. And because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins 
your cells need to function, damage causes serious problems,
such as cancer. The errors come in different forms. Sometimes nucleotides, 
DNA's building blocks, get damaged, other times nucleotides 
get matched up incorrectly, causing mutations, and nicks in one or both strands
can interfere with DNA replication, or even cause sections 
of DNA to get mixed up. Fortunately, your cells have ways
of fixing most of these problems most of the time. These repair pathways 
all rely on specialized enzymes. Different ones respond 
to different types of damage. One common error is base mismatches. Each nucleotide contains a base, and during DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase
is supposed to bring in the right partner to pair with every base 
on each template strand. Adenine with thymine,
and guanine with cytosine. But about once every 
hundred thousand additions, it makes a mistake. The enzyme catches 
most of these right away, and cuts off a few nucleotides
and replaces them with the correct ones. And just in case it missed a few, a second set of proteins 
comes behind it to check. If they find a mismatch, they cut out the incorrect nucleotide
and replace it. This is called mismatch repair. Together, these two systems reduce
the number of base mismatch errors to about one in one billion. But DNA can get damaged
after replication, too. Lots of different molecules
can cause chemical changes to nucleotides. Some of these come 
from environmental exposure, like certain compounds in tobacco smoke. But others are molecules that are found
in cells naturally, like hydrogen peroxide. Certain chemical changes are so common that they have specific enzymes assigned
to reverse the damage. But the cell also has more general
repair pathways. If just one base is damaged, it can usually be fixed by a process
called base excision repair. One enzyme snips out the damaged base, and other enzymes come in to trim around
the site and replace the nucleotides. UV light can cause damage 
that's a little harder to fix. Sometimes, it causes two adjacent
nucleotides to stick together, distorting the DNA's double helix shape. Damage like this requires 
a more complex process called nucleotide excision repair. A team of proteins removes a long strand
of 24 or so nucleotides, and replaces them with fresh ones. Very high frequency radiation,
like gamma rays and x-rays, cause a different kind of damage. They can actually sever one 
or both strands of the DNA backbone. Double strand breaks
are the most dangerous. Even one can cause cell death. The two most common pathways
for repairing double strand breaks are called homologous recombination
and non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination uses an undamaged
section of similar DNA as a template. Enzymes interlace the damaged
and undamgaed strands, get them to exchange sequences
of nucleotides, and finally fill in the missing gaps to end up with two complete
double-stranded segments. Non-homologous end joining,
on the other hand, doesn't rely on a template. Instead, a series of proteins
trims off a few nucleotides and then fuses the broken ends 
back together. This process isn't as accurate. It can cause genes to get mixed up,
or moved around. But it's useful when 
sister DNA isn't available. Of course, changes to DNA 
aren't always bad. Beneficial mutations 
can allow a species to evolve. But most of the time, 
we want DNA to stay the same. Defects in DNA repair are associated
with premature aging and many kinds of cancer. So if you're looking for 
a fountain of youth, it's already operating in your cells, billions and billions of times a day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options provided. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of tobacco smoke on DNA, and the correct option is "chemical changes to nucleotides." Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the effect of tobacco smoke. However, Question 6 mentions UV light causing damage to DNA, and Question 7 mentions gamma rays and x-rays causing double-strand breaks.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6 or Question 7, as they both deal with the effects of external factors on DNA. However, neither of these questions directly addresses the effect of tobacco smoke.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

I'm 52 years old. I'm serving a 15-year sentence
for assaulting my wife. My name is Louis, 35.
I sold narcotics
[clears throat]
since I was about 13 or so. My name is Juan.
I'm 34 years old. I'm here
for second degree murder.
Yeah. Sadly, this is my charge. My name is Celine.
I'm 39.
I'll be 40 soon. I was given a life term. [♪ music ♪] A lot of times
what lands people in prison [Fleet Maull -
Prison Mindfulness Institute] and what brings them back
is a lack
of good problem-solving skills and good communication skills. [♪ music ♪] [Richman] Fleet approached
us asking if he could
do some work in here. We were challenged. Our union wanted to know
how we could possibly bring
an ex-offender in. [Maull] I served 14½ years
on a 25-year,
no parole sentence. Hello. [♪ music ♪] Having served 14 years
boosts his credibility— boosts his credibility
with inmates. How's your week been?
- It's good. [Maull] Yeah? Good.
What's up? Yeah.
Hey. Welcome. When I got locked up,
I really hit a wall
of just seeing the craziness
of my life path up until then
and the incredible
selfish decisions
I'd been making. My son was 9 years old.
He was going
to grow up without his dad. And I was just so deeply
full of remorse and regret that I just literally
started practicing meditation
like my hair was on fire. So I became extremely
motivated to turn
my life around. [♪ music ♪] And so I was living
the life of this prison monk. [♪ music ♪] I was sourcing
a meditation group
twice a week in the chapel. [♪ music ♪] I started receiving letters
from prisoners
while I was in prison. I had published some articles;
people knew about me
out in the world a little bit, and they started
sending some of these letters
to me thinking I would know
what to do with them. I worked in
the education department,
and I had access
to a copy machine. I would copy articles
out of books,
and I'd put together
a little thing and I'd send it off
to a prisoner. So it started off that way,
and I decided it was
a much bigger deal than I could do
from my prison cells. I think we have
a co-creative relationship
with our life. We can't control other people,
we don't control life, but is there some relationship
between what we put out
and what comes back? Freedom before I came here
was just another word. I had never been
to prison before. All you know is what the media
and the movies
say about prison— "Take care of yourself, man." "Somebody's going to try
to take your manhood
or something."
You know what I mean? I'm thinking I'm going
to come in here
and fight the world. [Maull] In a prison like Moran,
there's a serious conflict
waiting around any corner. It's an environment
where people's worst behaviors
are just right there just under the surface. [♪ music ♪] When I first came in,
I fought with officers,
would beat up anyone, would do the unthinkable
just because. [Dennis] It's a vicious cycle
because once you come to prison your life just keeps tumbling,
tumbling, tumbling, and it's like
a never-ending wall
that won't stop building unless you find some way
to get over that wall
or at least in front of it. [Richman] What circumstances
did they have
to survive on the street to bring them
to where they are now? Do we want to save those lives,
or do we want to discard them? The crimes I committed,
I brought shame
to not only myself
but to those who I love. So I'm just really trying
to do something
to get out of that cycle. Somebody's given us
an opportunity just
to meditate
and connect ourselves, and that's golden. So sit up with
that good posture,
just rest your hands
on your legs, and just take
a moment to just feel. [♪ music ♪] [Richman] I've always
thought that the people
who survive are so much stronger
than I could ever be. I asked Fleet how he survived
and thrived the way he has. He credits meditation
for having given him
the strength to live
his life in prison and come out not as much
the worse for wear
as most people do. I don't have a release date. So I can only go home
when they decide I can. So I learned to live
day by day,
and that helped me
to deal with prison, and I could only
do that being in the moment,
being in the now. [♪ music ♪] It's like if I don't like
what's going on,
what can I do to shift it? If I don't like
the relationship I have
with my boss or with one
of the COs or something, could I approach
that person
in a different way? Can I get creative
about what I'm doing
to bring about a shift
in the way things are— in other words,
owning my own situation. So how do you resolve that? I take a breath and then
[chuckles] I step back.
Really, you have to. [Maull] Then suddenly
get that there's
this whole thing there that they thought
was who they are. That's the only
reality they knew. Suddenly they get to step
outside of that a little bit. You just see the lights go on. It's like
this sudden illumination.
It's like
a mini enlightenment of sorts. And that's very powerful.
That's what keeps me coming. The reality of it
is I'm living life, and meditation
it has brought
a new perspective in the way that it gave me
like a tool
to really look inside myself and change the way I am. [Richman] People don't
understand the value
of what they call
the soft stuff, and I sometimes think
without the soft stuff,
no matter how much
hard stuff you have, you're bound to fail. You can live your life.
You can be yourself. You can show others
that this isn't a place
to breed a better criminal; this could actually
be a place to breed
a better person. You're here
because the way that you were
didn't work. So why not be better? [prisoners chattering] [Richman] The people
in prison are us. They're not monsters. And more importantly,
whether we want them to or not, they're getting out. So do you want them
to come out angrier
and meaner and more dangerous than they were
when they came in, or do you want
to do whatever you can
to change their behavior
while they're here? We need people to see
and experience prisoners
stepping out of that culture and doing something
transformative with their lives, and then people
will start to have faith, people will see people
coming back to their community and they realize these
are human beings
and that human beings'
lives have value and they're not expendable. [♪ music ♪] [This year 700,000 people

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of Americans currently behind bars, which is mentioned in the transcript as "1 out of every 100 Americans is currently behind bars."

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8: Factual question: How many people will return home from prison this year, according to the transcript? Options: A. 100,000, B. 500,000, C. 700,000, D. 1,000,000

Although this question does not ask about the number of Americans currently behind bars, it does ask about a related statistic mentioned in the transcript. However, I must note that the intent and content of this question are not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 8 is the most similar, but I want to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

murderers and rapists,

everybody. [1 out of every 100 Americans
is currently behind bars] My name is Dennis.
I'm 52 years old. I'm serving a 15-year sentence
for assaulting my wife. My name is Louis, 35.
I sold narcotics
[clears throat]
since I was about 13 or so. My name is Juan.
I'm 34 years old. I'm here

us asking if he could
do some work in here. We were challenged. Our union wanted to know
how we could possibly bring
an ex-offender in. [Maull] I served 14½ years
on a 25-year,
no parole sentence. Hello. [♪ music ♪] Having served 14 years
boosts his credibility— boosts his credibility
with inmates. How's your week been?
- It's good. [Maull] Yeah? Good.
What's up? Yeah.
Hey. Welcome. When I got locked up,
I really hit a wall
of just seeing the craziness
of my life path up until then
and the incredible
selfish decisions
I'd been making. My son was 9 years old.
He was going
to grow up without his dad. And I was just so deeply
full of remorse and regret that I just literally
started practicing meditation
like my hair was on fire. So I became extremely
motivated to turn
my life around. [♪ music ♪] And so I was living
the life of this prison monk. [♪ music ♪] I was sourcing
a meditation group
twice a week in the chapel. [♪ music ♪] I started receiving letters
from prisoners
while I was in prison. I had published some articles;
people knew about me
out in the world a little bit, and they started
sending some of these letters
to me thinking I would know
what to do with them. I worked in
the education department,
and I had access
to a copy machine. I would copy articles
out of books,
and I'd put together
a little thing and I'd send it off
to a prisoner. So it started off that way,
and I decided it was
a much bigger deal than I could do
from my prison cells. I think we have
a co-creative relationship
with our life. We can't control other people,
we don't control life, but is there some relationship
between what we put out
and what comes back? Freedom before I came here
was just another word. I had never been
to prison before. All you know is what the media
and the movies
say about prison— "Take care of yourself, man." "Somebody's going to try
to take your manhood
or something."
You know what I mean? I'm thinking I'm going
to come in here
and fight the world. [Maull] In a prison like Moran,
there's a serious conflict
waiting around any corner. It's an environment
where people's worst behaviors
are just right there just under the surface. [♪ music ♪] When I first came in,
I fought with officers,
would beat up anyone, would do the unthinkable
just because. [Dennis] It's a vicious cycle
because once you come to prison your life just keeps tumbling,
tumbling, tumbling, and it's like
a never-ending wall
that won't stop building unless you find some way
to get over that wall
or at least in front of it. [Richman] What circumstances
did they have
to survive on the street to bring them
to where they are now? Do we want to save those lives,
or do we want to discard them? The crimes I committed,
I brought shame
to not only myself
but to those who I love. So I'm just really trying
to do something
to get out of that cycle. Somebody's given us
an opportunity just
to meditate
and connect ourselves, and that's golden. So sit up with
that good posture,
just rest your hands
on your legs, and just take
a moment to just feel. [♪ music ♪] [Richman] I've always
thought that the people
who survive are so much stronger
than I could ever be. I asked Fleet how he survived
and thrived the way he has. He credits meditation
for having given him
the strength to live
his life in prison and come out not as much
the worse for wear
as most people do. I don't have a release date. So I can only go home
when they decide I can. So I learned to live
day by day,
and that helped me
to deal with prison, and I could only
do that being in the moment,
being in the now. [♪ music ♪] It's like if I don't like
what's going on,
what can I do to shift it? If I don't like
the relationship I have
with my boss or with one
of the COs or something, could I approach
that person
in a different way? Can I get creative
about what I'm doing
to bring about a shift
in the way things are— in other words,
owning my own situation. So how do you resolve that? I take a breath and then
[chuckles] I step back.
Really, you have to. [Maull] Then suddenly
get that there's
this whole thing there that they thought
was who they are. That's the only
reality they knew. Suddenly they get to step
outside of that a little bit. You just see the lights go on. It's like
this sudden illumination.
It's like
a mini enlightenment of sorts. And that's very powerful.
That's what keeps me coming. The reality of it
is I'm living life, and meditation
it has brought
a new perspective in the way that it gave me
like a tool
to really look inside myself and change the way I am. [Richman] People don't
understand the value
of what they call
the soft stuff, and I sometimes think
without the soft stuff,
no matter how much
hard stuff you have, you're bound to fail. You can live your life.
You can be yourself. You can show others
that this isn't a place
to breed a better criminal; this could actually
be a place to breed
a better person. You're here
because the way that you were
didn't work. So why not be better? [prisoners chattering] [Richman] The people
in prison are us. They're not monsters. And more importantly,
whether we want them to or not, they're getting out. So do you want them
to come out angrier
and meaner and more dangerous than they were
when they came in, or do you want
to do whatever you can
to change their behavior
while they're here? We need people to see
and experience prisoners
stepping out of that culture and doing something
transformative with their lives, and then people
will start to have faith, people will see people
coming back to their community and they realize these
are human beings
and that human beings'
lives have value and they're not expendable. [♪ music ♪] [This year 700,000 people

with inmates. How's your week been?
- It's good. [Maull] Yeah? Good.
What's up? Yeah.
Hey. Welcome. When I got locked up,
I really hit a wall
of just seeing the craziness
of my life path up until then
and the incredible
selfish decisions
I'd been making. My son was 9 years old.
He was going
to grow up without his dad. And I was just so deeply
full of remorse and regret that I just literally
started practicing meditation
like my hair was on fire. So I became extremely
motivated to turn
my life around. [♪ music ♪] And so I was living
the life of this prison monk. [♪ music ♪] I was sourcing
a meditation group
twice a week in the chapel. [♪ music ♪] I started receiving letters
from prisoners
while I was in prison. I had published some articles;
people knew about me
out in the world a little bit, and they started
sending some of these letters
to me thinking I would know
what to do with them. I worked in
the education department,
and I had access
to a copy machine. I would copy articles
out of books,
and I'd put together
a little thing and I'd send it off
to a prisoner. So it started off that way,
and I decided it was
a much bigger deal than I could do
from my prison cells. I think we have
a co-creative relationship
with our life. We can't control other people,
we don't control life, but is there some relationship
between what we put out
and what comes back? Freedom before I came here
was just another word. I had never been
to prison before. All you know is what the media
and the movies
say about prison— "Take care of yourself, man." "Somebody's going to try
to take your manhood
or something."
You know what I mean? I'm thinking I'm going
to come in here
and fight the world. [Maull] In a prison like Moran,
there's a serious conflict
waiting around any corner. It's an environment
where people's worst behaviors
are just right there just under the surface. [♪ music ♪] When I first came in,
I fought with officers,
would beat up anyone, would do the unthinkable
just because. [Dennis] It's a vicious cycle
because once you come to prison your life just keeps tumbling,
tumbling, tumbling, and it's like
a never-ending wall
that won't stop building unless you find some way
to get over that wall
or at least in front of it. [Richman] What circumstances
did they have
to survive on the street to bring them
to where they are now? Do we want to save those lives,
or do we want to discard them? The crimes I committed,
I brought shame
to not only myself
but to those who I love. So I'm just really trying
to do something
to get out of that cycle. Somebody's given us
an opportunity just
to meditate
and connect ourselves, and that's golden. So sit up with
that good posture,
just rest your hands
on your legs, and just take
a moment to just feel. [♪ music ♪] [Richman] I've always
thought that the people
who survive are so much stronger
than I could ever be. I asked Fleet how he survived
and thrived the way he has. He credits meditation
for having given him
the strength to live
his life in prison and come out not as much
the worse for wear
as most people do. I don't have a release date. So I can only go home
when they decide I can. So I learned to live
day by day,
and that helped me
to deal with prison, and I could only
do that being in the moment,
being in the now. [♪ music ♪] It's like if I don't like
what's going on,
what can I do to shift it? If I don't like
the relationship I have
with my boss or with one
of the COs or something, could I approach
that person
in a different way? Can I get creative
about what I'm doing
to bring about a shift
in the way things are— in other words,
owning my own situation. So how do you resolve that? I take a breath and then
[chuckles] I step back.
Really, you have to. [Maull] Then suddenly
get that there's
this whole thing there that they thought
was who they are. That's the only
reality they knew. Suddenly they get to step
outside of that a little bit. You just see the lights go on. It's like
this sudden illumination.
It's like
a mini enlightenment of sorts. And that's very powerful.
That's what keeps me coming. The reality of it
is I'm living life, and meditation
it has brought
a new perspective in the way that it gave me
like a tool
to really look inside myself and change the way I am. [Richman] People don't
understand the value
of what they call
the soft stuff, and I sometimes think
without the soft stuff,
no matter how much
hard stuff you have, you're bound to fail. You can live your life.
You can be yourself. You can show others
that this isn't a place
to breed a better criminal; this could actually
be a place to breed
a better person. You're here
because the way that you were
didn't work. So why not be better? [prisoners chattering] [Richman] The people
in prison are us. They're not monsters. And more importantly,
whether we want them to or not, they're getting out. So do you want them
to come out angrier
and meaner and more dangerous than they were
when they came in, or do you want
to do whatever you can
to change their behavior
while they're here? We need people to see
and experience prisoners
stepping out of that culture and doing something
transformative with their lives, and then people
will start to have faith, people will see people
coming back to their community and they realize these
are human beings
and that human beings'
lives have value and they're not expendable. [♪ music ♪] [This year 700,000 people

**Transcript**:
This may look like a neatly arranged
stack of numbers, but it's actually
a mathematical treasure trove. Indian mathematicians called it 
the Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world,
it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair
since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so 
intrigued mathematicians the world over? In short, 
it's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern
that generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible
zeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs, 
and you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up 
with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle 
goes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called
the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients, 
or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row
of Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3,
which expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way
to look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up 
the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number
as part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is
(1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens
when you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561,
which is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting:
all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal
are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them 
into equilateral triangles. The next diagonal 
has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack
that many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this:
shade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much
when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal 
known as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just 
a mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes 
to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family 
of three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds 
to girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number 
corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number 
is what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum 
of all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly 
picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups 
of five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would
be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth 
element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly 
interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets
to this day. For example, mathematicians recently 
discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the triangle in Iran. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 1, which asks about the name of the triangle in the Western world. Although the specific region is different, both questions are asking about the name of the triangle in a particular region.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. But if I had to choose, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, although it's not a direct match.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would suggest generating new MCQs that directly match the ground truth MCQs.

**Transcript**:
This may look like a neatly arranged
stack of numbers, but it's actually
a mathematical treasure trove. Indian mathematicians called it 
the Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world,
it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair
since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so 
intrigued mathematicians the world over? In short, 
it's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern
that generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible
zeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs, 
and you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up 
with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle 
goes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called
the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients, 
or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row
of Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3,
which expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way
to look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up 
the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number
as part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is
(1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens
when you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561,
which is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting:
all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal
are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them 
into equilateral triangles. The next diagonal 
has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack
that many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this:
shade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much
when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal 
known as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just 
a mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes 
to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family 
of three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds 
to girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number 
corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number 
is what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum 
of all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly 
picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups 
of five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would
be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth 
element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly 
interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets
to this day. For example, mathematicians recently 
discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content related to Pascal's Triangle, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5, as it discusses a property of the triangle related to powers of 11, similar to the ground truth MCQ discussing 11^3.

However, this is still a weak match since Question 5 does not directly ask about the row corresponding to a specific power of 11.

If I had to choose, I would say Question 5 is the closest match, but I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
This just in: "Thief robs town 
with world's largest chocolate bunny." Wait, so are we talking about this, or this? That's a classic case 
of a misplaced modifier, a common grammatical mistake that can dramatically change 
the meaning of a sentence. And lest you think 
this is a bit far-fetched, confusing headlines like this
appear all the time. Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses that add information 
about other parts of a sentence, which is usually helpful. But when modifiers
aren't linked clearly enough to the words 
they're actually referring to, they can create unintentional ambiguity. That happens because the modifying words, in this case, 
"with world's largest chocolate bunny," modify the wrong thing,
the robber's actions instead of the town. To correct this particular sentence,
we simply rephrase to make it clearer what the modifying 
phrase is talking about. "Town with world's largest chocolate bunny
robbed by thief." Now, at least it's clear that the thief wasn't armed 
with a giant chocolate animal. Sometimes, modifying words, 
phrases, or clauses don't appear to be modifying 
anything at all. That's called a dangling modifier. "Having robbed the bank in record time, it was possible to make off 
with the town's chocolate rabbit as well." The modifying phrase in this sentence
seems unrelated to anything else, and so we're clueless about who the chocolate-loving criminal 
could possibly be. Giving the modifier something to modify
will solve the problem. Then there's another group
called the squinting modifiers because they're stuck between two things
and could feasibly refer to either. Often, these modifiers are adverbs,
like the one in this sentence: "Robbers who steal chocolate bunnies
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers." "Rapidly" is the modifier, here,
but what's not clear is whether it's referring 
to the speed of the chocolate thievery, or how quickly it alerts 
the furious onlookers. To clarify, we can either put the modifier
closer to its intended phrase, which works in some cases, or we can entirely reword the sentence
so that the modifier no longer squints, but clearly applies to only one part. "Chocolate bunny-thieving robbers
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers." Justice will eventually come 
to the chocolate thief, but in the meantime, our task is to avoid verbal ambiguity by making it clear which parts 
of the sentences modifiers belong to. That way, we can at least maintain
grammatical law and order.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 9 deal with the effect of modifiers on sentence meaning, specifically when they create problems.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, both questions have an option that mentions the potential for modifiers to change the meaning of a sentence (Ground Truth MCQ: "When they modify the wrong thing", Question 9: "It can dramatically change the meaning of a sentence").
- Content: Both questions address the issue of modifiers creating ambiguity or altering the intended meaning of a sentence.

While not an exact match, Question 9 is the closest in terms of intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Where did Russia come from, why is it so big, and what are the differences 
between it and its neighbors? The answers lie in an epic story
of seafaring warriors, nomadic invaders, and the rise and fall of a medieval state
known as Kievan Rus. In the first millennium, a large group of tribes spread through
the dense woodlands of Eastern Europe. Because they had no writing system, much of what we know about them
comes from three main sources: archaeological evidence, accounts from literate scholars 
of the Roman Empire and the Middle East, and, lastly, an epic history called 
the Primary Chronicle compiled in the 12th century 
by a monk named Nestor. What they tell us is that these tribes
who shared a common Slavic language and polytheistic religion had by the 7th century split into
western, southern and eastern branches, the latter stretching from 
the Dniester River to the Volga and the Baltic Sea. As Nestor's story goes, after years of
subjugation by Vikings from the north, who, by the way, did not wear 
horned helmets in battle, the region's tribes revolted
and drove back the Northmen, but left to their own devices, 
they turned on each other. Such chaos ensued that, ironically, the tribes reached out to the foreigners
they had just expelled, inviting them to return 
and establish order. The Vikings accepted, sending a prince
named Rurik and his two brothers to rule. With Rurik's son, Oleg, 
expanding his realm into the south, and moving the capitol to Kiev, a former outpost of the Khazar Empire, the Kievan Rus was born, "Rus" most likely deriving from 
an old Norse word for "the men who row." The new princedom had complex relations
with its neighbors, alternating between alliance and warfare
with the Khazar and Byzantine Empires, as well as neighboring tribes. Religion played an important 
role in politics, and as the legend goes, in 987, the Rus prince Vladamir I decided
it was time to abandon Slavic paganism, and sent emissaries 
to explore neighboring faiths. Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol and Judaism's expulsion 
from its holy land, the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity after hearing odd accounts 
of its ceremonies. With Vladimir's conversion and marriage
to the Byzantine emperor's sister, as well as continued trade 
along the Volga route, the relationship between 
the two civilizations deepened. Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet
for Slavic languages based on a modified Greek script while Rus Viking warriors served as the
Byzantine Emperor's elite guard. For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished
from its rich resources and trade. Its noblemen and noblewomen married
prominent European rulers, while residents of some cities 
enjoyed great culture, literacy, and even democratic freedoms 
uncommon for the time. But nothing lasts forever. Fratricidal disputes over succession
began to erode central power as increasingly independent cities
ruled by rival princes vied for control. The Fourth Crusade 
and decline of Constantinople devastated the trade integral 
to Rus wealth and power, while Teutonic crusaders 
threatened northern territories. The final blow, however, would 
come from the east. Consumed by their squabbles, Rus princes paid little attention 
to the rumors of a mysterious unstoppable hoard until 1237, when 35,000 mounted 
archers led by Batu Khan swept through the Rus cities, sacking Kiev before continuing 
on to Hungary and Poland. The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,
its people now divided. In the east, which remained 
under Mongol rule, a remote trading post, known as Moscow, would grow to challenge 
the power of the Khans, conquering parts 
of their fragmenting empire, and, in many ways, succeeding it. As it absorbed other 
eastern Rus territories, it reclaimed the old name 
in its Greek form, Ruscia. Meanwhile, the western regions
whose leaders had avoided destruction through political maneuvering 
until the hoard withdrew came under the influence of Poland
and Lithuania. For the next few centuries, the former lands of Kievan Rus populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols would develop differences in society,
culture and language that remain to the present day.

they turned on each other. Such chaos ensued that, ironically, the tribes reached out to the foreigners
they had just expelled, inviting them to return 
and establish order. The Vikings accepted, sending a prince
named Rurik and his two brothers to rule. With Rurik's son, Oleg, 
expanding his realm into the south, and moving the capitol to Kiev, a former outpost of the Khazar Empire, the Kievan Rus was born, "Rus" most likely deriving from 
an old Norse word for "the men who row." The new princedom had complex relations
with its neighbors, alternating between alliance and warfare
with the Khazar and Byzantine Empires, as well as neighboring tribes. Religion played an important 
role in politics, and as the legend goes, in 987, the Rus prince Vladamir I decided
it was time to abandon Slavic paganism, and sent emissaries 
to explore neighboring faiths. Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol and Judaism's expulsion 
from its holy land, the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity after hearing odd accounts 
of its ceremonies. With Vladimir's conversion and marriage
to the Byzantine emperor's sister, as well as continued trade 
along the Volga route, the relationship between 
the two civilizations deepened. Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet
for Slavic languages based on a modified Greek script while Rus Viking warriors served as the
Byzantine Emperor's elite guard. For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished
from its rich resources and trade. Its noblemen and noblewomen married
prominent European rulers, while residents of some cities 
enjoyed great culture, literacy, and even democratic freedoms 
uncommon for the time. But nothing lasts forever. Fratricidal disputes over succession
began to erode central power as increasingly independent cities
ruled by rival princes vied for control. The Fourth Crusade 
and decline of Constantinople devastated the trade integral 
to Rus wealth and power, while Teutonic crusaders 
threatened northern territories. The final blow, however, would 
come from the east. Consumed by their squabbles, Rus princes paid little attention 
to the rumors of a mysterious unstoppable hoard until 1237, when 35,000 mounted 
archers led by Batu Khan swept through the Rus cities, sacking Kiev before continuing 
on to Hungary and Poland. The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,
its people now divided. In the east, which remained 
under Mongol rule, a remote trading post, known as Moscow, would grow to challenge 
the power of the Khans, conquering parts 
of their fragmenting empire, and, in many ways, succeeding it. As it absorbed other 
eastern Rus territories, it reclaimed the old name 
in its Greek form, Ruscia. Meanwhile, the western regions
whose leaders had avoided destruction through political maneuvering 
until the hoard withdrew came under the influence of Poland
and Lithuania. For the next few centuries, the former lands of Kievan Rus populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols would develop differences in society,
culture and language that remain to the present day.

**Transcript**:
Packed inside every cell in your body
is a set of genetic instructions, 3.2 billion base pairs long. Deciphering these directions
would be a monumental task but could offer unprecedented insight
about the human body. In 1990, a consortium 
of 20 international research centers embarked on the world's largest
biological collaboration to accomplish this mission. The Human Genome Project proposed
to sequence the entire human genome over 15 years 
with $3 billion of public funds. Then, seven years 
before its scheduled completion, a private company called Celera announced
that they could accomplish the same goal in just three years
and at a fraction of the cost. The two camps discussed a joint venture,
but talks quickly fell apart as disagreements arose over legal
and ethical issues of genetic property. And so the race began. Though both teams used the same technology
to sequence the entire human genome, it was their strategies 
that made all the difference. Their paths diverged 
in the most critical of steps: the first one. In the Human Genome Project's approach, the genome was first divided into smaller,
more manageable chunks about 150,000 base pairs long that overlapped each other
a little bit on both ends. Each of these fragments of DNA was inserted inside a bacterial 
artificial chromosome where they were cloned and fingerprinted. The fingerprints showed scientists
where the fragments overlapped without knowing the actual sequence. Using the overlapping bits as a guide, the researchers marked 
each fragment's place in the genome to create a contiguous map, a process that took about six years. The cloned fragments were sequenced
in labs around the world following one of the project's
two major principles: that collaboration on our shared heritage
was open to all nations. In each case, the fragments 
were arbitrarily broken up into small, overlapping pieces
about 1,000 base pairs long. Then, using a technology 
called the Sanger method, each piece was sequenced letter by letter. This rigorous map-based approach
called hierarchical shotgun sequencing minimized the risk of misassembly, a huge hazard of sequencing genomes
with many repetitive portions, like the human genome. The consortium's 
"better safe than sorry" approach contrasted starkly with Celera's strategy
called whole genome shotgun sequencing. It hinged on skipping 
the mapping phase entirely, a faster, though foolhardy, approach
according to some. The entire genome was directly chopped up into a giant heap 
of small, overlapping bits. Once these bits were sequenced
via the Sanger method, Celera would take the formidable risk
of reconstructing the genome using just the overlaps. But perhaps their decision
wasn't such a gamble because guess whose freshly completed map
was available online for free? The Human Genome Consortium, in accordance with 
the project's second major principle which held that all of the project's data would be shared publicly
within 24 hours of collection. So in 1998, scientists around the world were furiously sequencing 
lines of genetic code using the tried and true, yet laborious,
Sanger method. Finally, after three exhausting years
of continuous sequencing and assembling, the verdict was in. In February 2001, both groups 
simultaneously published working drafts of more than 90%
of the human genome, several years ahead 
of the consortium's schedule. The race ended in a tie. The Human Genome Project's practice
of immediately sharing its data was an unusual one. It is more typical for scientists
to closely guard their data until they are able to analyze it
and publish their conclusions. Instead, the Human Genome Project
accelerated the pace of research and created an international
collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Since then, robust investment in both
the public and private sector has led to the identification
of many disease related genes and remarkable advances 
in sequencing technology. Today, a person's genome can be sequenced
in just a few days. However, reading the genome 
is only the first step. We're a long way away from understanding
what most of our genes do and how they are controlled. Those are some of the challenges for the next generation 
of ambitious research initiatives.

**Transcript**:
Packed inside every cell in your body
is a set of genetic instructions, 3.2 billion base pairs long. Deciphering these directions
would be a monumental task but could offer unprecedented insight
about the human body. In 1990, a consortium 
of 20 international research centers embarked on the world's largest
biological collaboration to accomplish this mission. The Human Genome Project proposed
to sequence the entire human genome over 15 years 
with $3 billion of public funds. Then, seven years 
before its scheduled completion, a private company called Celera announced
that they could accomplish the same goal in just three years
and at a fraction of the cost. The two camps discussed a joint venture,
but talks quickly fell apart as disagreements arose over legal
and ethical issues of genetic property. And so the race began. Though both teams used the same technology
to sequence the entire human genome, it was their strategies 
that made all the difference. Their paths diverged 
in the most critical of steps: the first one. In the Human Genome Project's approach, the genome was first divided into smaller,
more manageable chunks about 150,000 base pairs long that overlapped each other
a little bit on both ends. Each of these fragments of DNA was inserted inside a bacterial 
artificial chromosome where they were cloned and fingerprinted. The fingerprints showed scientists
where the fragments overlapped without knowing the actual sequence. Using the overlapping bits as a guide, the researchers marked 
each fragment's place in the genome to create a contiguous map, a process that took about six years. The cloned fragments were sequenced
in labs around the world following one of the project's
two major principles: that collaboration on our shared heritage
was open to all nations. In each case, the fragments 
were arbitrarily broken up into small, overlapping pieces
about 1,000 base pairs long. Then, using a technology 
called the Sanger method, each piece was sequenced letter by letter. This rigorous map-based approach
called hierarchical shotgun sequencing minimized the risk of misassembly, a huge hazard of sequencing genomes
with many repetitive portions, like the human genome. The consortium's 
"better safe than sorry" approach contrasted starkly with Celera's strategy
called whole genome shotgun sequencing. It hinged on skipping 
the mapping phase entirely, a faster, though foolhardy, approach
according to some. The entire genome was directly chopped up into a giant heap 
of small, overlapping bits. Once these bits were sequenced
via the Sanger method, Celera would take the formidable risk
of reconstructing the genome using just the overlaps. But perhaps their decision
wasn't such a gamble because guess whose freshly completed map
was available online for free? The Human Genome Consortium, in accordance with 
the project's second major principle which held that all of the project's data would be shared publicly
within 24 hours of collection. So in 1998, scientists around the world were furiously sequencing 
lines of genetic code using the tried and true, yet laborious,
Sanger method. Finally, after three exhausting years
of continuous sequencing and assembling, the verdict was in. In February 2001, both groups 
simultaneously published working drafts of more than 90%
of the human genome, several years ahead 
of the consortium's schedule. The race ended in a tie. The Human Genome Project's practice
of immediately sharing its data was an unusual one. It is more typical for scientists
to closely guard their data until they are able to analyze it
and publish their conclusions. Instead, the Human Genome Project
accelerated the pace of research and created an international
collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Since then, robust investment in both
the public and private sector has led to the identification
of many disease related genes and remarkable advances 
in sequencing technology. Today, a person's genome can be sequenced
in just a few days. However, reading the genome 
is only the first step. We're a long way away from understanding
what most of our genes do and how they are controlled. Those are some of the challenges for the next generation 
of ambitious research initiatives.

Translator: Jennifer Cody
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems
to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: "Be more confident." And most likely, this is what you think
when you hear it: "If only it were that simple." But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,
worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes
when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously 
to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors 
that impact confidence. One: what you're born with,
such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance
of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures
of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about 
and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle
these three factors, but the personal choices we make
certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind 
a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate
our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you
an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success 
when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music
with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose
or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,
like a muscle? These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents
are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered 
something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset
and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity
to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get
stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset
are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better 
in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by
twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter." The Wright Brothers built on history's
failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly
and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond 
to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try 
different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge 
you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, 
stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that
whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge
and understanding. This is confidence.

Translator: Jennifer Cody
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems
to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: "Be more confident." And most likely, this is what you think
when you hear it: "If only it were that simple." But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,
worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes
when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously 
to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors 
that impact confidence. One: what you're born with,
such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance
of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures
of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about 
and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle
these three factors, but the personal choices we make
certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind 
a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate
our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you
an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success 
when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music
with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose
or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,
like a muscle? These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents
are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered 
something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset
and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity
to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get
stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset
are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better 
in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by
twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter." The Wright Brothers built on history's
failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly
and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond 
to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try 
different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge 
you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, 
stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that
whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge
and understanding. This is confidence.

Where the Sidewalk Ends, by Shel Silverstein.

Let us leave this place where the smoke
blows black And the dark street winds and bends. Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, And watch where the chalk-white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends.

**Transcript**:
Where the Sidewalk Ends, by Shel Silverstein. There is a place where the sidewalk ends And before the street begins, And there the grass grows soft and white, And there the sun burns crimson bright, And there the moon-bird rests from his flight To cool in the peppermint wind. Let us leave this place where the smoke
blows black And the dark street winds and bends. Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, And watch where the chalk-white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends. Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, For the children, they mark, and the children, they know The place where the sidewalk ends.

**Transcript**:
Compared to the whitewater streams that tumble
down mountainsides, the meandering rivers of the plains may seem tame and lazy. But
mountain streams are corralled by the steep-walled valleys they carve – their courses are literally
set in stone. Out on the open plains, those stony walls give way to soft soil, allowing
rivers much more freedom to shift their banks and set their own ever-changing courses to
the sea: courses that almost never run straight. At least not for long, because all it takes
to turn a straight stretch of river into a bendy one is a little disturbance and a lot
of time  – and in nature, there’s plenty of both.
      Say, for example, that a muskrat  burrows
herself a den in one bank of a stream. Her tunnels make for a cozy home,  but they also
weaken the bank, which eventually begins to crumble and slump into the stream. Water rushes into the newly-formed hollow,
sweeping away loose dirt and making the hollow even hollower, which lets the water rush a
little faster and sweep away a little more dirt from the bank...and so on, and so on
. As more of the stream’s flow is diverted
into the deepening hole on one bank and away from the other side of the channel, the flow
there weakens and slows. And since slow-moving water can’t carry the sand-sized particles
that fast-moving water can, that dirt drops to the bottom and builds up to make the water
there shallower and slower, and then keeps accumulating until the edge of the stream
becomes new land on the inside bank.        
Meanwhile, the fast-moving water near the outside bank sweeps out of the curve with
enough momentum to carry it across the channel and slam it into the other side, where it
starts to carve another curve . And then another, and then another, and then another. The wider
the stream, the longer it takes the slingshotting current to reach the other side, and the greater
the downstream distance to the next curve. In fact, measurements of meandering streams
all over the world reveal a strikingly regular pattern : the length of one S-shaped meander
tends to be about six times the width of the channel . So little tiny meandering streams
tend to look just like miniature versions of their bigger relatives.
     As long as nothing gets in the way of a river’s
meandering , its curves will continue to grow curvier and curvier until they loop around
and bumble into themselves. When that happens, the river follows the straighter path downhill,
leaving behind a crescent-shaped remnant called an oxbow lake. Or a billabong. Or a lago en
herradura. Or a bras mort ...     
We have lots of names for these lakes, since they can occur pretty much anywhere liquid
flows – which brings up an interesting question:

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been gazing at a starry sky when suddenly 
a bright dot glided into view? If it wasn't blinking, then you've had
the distinct pleasure of seeing one of mankind's greatest 
collaborative feats with your own eyes: The International Space Station. Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,
and weighing more than 320 cars, the International Space Station 
is so large that no single rocket could have 
lifted it into orbit. Instead, it was assembled piece by piece while hurtling through space
at 28,000 kilometers per hour, lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes. It all started when sixteen nations signed the Space Station 
Intergovernmental Agreement, laying out each partner's 
expected contributions to the ISS, from modules and maintenance
to sharing information and finances. At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars, the Space Station would be
the most expensive object ever built. The whole world watched as a Russian rocket launched 
the first module of the ISS into the sky. Zarya, meaning sunrise, 
was equipped with two solar panels and a propulsion system 
that had the important task of keeping the young station 
from crashing into the Earth by staying a safe 400 kilometers away. The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour
followed two weeks later carrying Unity, a node module to which
other modules could be connected, and an international 
six-person assembly crew. Then came Zvezda, which brought
communications and living accommodations. Ever since the International 
Space Station's first tenants arrived, it's been continually occupied with more than 200 visitors spending 
an average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti 
holds the record for the longest single space flight
by a woman at 199 days on the ISS. 2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,
the first of four research modules, where astronauts spend
approximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments
in microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off 
muscle atrophy, station maintenance and repair, and connecting with family 
or awe-inspired minds around the world. But they still find time for fun,
with regular movie nights and even shooting 
the first music video in space. Destiny also controls the seven-jointed
robotic Canadarm2. Capable of moving 
more than 100,000 kilograms, it's perfect for unloading 
new arrivals from shuttles. 2001 was a busy year for the Space Station
with the addition of Quest, the main airlock for strolls outside, and Pirs, a pier for Russian 
spacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready 
emergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering 
research modules to the ISS, the space shuttle
Columbia exploded during reentry tragically killing 
the seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly
picked up pace with the addition of more hubs, 
airlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning
360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included 
platforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated
by the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough
to power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International 
Space Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space 
Shuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve
as an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people 
began a one-year stay on the ISS, allowing scientists to study the long-term
physical and psychological effects of being in space, which would prove useful for increasingly
ambitious space travel, like trips to Mars. Over its lifetime, we've learned 
an immense amount scientifically, but also about 
our capacity to work together and accomplish truly remarkable acts.

approximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments
in microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off

spacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready 
emergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering 
research modules to the ISS, the space shuttle
Columbia exploded during reentry tragically killing 
the seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly
picked up pace with the addition of more hubs, 
airlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning
360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included 
platforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated
by the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough
to power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International 
Space Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space 
Shuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve
as an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people

Have you ever been gazing at a starry sky when suddenly 
a bright dot glided into view? If it wasn't blinking, then you've had
the distinct pleasure of seeing one of mankind's greatest 
collaborative feats with your own eyes: The International Space Station. Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,
and weighing more than 320 cars, the International Space Station 
is so large that no single rocket could have 
lifted it into orbit. Instead, it was assembled piece by piece while hurtling through space
at 28,000 kilometers per hour, lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes. It all started when sixteen nations signed the Space Station 
Intergovernmental Agreement, laying out each partner's 
expected contributions to the ISS, from modules and maintenance
to sharing information and finances. At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars, the Space Station would be
the most expensive object ever built. The whole world watched as a Russian rocket launched 
the first module of the ISS into the sky. Zarya, meaning sunrise, 
was equipped with two solar panels and a propulsion system 
that had the important task of keeping the young station 
from crashing into the Earth by staying a safe 400 kilometers away. The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour
followed two weeks later carrying Unity, a node module to which
other modules could be connected, and an international 
six-person assembly crew. Then came Zvezda, which brought
communications and living accommodations. Ever since the International 
Space Station's first tenants arrived, it's been continually occupied with more than 200 visitors spending 
an average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
An estimated 20 million cases of blindness
worldwide are caused by cataracts, a curable condition affecting the lens
that focuses images onto the eye's retina. A cataract occurs when proteins 
in the lens lose their normal arrangement, clumping together in a way that causes
discoloration or clouding, and eventually blocks most vision. Cataracts can be caused by eye injury, certain medications, ultraviolet radiation, diabetes, smoking, or some genetic disorders. But the most common cause is aging. In the United States, more than 50%
of people over the age of 80 develop them. Cataracts were treated 
over 2,500 years ago in India, though similar procedures 
may have existed even earlier in Ancient Egypt and Babylon. The most common procedure,
called couching, involved pressing 
a sharp instrument into the eye to loosen and push 
the clouded lens out of the way. Although this could increase 
the amount of light entering the eye, the lack of a lens would leave 
the patient's vision out of focus. Despite its low success rate,
and high risk of infection or injury, couching is still performed 
in some parts of the world. Later procedures would also focus
on removing the cloudy lens, for example, by making an opening
in the cornea to pull out the lens along with the membrane capsule 
surrounding it. While the invention of eyeglasses
allowed for some restoration of focus, they had to be extremely thick to help. Furthermore, such techniques
still caused complications, like damaging the retina, or leaving the eye 
with uncomfortable stitches. But in the 20th century, 
something unexpected happened. Eye surgeon Sir Harold Ridley was treating
World War II casualties when he noticed that acrylic plastic from
a shattered aircraft cockpit had become lodged in a pilot's eyes
without triggering an adverse reaction. This led him to propose surgically
implanting artificial lenses into the eye to replace cataracts. And despite initial resistance, the method became standard practice
by the 1980s. Since Ridley's discovery, the intraocular lens 
has undergone several improvements. Modern lenses can fit 
into the membrane capsule that the cataract is extracted from, leaving more of 
the eye's natural anatomy intact. And the ability to fine-tune 
the lens curvature allows the surgery to restore 
a patient's normal vision without the need for glasses. Of course, surgical techniques 
have also progressed. Microscopic procedures use 
small instruments or lasers to make precise incisions of one 
or two millimeters in the cornea, while an ultrasound probe breaks up
and removes the cataracted lens with minimal trauma to the eye. Low-tech versions of this operation have
made the surgery quick and inexpensive, helping it spread 
across the developing world. Places like Aravind Eye Hospital in India have pioneered high-volume, 
low-cost cataract surgery for as little as six dollars. Why then, with all these advances, are there still so many 
blind people in the world? The main issue is access to health care, with poor infrastructure 
and a shortage of doctors being a major barrier in many regions. But this is not the only problem. In many rural areas with poor education, blindness is often accepted 
as an inevitable part of aging, for which someone 
might not think to seek treatment. This is why information is crucial. Increased community awareness programs
and the spread of mobile phones mean that many of those who might have remained blind for
the rest of their lives due to cataracts are now reachable. And for them, 
a brighter future is in sight.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How many people in the world are estimated to be blind from cataracts?

**Transcript**:
An estimated 20 million cases of blindness
worldwide are caused by cataracts, a curable condition affecting the lens
that focuses images onto the eye's retina. A cataract occurs when proteins 
in the lens lose their normal arrangement, clumping together in a way that causes
discoloration or clouding, and eventually blocks most vision. Cataracts can be caused by eye injury, certain medications, ultraviolet radiation, diabetes, smoking, or some genetic disorders. But the most common cause is aging. In the United States, more than 50%
of people over the age of 80 develop them. Cataracts were treated 
over 2,500 years ago in India, though similar procedures 
may have existed even earlier in Ancient Egypt and Babylon. The most common procedure,
called couching, involved pressing 
a sharp instrument into the eye to loosen and push 
the clouded lens out of the way. Although this could increase 
the amount of light entering the eye, the lack of a lens would leave 
the patient's vision out of focus. Despite its low success rate,
and high risk of infection or injury, couching is still performed 
in some parts of the world. Later procedures would also focus
on removing the cloudy lens, for example, by making an opening
in the cornea to pull out the lens along with the membrane capsule 
surrounding it. While the invention of eyeglasses
allowed for some restoration of focus, they had to be extremely thick to help. Furthermore, such techniques
still caused complications, like damaging the retina, or leaving the eye 
with uncomfortable stitches. But in the 20th century, 
something unexpected happened. Eye surgeon Sir Harold Ridley was treating
World War II casualties when he noticed that acrylic plastic from
a shattered aircraft cockpit had become lodged in a pilot's eyes
without triggering an adverse reaction. This led him to propose surgically
implanting artificial lenses into the eye to replace cataracts. And despite initial resistance, the method became standard practice
by the 1980s. Since Ridley's discovery, the intraocular lens 
has undergone several improvements. Modern lenses can fit 
into the membrane capsule that the cataract is extracted from, leaving more of 
the eye's natural anatomy intact. And the ability to fine-tune 
the lens curvature allows the surgery to restore 
a patient's normal vision without the need for glasses. Of course, surgical techniques 
have also progressed. Microscopic procedures use 
small instruments or lasers to make precise incisions of one 
or two millimeters in the cornea, while an ultrasound probe breaks up
and removes the cataracted lens with minimal trauma to the eye. Low-tech versions of this operation have
made the surgery quick and inexpensive, helping it spread 
across the developing world. Places like Aravind Eye Hospital in India have pioneered high-volume, 
low-cost cataract surgery for as little as six dollars. Why then, with all these advances, are there still so many 
blind people in the world? The main issue is access to health care, with poor infrastructure 
and a shortage of doctors being a major barrier in many regions. But this is not the only problem. In many rural areas with poor education, blindness is often accepted 
as an inevitable part of aging, for which someone 
might not think to seek treatment. This is why information is crucial. Increased community awareness programs
and the spread of mobile phones mean that many of those who might have remained blind for
the rest of their lives due to cataracts are now reachable. And for them, 
a brighter future is in sight.

**Transcript**:
Think back to a really vivid memory. Got it? Okay, now try to remember what 
you had for lunch three weeks ago. That second memory 
probably isn't as strong, but why not? Why do we remember some things,
and not others? And why do memories eventually fade? Let's look at how memories form
in the first place. When you experience something,
like dialing a phone number, the experience is converted 
into a pulse of electrical energy that zips along a network of neurons. Information first lands 
in short term memory, where it's available 
from anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's then transferred to long-term memory
through areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage regions
across the brain. Neurons throughout the brain
communicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. If two neurons communicate repeatedly,
a remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication 
between them increases. This process, 
called long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism
by which memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost? Age is one factor. As we get older, 
synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily 
we can retrieve memories. Scientists have several theories about
what's behind this deterioration, from actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus 
loses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total loss of 20% by the time 
you're 80 years old to the drop in the production 
of neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine,
which is vital to learning and memory. These changes seem to affect how people
retrieve stored information. Age also affects 
our memory-making abilities. Memories are encoded most strongly
when we're paying attention, when we're deeply engaged,
and when information is meaningful to us. Mental and physical health problems,
which tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability 
to pay attention, and thus act as memory thieves. Another leading cause of memory problems
is chronic stress. When we're constantly overloaded with work
and personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert. This response has evolved from
the physiological mechanism designed to make sure 
we can survive in a crisis. Stress chemicals help mobilize energy
and increase alertness. However, with chronic stress our bodies
become flooded with these chemicals, resulting in a loss of brain cells
and an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability 
to retain new information. Depression is another culprit. People who are depressed are 40%
more likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals 
less attentive to new information. Dwelling on sad events in the past,
another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay 
attention to the present, affecting the ability to store
short-term memories. Isolation, which is tied to depression,
is another memory thief. A study by the Harvard School 
of Public Health found that older people 
with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline

**Transcript**:
Think back to a really vivid memory. Got it? Okay, now try to remember what 
you had for lunch three weeks ago. That second memory 
probably isn't as strong, but why not? Why do we remember some things,
and not others? And why do memories eventually fade? Let's look at how memories form
in the first place. When you experience something,
like dialing a phone number, the experience is converted 
into a pulse of electrical energy that zips along a network of neurons. Information first lands 
in short term memory, where it's available 
from anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's then transferred to long-term memory
through areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage regions
across the brain. Neurons throughout the brain
communicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. If two neurons communicate repeatedly,
a remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication 
between them increases. This process, 
called long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism
by which memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost? Age is one factor. As we get older, 
synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily 
we can retrieve memories. Scientists have several theories about
what's behind this deterioration, from actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus 
loses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total loss of 20% by the time 
you're 80 years old to the drop in the production 
of neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine,
which is vital to learning and memory. These changes seem to affect how people
retrieve stored information. Age also affects 
our memory-making abilities. Memories are encoded most strongly
when we're paying attention, when we're deeply engaged,
and when information is meaningful to us. Mental and physical health problems,
which tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability 
to pay attention, and thus act as memory thieves. Another leading cause of memory problems
is chronic stress. When we're constantly overloaded with work
and personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert. This response has evolved from
the physiological mechanism designed to make sure 
we can survive in a crisis. Stress chemicals help mobilize energy
and increase alertness. However, with chronic stress our bodies
become flooded with these chemicals, resulting in a loss of brain cells
and an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability 
to retain new information. Depression is another culprit. People who are depressed are 40%
more likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals 
less attentive to new information. Dwelling on sad events in the past,
another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay 
attention to the present, affecting the ability to store
short-term memories. Isolation, which is tied to depression,
is another memory thief. A study by the Harvard School 
of Public Health found that older people 
with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline
over a six-year period. The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction 
gives our brain a mental workout. Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain
or risk losing it. But don't despair. There are several steps you can take to aid your brain

**Transcript**:
Vatican City: capitol of the Catholic Church,
home to the pope, owner of impressive collections of art and history all contained within the
borders of the world's smallest country: conveniently circumnavigateable on foot in only 40 minutes. Just how did the world end up with this tiny
nation? The short answer is: because Mussolini and
the long answer is fiendishly complicated so here's a simplified medium version: The popes used to rule a country called the
Papal States that covered much of modern day Italy. It was during this 1,000+ year reign that
the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica the largest church in the world -- and also
built a wall around the base of a hill known as Vatican upon which St. Peter's Stood. But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought
Rome would be an awesome capital for their country and so conquered the Papal States. His nation destroyed the Pope hid behind the
walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed,
while simultaneously complaining about being a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy -- which
according to him didn't exist. Rather than risk religious civil war by getting
rid of the pope the Kingdom of Italy decided to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give
up -- but religion is nothing if not obstinate -- and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 popes and sixty years
later nothing had changed. Which brings us to Benito Mussolini the then
prime minister of Italy who was tired of listing to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics
about his self-imposed imprisonment so Mussolini thought he could score some political points
by striking a deal which looked like this: 1) Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope. and… 2) Italy gave the Pope a bunch of apology
money In return 1) The Pope acknowledged that Italy existed
and and… 2) The Pope promised to remain neutral in
politics and wars. On the off chance that, you know, Mussolini
thought this might be a thing. The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican
City was born. And today the tiny nation on a hill has all
the things you'd expect of a country: its own government that makes its own laws that
are enforced by its own police, who put people who break them in its own jail. It also has its own bank and prints its own
stamps and issues its own license plates, though only its citizens can drive within
its borders presumably because of terrible, terrible parking -- and as the true mark of
any self-respecting nation: it has its own top-level domain: .VA But, despite all these national trappings
Vatican City is not really like any other country. Hold on to your fancy hat, because it's about
to get weird: To understand the Vatican: there are two people
and two things that you need to know about: the famous pope, the incredibly confusing
Holy See, The Country of Vatican City and along with that the almost completely unknown
King of Vatican City. But first the Pope: who gets a throne to sit
upon and from which he acts as the Bishop for all the Catholics in Rome. Actually all Bishops in the Catholic Church
get their own thrones but because the Bishop of Rome is also the Pope his thrown is special
and has it's own special name: The Holy See. Every time a Pope dies or retires there is
a sort of game of thrones to see which of the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy
See. So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal. As such the name The Holy See not only refers
to the throne but also all the rules that make the Catholic Church the Catholic Church. When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned
deal, technically he gave the land of Vatican City to The Holy See -- which, believe it
or not, is a legal corporate person in international law. Basically every time you hear the words The
Holy See think Catholic Church, Inc of which the Pope is the CEO. Now back to the King. The King of Vatican City has absolute, unchecked
power within the country's borders and his presence makes Vatican City one of only six
remanning absolute monarchies in the world, including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
and Swaziland. The King's absolute power is why Vatican City
can't join the European Union because only democracies are allowed. Through Vatican City does, strictly speaking,
have a legislative brach of government -- staffed by cardinals, appointed by the pope -- the
King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions and at any time for any reason. So why do you never hear about the King of
Vatican City? Because though King and Pope are two different
roles, they just happen to be occupied by the same person at the same time -- which
has the funny consequence that, because the Pope is elected and the King is all-powerful
but they're the same guy it makes Vatican City the world's only elected, non-hereditary
absolute monarchy. It's this dual-role that makes untangling
Vatican City so difficult because the Pope, depending on the situation either acts as
The King of the country of Vatican City or the Pope of the Holy See. Got it? No? OK, here's an analogy: Imagine if a powerful international company,
say Grey Industries, had a CEO who convinced the United States to give one of its islands
to the Company which then made the island into a new country -- Greytropolis -- with
an absolute monarchy as its government and the law that the King of Greytropolis is,
by definition, the CEO of Grey Industries. It's pretty obvious at that point that the
CEO should move his corporate headquarters to the new nation -- so that the laws of the
country can benefit the company and the company's global reach can benefit the country. As for the man in the middle sometimes it's
good to the the CEO and sometimes it's good to be the king. That is essentially Vatican City. But if you're still confused, don't worry
even other countries can't keep it straight. For example the United Nations has The Holy
See the corporation as a member but not Vatican City the actual country. And The Holy See gives passports to Vatican
City citizens that other countries accept even though those passports come from a company,
not a country. And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they
are perhaps the strangest consequence of the Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch. While other countries mint new citizens with
the ever popular process of human reproduction Vatican City does not. No one in Vatican City is born a citizen -- and
that's not just because, within a rounding error, there are no female Vaticans. The only way to become a citizen is for the
King of Vatican City to appoint you as one. And the King only appoints you a citizen if
you work for the Pope -- who is also the King. And because the King is all-powerful your
citizenship is at his whim. If you quit your job for the Pope, the King
-- who is also the pope -- will revoke your citizenship. These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't
have a real permanent population to speak of: there are only about 500 full citizens
-- which is fewer people that live in single skyscrapers in many countries -- and all these
citizens work for The Holy See as either Cardinals or Diplomats or the Pope's bodyguards or other
Catholic-related jobs. So it's best to think of Vatican City as a
kind of Sovereign Corporate Headquarters that grants temporary citizenship to its managers
rather than a real city-state like Singapore: which has a self-reproducing population of
citizens engaged in a variety of economic activities both of which Vatican City lacks. But in the end, the reason the world cares
about Vatican City is not because of the citizens within its walls but because of the billion
members of its church outside those walls.

**Transcript**:
The constant thud underneath your feet, the constrained space, and the monotony of going nowhere fast. It feels like hours have gone by,
but it's only been eleven minutes, and you wonder, "Why am I torturing myself? This thing has got to be considered 
a cruel and unusual punishment." Actually, that's exactly 
what it is, or was. You see, in the 1800s, treadmills were created 
to punish English prisoners. At the time, the English prison system
was abysmally bad. Execution and deportation
were often the punishments of choice, and those who were locked away
faced hours of solitude in filthy cells. So social movements led by
religious groups, philanthropies, and celebrities, like Charles Dickens, sought to change these dire conditions
and help reform the prisoners. When their movement succeeded, entire prisons were remodeled
and new forms of rehabilitation, such as the treadmill,
were introduced. Here's how the original version, invented in 1818 by English engineer 
Sir William Cubitt, worked. Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes
of a large paddle wheel. As the wheel turned, the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off, similar to modern stepper machines. Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water, crush grain, or power mills, which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated. These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape, and that added benefit of powering mills helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars. It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners. It's estimated that, on average, prisoners spent six 
or so hours a day on treadmills, the equivalent of climbing
5,000 to 14,000 feet. 14,000 feet is roughly 
Mount Everest's halfway point. Imagine doing that five days a week
with little food. Cubitt's idea quickly spread
across the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its creation, over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill, and America, a similar amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries, not that prison guards seemed to care. In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror," a quote many still agree with. And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century, when they were banned for being
excessively cruel under the Prison's Act of 1898. But of course the torture device
returned with a vengeance, this time targeting 
the unsuspecting public. In 1911, a treadmill patent 
was registered in the U.S., and by 1952, the forerunner for 
today's modern treadmill had been created. When the jogging craze 
hit the U.S. in the 1970s, the treadmill was thrust 
back into the limelight as an easy and convenient 
way to improve aerobic fitness, and lose unwanted pounds, which, to be fair, 
it's pretty good at doing. And the machine 
has maintained its popularity since. So the next time you voluntarily subject
yourself to what was once a cruel and unusual punishment, just be glad you can control
when you'll hop off.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The constant thud underneath your feet, the constrained space, and the monotony of going nowhere fast. It feels like hours have gone by,
but it's only been eleven minutes, and you wonder, "Why am I torturing myself? This thing has got to be considered 
a cruel and unusual punishment." Actually, that's exactly 
what it is, or was. You see, in the 1800s, treadmills were created 
to punish English prisoners. At the time, the English prison system
was abysmally bad. Execution and deportation
were often the punishments of choice, and those who were locked away
faced hours of solitude in filthy cells. So social movements led by
religious groups, philanthropies, and celebrities, like Charles Dickens, sought to change these dire conditions
and help reform the prisoners. When their movement succeeded, entire prisons were remodeled
and new forms of rehabilitation, such as the treadmill,
were introduced. Here's how the original version, invented in 1818 by English engineer 
Sir William Cubitt, worked. Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes
of a large paddle wheel. As the wheel turned, the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off, similar to modern stepper machines. Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water, crush grain, or power mills, which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated. These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape, and that added benefit of powering mills helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars. It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners. It's estimated that, on average, prisoners spent six 
or so hours a day on treadmills, the equivalent of climbing
5,000 to 14,000 feet. 14,000 feet is roughly 
Mount Everest's halfway point. Imagine doing that five days a week
with little food. Cubitt's idea quickly spread
across the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its creation, over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill, and America, a similar amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries, not that prison guards seemed to care. In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror," a quote many still agree with. And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century, when they were banned for being
excessively cruel under the Prison's Act of 1898. But of course the torture device
returned with a vengeance, this time targeting 
the unsuspecting public. In 1911, a treadmill patent 
was registered in the U.S., and by 1952, the forerunner for 
today's modern treadmill had been created. When the jogging craze 
hit the U.S. in the 1970s, the treadmill was thrust 
back into the limelight as an easy and convenient 
way to improve aerobic fitness, and lose unwanted pounds, which, to be fair, 
it's pretty good at doing. And the machine 
has maintained its popularity since. So the next time you voluntarily subject
yourself to what was once a cruel and unusual punishment, just be glad you can control
when you'll hop off.

**Transcript**:
The DNA in just one of your cells gets damaged tens of thousands 
of times per day. Multiply that by your body's
hundred trillion or so cells, and you've got a quintillion 
DNA errors everyday. And because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins 
your cells need to function, damage causes serious problems,
such as cancer. The errors come in different forms. Sometimes nucleotides, 
DNA's building blocks, get damaged, other times nucleotides 
get matched up incorrectly, causing mutations, and nicks in one or both strands
can interfere with DNA replication, or even cause sections 
of DNA to get mixed up. Fortunately, your cells have ways
of fixing most of these problems most of the time. These repair pathways 
all rely on specialized enzymes. Different ones respond 
to different types of damage. One common error is base mismatches. Each nucleotide contains a base, and during DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase
is supposed to bring in the right partner to pair with every base 
on each template strand. Adenine with thymine,
and guanine with cytosine. But about once every 
hundred thousand additions, it makes a mistake. The enzyme catches 
most of these right away, and cuts off a few nucleotides
and replaces them with the correct ones. And just in case it missed a few, a second set of proteins 
comes behind it to check. If they find a mismatch, they cut out the incorrect nucleotide
and replace it. This is called mismatch repair. Together, these two systems reduce
the number of base mismatch errors to about one in one billion. But DNA can get damaged
after replication, too. Lots of different molecules
can cause chemical changes to nucleotides. Some of these come 
from environmental exposure, like certain compounds in tobacco smoke. But others are molecules that are found
in cells naturally, like hydrogen peroxide. Certain chemical changes are so common that they have specific enzymes assigned
to reverse the damage. But the cell also has more general
repair pathways. If just one base is damaged, it can usually be fixed by a process
called base excision repair. One enzyme snips out the damaged base, and other enzymes come in to trim around
the site and replace the nucleotides. UV light can cause damage 
that's a little harder to fix. Sometimes, it causes two adjacent
nucleotides to stick together, distorting the DNA's double helix shape. Damage like this requires 
a more complex process called nucleotide excision repair. A team of proteins removes a long strand
of 24 or so nucleotides, and replaces them with fresh ones. Very high frequency radiation,
like gamma rays and x-rays, cause a different kind of damage. They can actually sever one 
or both strands of the DNA backbone. Double strand breaks
are the most dangerous. Even one can cause cell death. The two most common pathways
for repairing double strand breaks are called homologous recombination
and non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination uses an undamaged
section of similar DNA as a template. Enzymes interlace the damaged
and undamgaed strands, get them to exchange sequences
of nucleotides, and finally fill in the missing gaps to end up with two complete
double-stranded segments. Non-homologous end joining,
on the other hand, doesn't rely on a template. Instead, a series of proteins
trims off a few nucleotides and then fuses the broken ends 
back together. This process isn't as accurate. It can cause genes to get mixed up,
or moved around. But it's useful when 
sister DNA isn't available. Of course, changes to DNA 
aren't always bad. Beneficial mutations 
can allow a species to evolve. But most of the time, 
we want DNA to stay the same. Defects in DNA repair are associated
with premature aging and many kinds of cancer. So if you're looking for 
a fountain of youth, it's already operating in your cells, billions and billions of times a day.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 19, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 8
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The DNA in just one of your cells gets damaged tens of thousands 
of times per day. Multiply that by your body's
hundred trillion or so cells, and you've got a quintillion 
DNA errors everyday. And because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins 
your cells need to function, damage causes serious problems,
such as cancer. The errors come in different forms. Sometimes nucleotides, 
DNA's building blocks, get damaged, other times nucleotides 
get matched up incorrectly, causing mutations, and nicks in one or both strands
can interfere with DNA replication, or even cause sections 
of DNA to get mixed up. Fortunately, your cells have ways
of fixing most of these problems most of the time. These repair pathways 
all rely on specialized enzymes. Different ones respond 
to different types of damage. One common error is base mismatches. Each nucleotide contains a base, and during DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase
is supposed to bring in the right partner to pair with every base 
on each template strand. Adenine with thymine,
and guanine with cytosine. But about once every 
hundred thousand additions, it makes a mistake. The enzyme catches 
most of these right away, and cuts off a few nucleotides
and replaces them with the correct ones. And just in case it missed a few, a second set of proteins 
comes behind it to check. If they find a mismatch, they cut out the incorrect nucleotide
and replace it. This is called mismatch repair. Together, these two systems reduce
the number of base mismatch errors to about one in one billion. But DNA can get damaged
after replication, too. Lots of different molecules
can cause chemical changes to nucleotides. Some of these come 
from environmental exposure, like certain compounds in tobacco smoke. But others are molecules that are found
in cells naturally, like hydrogen peroxide. Certain chemical changes are so common that they have specific enzymes assigned
to reverse the damage. But the cell also has more general
repair pathways. If just one base is damaged, it can usually be fixed by a process
called base excision repair. One enzyme snips out the damaged base, and other enzymes come in to trim around
the site and replace the nucleotides. UV light can cause damage 
that's a little harder to fix. Sometimes, it causes two adjacent
nucleotides to stick together, distorting the DNA's double helix shape. Damage like this requires 
a more complex process called nucleotide excision repair. A team of proteins removes a long strand
of 24 or so nucleotides, and replaces them with fresh ones. Very high frequency radiation,
like gamma rays and x-rays, cause a different kind of damage. They can actually sever one 
or both strands of the DNA backbone. Double strand breaks
are the most dangerous. Even one can cause cell death. The two most common pathways
for repairing double strand breaks are called homologous recombination
and non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination uses an undamaged
section of similar DNA as a template. Enzymes interlace the damaged
and undamgaed strands, get them to exchange sequences
of nucleotides, and finally fill in the missing gaps to end up with two complete
double-stranded segments. Non-homologous end joining,
on the other hand, doesn't rely on a template. Instead, a series of proteins
trims off a few nucleotides and then fuses the broken ends 
back together. This process isn't as accurate. It can cause genes to get mixed up,
or moved around. But it's useful when 
sister DNA isn't available. Of course, changes to DNA 
aren't always bad. Beneficial mutations 
can allow a species to evolve. But most of the time, 
we want DNA to stay the same. Defects in DNA repair are associated
with premature aging and many kinds of cancer. So if you're looking for 
a fountain of youth, it's already operating in your cells, billions and billions of times a day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Options: A. Cell needs a similar copy of damaged DNA, B. Broken ends are fused together, C. Base excision repair takes place, D. The cell must duplicate

no parole sentence. Hello. [♪ music ♪] Having served 14 years
boosts his credibility— boosts his credibility
with inmates. How's your week been?
- It's good. [Maull] Yeah? Good.
What's up? Yeah.
Hey. Welcome. When I got locked up,
I really hit a wall
of just seeing the craziness
of my life path up until then
and the incredible
selfish decisions
I'd been making. My son was 9 years old.
He was going
to grow up without his dad. And I was just so deeply
full of remorse and regret that I just literally
started practicing meditation
like my hair was on fire. So I became extremely
motivated to turn
my life around. [♪ music ♪] And so I was living
the life of this prison monk. [♪ music ♪] I was sourcing
a meditation group
twice a week in the chapel. [♪ music ♪] I started receiving letters
from prisoners
while I was in prison. I had published some articles;
people knew about me
out in the world a little bit, and they started
sending some of these letters
to me thinking I would know
what to do with them. I worked in
the education department,
and I had access
to a copy machine. I would copy articles
out of books,
and I'd put together
a little thing and I'd send it off
to a prisoner. So it started off that way,
and I decided it was
a much bigger deal than I could do
from my prison cells. I think we have
a co-creative relationship
with our life. We can't control other people,
we don't control life, but is there some relationship
between what we put out
and what comes back? Freedom before I came here
was just another word. I had never been
to prison before. All you know is what the media
and the movies
say about prison— "Take care of yourself, man." "Somebody's going to try
to take your manhood
or something."
You know what I mean? I'm thinking I'm going
to come in here
and fight the world. [Maull] In a prison like Moran,
there's a serious conflict
waiting around any corner. It's an environment
where people's worst behaviors
are just right there just under the surface. [♪ music ♪] When I first came in,
I fought with officers,
would beat up anyone, would do the unthinkable
just because. [Dennis] It's a vicious cycle
because once you come to prison your life just keeps tumbling,
tumbling, tumbling, and it's like
a never-ending wall
that won't stop building unless you find some way
to get over that wall
or at least in front of it. [Richman] What circumstances
did they have
to survive on the street to bring them
to where they are now? Do we want to save those lives,
or do we want to discard them? The crimes I committed,
I brought shame
to not only myself
but to those who I love. So I'm just really trying
to do something
to get out of that cycle. Somebody's given us
an opportunity just
to meditate
and connect ourselves, and that's golden. So sit up with
that good posture,
just rest your hands
on your legs, and just take
a moment to just feel. [♪ music ♪] [Richman] I've always
thought that the people
who survive are so much stronger
than I could ever be. I asked Fleet how he survived
and thrived the way he has. He credits meditation
for having given him
the strength to live
his life in prison and come out not as much
the worse for wear
as most people do. I don't have a release date. So I can only go home
when they decide I can. So I learned to live
day by day,
and that helped me
to deal with prison, and I could only
do that being in the moment,
being in the now. [♪ music ♪] It's like if I don't like
what's going on,
what can I do to shift it? If I don't like
the relationship I have
with my boss or with one
of the COs or something, could I approach
that person
in a different way? Can I get creative
about what I'm doing
to bring about a shift
in the way things are— in other words,
owning my own situation. So how do you resolve that? I take a breath and then
[chuckles] I step back.
Really, you have to. [Maull] Then suddenly
get that there's
this whole thing there that they thought
was who they are. That's the only
reality they knew. Suddenly they get to step
outside of that a little bit. You just see the lights go on. It's like
this sudden illumination.
It's like
a mini enlightenment of sorts. And that's very powerful.
That's what keeps me coming. The reality of it
is I'm living life, and meditation
it has brought
a new perspective in the way that it gave me
like a tool
to really look inside myself and change the way I am. [Richman] People don't
understand the value
of what they call
the soft stuff, and I sometimes think
without the soft stuff,
no matter how much
hard stuff you have, you're bound to fail. You can live your life.
You can be yourself. You can show others
that this isn't a place
to breed a better criminal; this could actually
be a place to breed
a better person. You're here
because the way that you were
didn't work. So why not be better? [prisoners chattering] [Richman] The people
in prison are us. They're not monsters. And more importantly,
whether we want them to or not, they're getting out. So do you want them
to come out angrier
and meaner and more dangerous than they were
when they came in, or do you want
to do whatever you can
to change their behavior
while they're here? We need people to see
and experience prisoners
stepping out of that culture and doing something
transformative with their lives, and then people
will start to have faith, people will see people
coming back to their community and they realize these
are human beings
and that human beings'
lives have value and they're not expendable. [♪ music ♪] [This year 700,000 people

from my prison cells. I think we have
a co-creative relationship
with our life. We can't control other people,
we don't control life, but is there some relationship
between what we put out
and what comes back? Freedom before I came here
was just another word. I had never been
to prison before. All you know is what the media
and the movies
say about prison— "Take care of yourself, man." "Somebody's going to try
to take your manhood
or something."
You know what I mean? I'm thinking I'm going
to come in here
and fight the world. [Maull] In a prison like Moran,
there's a serious conflict
waiting around any corner. It's an environment
where people's worst behaviors
are just right there just under the surface. [♪ music ♪] When I first came in,
I fought with officers,
would beat up anyone, would do the unthinkable
just because. [Dennis] It's a vicious cycle
because once you come to prison your life just keeps tumbling,
tumbling, tumbling, and it's like
a never-ending wall
that won't stop building unless you find some way
to get over that wall
or at least in front of it. [Richman] What circumstances
did they have
to survive on the street to bring them
to where they are now? Do we want to save those lives,
or do we want to discard them? The crimes I committed,
I brought shame
to not only myself
but to those who I love. So I'm just really trying
to do something
to get out of that cycle. Somebody's given us
an opportunity just
to meditate
and connect ourselves, and that's golden. So sit up with
that good posture,
just rest your hands
on your legs, and just take
a moment to just feel. [♪ music ♪] [Richman] I've always
thought that the people
who survive are so much stronger
than I could ever be. I asked Fleet how he survived
and thrived the way he has. He credits meditation
for having given him
the strength to live
his life in prison and come out not as much
the worse for wear
as most people do. I don't have a release date. So I can only go home
when they decide I can. So I learned to live
day by day,
and that helped me
to deal with prison, and I could only
do that being in the moment,
being in the now. [♪ music ♪] It's like if I don't like
what's going on,
what can I do to shift it? If I don't like
the relationship I have

in a different way? Can I get creative
about what I'm doing
to bring about a shift
in the way things are— in other words,
owning my own situation. So how do you resolve that? I take a breath and then
[chuckles] I step back.
Really, you have to. [Maull] Then suddenly
get that there's
this whole thing there that they thought
was who they are. That's the only
reality they knew. Suddenly they get to step
outside of that a little bit. You just see the lights go on. It's like
this sudden illumination.
It's like
a mini enlightenment of sorts. And that's very powerful.
That's what keeps me coming. The reality of it

it has brought
a new perspective in the way that it gave me
like a tool
to really look inside myself and change the way I am. [Richman] People don't
understand the value
of what they call
the soft stuff, and I sometimes think
without the soft stuff,
no matter how much
hard stuff you have, you're bound to fail. You can live your life.
You can be yourself. You can show others
that this isn't a place
to breed a better criminal; this could actually
be a place to breed
a better person. You're here
because the way that you were
didn't work. So why not be better? [prisoners chattering] [Richman] The people
in prison are us. They're not monsters. And more importantly,
whether we want them to or not, they're getting out. So do you want them
to come out angrier
and meaner and more dangerous than they were
when they came in, or do you want
to do whatever you can
to change their behavior
while they're here? We need people to see
and experience prisoners
stepping out of that culture and doing something
transformative with their lives, and then people
will start to have faith, people will see people
coming back to their community and they realize these

Hey. Welcome. When I got locked up,
I really hit a wall
of just seeing the craziness
of my life path up until then
and the incredible
selfish decisions
I'd been making. My son was 9 years old.
He was going
to grow up without his dad. And I was just so deeply
full of remorse and regret that I just literally
started practicing meditation
like my hair was on fire. So I became extremely
motivated to turn
my life around. [♪ music ♪] And so I was living
the life of this prison monk. [♪ music ♪] I was sourcing
a meditation group
twice a week in the chapel. [♪ music ♪] I started receiving letters
from prisoners
while I was in prison. I had published some articles;
people knew about me
out in the world a little bit, and they started
sending some of these letters
to me thinking I would know
what to do with them. I worked in
the education department,
and I had access
to a copy machine. I would copy articles
out of books,
and I'd put together
a little thing and I'd send it off
to a prisoner. So it started off that way,
and I decided it was
a much bigger deal than I could do
from my prison cells. I think we have
a co-creative relationship

**Transcript**:
This may look like a neatly arranged
stack of numbers, but it's actually
a mathematical treasure trove. Indian mathematicians called it 
the Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world,
it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair
since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so 
intrigued mathematicians the world over? In short, 
it's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern
that generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible
zeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs, 
and you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up 
with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle 
goes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called
the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients, 
or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row
of Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3,
which expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way
to look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up 
the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number
as part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is
(1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens
when you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561,
which is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting:
all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal
are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them 
into equilateral triangles. The next diagonal 
has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack
that many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this:
shade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much
when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal 
known as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just 
a mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes 
to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family 
of three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds 
to girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number 
corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number 
is what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum 
of all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly 
picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups 
of five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would
be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth 
element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly 
interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets
to this day. For example, mathematicians recently 
discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you.

to girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number 
corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number 
is what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum 
of all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly 
picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups 
of five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would
be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth 
element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly 
interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets
to this day. For example, mathematicians recently 
discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you.

**Transcript**:
This just in: "Thief robs town 
with world's largest chocolate bunny." Wait, so are we talking about this, or this? That's a classic case 
of a misplaced modifier, a common grammatical mistake that can dramatically change 
the meaning of a sentence. And lest you think 
this is a bit far-fetched, confusing headlines like this
appear all the time. Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses that add information 
about other parts of a sentence, which is usually helpful. But when modifiers
aren't linked clearly enough to the words 
they're actually referring to, they can create unintentional ambiguity. That happens because the modifying words, in this case, 
"with world's largest chocolate bunny," modify the wrong thing,
the robber's actions instead of the town. To correct this particular sentence,
we simply rephrase to make it clearer what the modifying 
phrase is talking about. "Town with world's largest chocolate bunny
robbed by thief." Now, at least it's clear that the thief wasn't armed 
with a giant chocolate animal. Sometimes, modifying words, 
phrases, or clauses don't appear to be modifying 
anything at all. That's called a dangling modifier. "Having robbed the bank in record time, it was possible to make off 
with the town's chocolate rabbit as well." The modifying phrase in this sentence
seems unrelated to anything else, and so we're clueless about who the chocolate-loving criminal 
could possibly be. Giving the modifier something to modify
will solve the problem. Then there's another group
called the squinting modifiers because they're stuck between two things
and could feasibly refer to either. Often, these modifiers are adverbs,
like the one in this sentence: "Robbers who steal chocolate bunnies
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers." "Rapidly" is the modifier, here,
but what's not clear is whether it's referring 
to the speed of the chocolate thievery, or how quickly it alerts 
the furious onlookers. To clarify, we can either put the modifier
closer to its intended phrase, which works in some cases, or we can entirely reword the sentence
so that the modifier no longer squints, but clearly applies to only one part. "Chocolate bunny-thieving robbers
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers." Justice will eventually come 
to the chocolate thief, but in the meantime, our task is to avoid verbal ambiguity by making it clear which parts 
of the sentences modifiers belong to. That way, we can at least maintain
grammatical law and order.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main issue with the original sentence "Thief robs town with world's largest chocolate bunny"?

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 24, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 10
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This just in: "Thief robs town 
with world's largest chocolate bunny." Wait, so are we talking about this, or this? That's a classic case 
of a misplaced modifier, a common grammatical mistake that can dramatically change 
the meaning of a sentence. And lest you think 
this is a bit far-fetched, confusing headlines like this
appear all the time. Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses that add information 
about other parts of a sentence, which is usually helpful. But when modifiers
aren't linked clearly enough to the words 
they're actually referring to, they can create unintentional ambiguity. That happens because the modifying words, in this case, 
"with world's largest chocolate bunny," modify the wrong thing,
the robber's actions instead of the town. To correct this particular sentence,
we simply rephrase to make it clearer what the modifying 
phrase is talking about. "Town with world's largest chocolate bunny
robbed by thief." Now, at least it's clear that the thief wasn't armed 
with a giant chocolate animal. Sometimes, modifying words, 
phrases, or clauses don't appear to be modifying 
anything at all. That's called a dangling modifier. "Having robbed the bank in record time, it was possible to make off 
with the town's chocolate rabbit as well." The modifying phrase in this sentence
seems unrelated to anything else, and so we're clueless about who the chocolate-loving criminal 
could possibly be. Giving the modifier something to modify
will solve the problem. Then there's another group
called the squinting modifiers because they're stuck between two things
and could feasibly refer to either. Often, these modifiers are adverbs,
like the one in this sentence: "Robbers who steal chocolate bunnies
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers." "Rapidly" is the modifier, here,
but what's not clear is whether it's referring 
to the speed of the chocolate thievery, or how quickly it alerts 
the furious onlookers. To clarify, we can either put the modifier
closer to its intended phrase, which works in some cases, or we can entirely reword the sentence
so that the modifier no longer squints, but clearly applies to only one part. "Chocolate bunny-thieving robbers
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers." Justice will eventually come 
to the chocolate thief, but in the meantime, our task is to avoid verbal ambiguity by making it clear which parts 
of the sentences modifiers belong to. That way, we can at least maintain
grammatical law and order.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Modifiers are always wrong; there's no correct way to use them.
Options: A. True, B. False
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why is it important to link modifiers clearly to the words they modify?
Options: A. To create complex sentences, B. To avoid verbal ambiguity and ensure clear meaning, C. To use more punctuation, D. To change the sentence structure to passive voice
Correct Option: None

2. Evaluate each matched MCQ pair based on the following criteria:
   - **Relevance (0.0000 - 1.0000)**: Assess how closely the generated question aligns with the content and intent of the ground truth question.
   - **Correct Answer Matching (0.0000 - 1.0000)**: Check if the correct answer option in the generated question matches the ground truth answer.
   - **Distractor Plausibility (0.0000-1.0000)**: Evaluate the quality of the distractors (incorrect options) in the generated question.
   - **Clarity and Readability (0.0000-1.0000)**: Rate how clear and understandable the question and options are.
