**Transcript**:
In the celestial court of the Jade Emperor
lived seven princesses. Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess
had a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky
and spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye
could find a seam. But her craft was the same day after day,
and she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted 
the weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister 
from earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them
to fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe 
of the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim
in one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,
she dreamt about staying forever. Meanwhile, a lone cowherd
approached the riverbank. He came here often
to sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently 
to the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,
the cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,
his lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's
plight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s 
celestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain 
if she lost her ticket back to Heaven. As the cowherd approached,
the princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment 
as a substitute. And after gaining her trust, 
the pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see 
the world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had
fallen deeply in love. The weaver and the cowherd
built a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver 
taught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was 
blessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored
the family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned
to her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,
she decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver
swept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized
that barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth
was merely a day in Heaven. When her family learned of her new life,
they were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked 
a golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river
of stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also
remembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt
over his back and hurtled upwards. Above the clouds, each lover attempted
to wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them
only grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother
watched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver 
and the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies 
to cheer them on. Finally, their love moved
the Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive
her granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver
to meet her earthly family once a year. And so, in late summer, the magpies
form a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people
in East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these 
star-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion.

**Transcript**:
In the celestial court of the Jade Emperor
lived seven princesses. Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess
had a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky
and spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye
could find a seam. But her craft was the same day after day,
and she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted 
the weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister 
from earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them
to fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe 
of the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim
in one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,
she dreamt about staying forever. Meanwhile, a lone cowherd
approached the riverbank. He came here often
to sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently 
to the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,
the cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,
his lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's
plight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s 
celestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain 
if she lost her ticket back to Heaven. As the cowherd approached,
the princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment 
as a substitute. And after gaining her trust, 
the pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see 
the world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had
fallen deeply in love. The weaver and the cowherd
built a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver 
taught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was 
blessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored
the family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned
to her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,
she decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver
swept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized
that barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth
was merely a day in Heaven. When her family learned of her new life,
they were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked 
a golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river
of stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also
remembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt
over his back and hurtled upwards. Above the clouds, each lover attempted
to wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them
only grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother
watched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver 
and the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies 
to cheer them on. Finally, their love moved
the Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive
her granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver
to meet her earthly family once a year. And so, in late summer, the magpies
form a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people
in East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these 
star-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion.

**Transcript**:
As Numberland’s best detective,
you thought you’d seen it all. But the desiccated corpses 
of prominent natural numbers— whole numbers greater than 0— have been showing up all over the city
for the past week. All of Digitopolis is on lockdown
from sundown to sunrise, and it’s still not enough to stop
what can only be described as a vampiric feeding frenzy. The police are helpless, 
and have turned to you. You put the missing persons case 
you’ve been investigating on hold and study the evidence. Here’s what you know: most victims have been completely
drained of their life’s essence. Some have a thin line of slime
separating digits— some of which were drained 
and others spared. Which leads you to mystery one: what’s the significance 
of the slime-lines, and why are certain digits untouched? Pause here to figure it out yourself. 
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s start by looking 
for a pattern in the victims. Why have some been fully drained,
and some slimed? Well, the slime-lined are in their prime— which is to say they’re prime numbers,
divisible only by 1 and themselves. Not a single one of the unslimed numbers,
on the other hand, is. Furthermore, the drained parts of the 
slimed primes are not, themselves, prime. When 71 got slimed, 7 was prime,
but 1 was not. If 461 had been split into 4 and 61,
the right side would have been prime, but instead it was split further
into non-prime digits. And when 2099 got slimed, 
the attacker went with 20 and 99, and was able to drain both. So you have a big problem. There are infinite potential victims: all non-prime numbers, and all prime numbers that can 
be slime-lined to reveal at least one non-prime number. In fact, you can only think of a few
numbers that aren't vulnerable. First of all, the one digit primes: 
2, 3, 5, and 7. Then primes like 23, which could only be
split into 2 and 3, both prime. These numbers are familiar, but why? Aha! Your missing person’s case. Someone is kidnapping the numbers
that can’t be drained: we’ll call them the immune. If you can identify the four immune 
who remain, perhaps you can get to them first
and figure out what’s going on. Who are the immune?
Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are 4 one-digit immune:
2, 3, 5, and 7. All have already been kidnapped. But every digit in all of the immune
must be one of those four numbers; otherwise there would be 
a non-prime split possible. That means there are only these 16
candidates among the two-digit numbers. The ones that are prime must be immune. We can eliminate anything 
that ends in 2 or 5, as they’ll always be divisible by 2 and 5. This diagonal is also out,
as they’re divisible by 11. If the digits of a number add
up to a multiple of 3, it’s divisible by 3. So that eliminates 57 and 27,
leaving these numbers. Which, upon double-checking, are, 
in fact, immune. We now have a strong starting point
for searching three-digit numbers: any 2 consecutive digits must be 
on the list of the two-digit immune. Those all end in 3 and 7, so the only possibilities
are these 8 options: the two-digit immune with additional
3s or 7s on their ends. 3 can’t follow 3,
nor 7 follow 7. And once again, adding the digits 
reveals that 237 and 537 are divisible by 3. 737 is 67 times 11, 
so that leaves just 373, which is, in fact, prime,
and therefore immune. Could a four-digit number be immune? No, any consecutive three digits
would have to be immune, and there’s no immune three digit
number that starts with a 7. You rush out, 
but reach each home too late, until the only immune left is 373. You’re in the nick of time to scare
off her would-be kidnapper; not the vampire itself but a minion. 373 explains that she and the other immune
are the subjects of an ancient prophecy that designated them as vampire slayers. They’d sometimes gather and try 
to figure out what a vampire is, but no one had the slightest idea. They found the idea of slaying
things quite distasteful. You both trail her would-be kidnapper
back to a foreboding castle. There you release the other 
kidnapped numbers and confront the vampire himself. He’s powerless before the slayers, 
but ever the pacifists, they round him up, return the lifeforce 
to his victims, and send him packing. Numberland is safe... for now.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 3 has some similarities.

However, a closer examination reveals that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest.

**Index of the most similar generated MCQ:** 3

**Reasoning:** 
The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of numbers that are the vampire's victims. Question 3 asks about the characteristic of the "immune" numbers, which is related to the concept of the vampire's victims. Although the options do not directly match, the intent of the question is somewhat similar.

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to fully match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As Numberland’s best detective,
you thought you’d seen it all. But the desiccated corpses 
of prominent natural numbers— whole numbers greater than 0— have been showing up all over the city
for the past week. All of Digitopolis is on lockdown
from sundown to sunrise, and it’s still not enough to stop
what can only be described as a vampiric feeding frenzy. The police are helpless, 
and have turned to you. You put the missing persons case 
you’ve been investigating on hold and study the evidence. Here’s what you know: most victims have been completely
drained of their life’s essence. Some have a thin line of slime
separating digits— some of which were drained 
and others spared. Which leads you to mystery one: what’s the significance 
of the slime-lines, and why are certain digits untouched? Pause here to figure it out yourself. 
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s start by looking 
for a pattern in the victims. Why have some been fully drained,
and some slimed? Well, the slime-lined are in their prime— which is to say they’re prime numbers,
divisible only by 1 and themselves. Not a single one of the unslimed numbers,
on the other hand, is. Furthermore, the drained parts of the 
slimed primes are not, themselves, prime. When 71 got slimed, 7 was prime,
but 1 was not. If 461 had been split into 4 and 61,
the right side would have been prime, but instead it was split further
into non-prime digits. And when 2099 got slimed, 
the attacker went with 20 and 99, and was able to drain both. So you have a big problem. There are infinite potential victims: all non-prime numbers, and all prime numbers that can 
be slime-lined to reveal at least one non-prime number. In fact, you can only think of a few
numbers that aren't vulnerable. First of all, the one digit primes: 
2, 3, 5, and 7. Then primes like 23, which could only be
split into 2 and 3, both prime. These numbers are familiar, but why? Aha! Your missing person’s case. Someone is kidnapping the numbers
that can’t be drained: we’ll call them the immune. If you can identify the four immune 
who remain, perhaps you can get to them first
and figure out what’s going on. Who are the immune?
Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are 4 one-digit immune:
2, 3, 5, and 7. All have already been kidnapped. But every digit in all of the immune
must be one of those four numbers; otherwise there would be 
a non-prime split possible. That means there are only these 16
candidates among the two-digit numbers. The ones that are prime must be immune. We can eliminate anything 
that ends in 2 or 5, as they’ll always be divisible by 2 and 5. This diagonal is also out,
as they’re divisible by 11. If the digits of a number add
up to a multiple of 3, it’s divisible by 3. So that eliminates 57 and 27,
leaving these numbers. Which, upon double-checking, are, 
in fact, immune. We now have a strong starting point
for searching three-digit numbers: any 2 consecutive digits must be 
on the list of the two-digit immune. Those all end in 3 and 7, so the only possibilities
are these 8 options: the two-digit immune with additional
3s or 7s on their ends. 3 can’t follow 3,
nor 7 follow 7. And once again, adding the digits 
reveals that 237 and 537 are divisible by 3. 737 is 67 times 11, 
so that leaves just 373, which is, in fact, prime,
and therefore immune. Could a four-digit number be immune? No, any consecutive three digits
would have to be immune, and there’s no immune three digit
number that starts with a 7. You rush out, 
but reach each home too late, until the only immune left is 373. You’re in the nick of time to scare
off her would-be kidnapper; not the vampire itself but a minion. 373 explains that she and the other immune
are the subjects of an ancient prophecy that designated them as vampire slayers. They’d sometimes gather and try 
to figure out what a vampire is, but no one had the slightest idea. They found the idea of slaying
things quite distasteful. You both trail her would-be kidnapper
back to a foreboding castle. There you release the other 
kidnapped numbers and confront the vampire himself. He’s powerless before the slayers, 
but ever the pacifists, they round him up, return the lifeforce 
to his victims, and send him packing. Numberland is safe... for now.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the wording is different, the intent of Question 2 is similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the vampire's goal with the slime lines, and the correct answer is to isolate non-prime sequences in order to drain them. Question 2 asks why some digits of the slimed prime numbers were left untouched, and the implied answer (although not explicitly provided) is that they were prime numbers, which aligns with the concept of isolating non-prime sequences in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. Question 2 is the closest match, but it still requires some interpretation to connect it to the ground truth MCQ.

Options: A. They are all composite numbers, B. They are all prime numbers that cannot be split into non-prime digits, C. They are all even numbers, D. They are all odd numbers

This generated MCQ is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the characteristics of immune numbers. Although the question phrasing is different, the intent is similar, and the options provided are related to the properties of immune numbers.

However, it's worth noting that the ground truth MCQ asks which statement is false, whereas the generated MCQ asks for the characteristic of immune numbers. To make the generated MCQ more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the options could be rephrased to include statements about immune numbers, and the question could ask which statement is false.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that **Question 3** is the most similar generated MCQ, but with some modifications to the options and question phrasing, it could be even more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead,
there’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, 
O vile cockroach.” More than 3,000 years later, 
we’re still trying to oust these insects. But from poison traps 
to hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather 
just about everything we throw at them. So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill? There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species. 99% of them live in a range of habitats
where they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying 
organic matter and nourishing other animals. But a couple dozen species adapted to live
in close association with humans. German and American cockroaches
are among the most common. And they owe their resilience
to a combination of physical and chemical adaptations. When it comes to old-fashioned 
removal methods, they're troublingly tenacious. An American cockroach’s sensory hairs 
or structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals 
to its central nervous system. The roach can then turn and sprint
away within a few milliseconds. And it’s among the fastest invertebrates
ever recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50
body lengths per second. This would be the human equivalent of
running more than 300 kilometers per hour. And finding a hiding place is no problem. With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into 
spaces less than a quarter of its height. Even if we do land a hit, 
it can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight 
by distributing the impact along its body. And the cockroach’s toughness
doesn’t end there. Cockroaches can eat a variety 
of organic matter, including hair, dead skin, 
adhesives, and paper. This is made possible by an expansive set 
of digestive enzymes. Cockroaches are able to thrive 
even in nutrient-poor environments. Roaches often eat decaying foods
that are low in nitrogen— an essential component
of DNA and proteins. But they survive by storing 
nitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group
of bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them. Meanwhile, German cockroaches
will eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members 
without hesitation. An American cockroach will
frolic in sewers, consuming excrement and toting microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli. But they’ll rarely suffer
any consequences. This is because they’re equipped 
with genes that provide immunity against numerous pathogens. These genes are often duplicated 
many times over. So when infected, the cockroach’s 
immune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules. Cockroaches also have a slew of defenses
against pesticides. When a non-resistant roach walks 
on a surface that’s been sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide, 
for example, the results will likely be fatal. Once absorbed, the chemical binds
to sodium channel proteins, which help propagate nerve impulses. The pyrethroid keeps 
the sodium channels open, so the nerves fire repeatedly. And soon, the cockroach dies. But if a resistant roach is exposed 
to pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine. Genetic mutations have given
them sodium channels that the pyrethroids can’t bind to. The cockroach also produces more
detoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes 
it as a waste. Because German cockroaches
reproduce especially quickly, populations may evolve resistance 
to a new pesticide within months. So far, they're already resistant
to 43 different chemicals. But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive 
a nuclear apocalypse. Compared with other insects, cockroaches are only mildly
tolerant to radiation. They would die near the sites
of nuclear explosions and would still be severely
compromised miles away. Moreover, disasters that threaten humanity also jeopardize the habitats and buffets 
we provide roaches. Perhaps the only way to beat them 
is through our mutual destruction. Or maybe cockroaches would find 
even more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, the closest match can be inferred as follows:

The ground truth MCQ asks about the factors that contribute to cockroaches' resilience. According to the transcript, cockroaches owe their resilience to a combination of physical and chemical adaptations.

Among the generated MCQs, none directly address the factors contributing to cockroaches' resilience. However, some MCQs touch upon specific aspects of their physical and chemical adaptations.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, the closest match would be a generated MCQ that addresses cockroaches' adaptations or resilience. While there isn't a direct match, Question 7: "What provides immunity to cockroaches against numerous pathogens?" is related to their chemical adaptations (i.e., genes providing immunity).

However, since this is not a direct match, I must emphasize that the provided generated MCQs do not adequately match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the closest match based on the available options, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but with a significant caveat that it's not an ideal match.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQs are Question 3 and Question 4, which describe characteristics of American cockroaches that could contribute to their ability to escape stomping attempts. 

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar because it mentions the speed of the American cockroach, which is one of the characteristics mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

But I would like to note that a new generated MCQ that combines the content of Questions 3 and 4, and also includes the "flattened and flexible body" characteristic, would be a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

So, with the given options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Transcript**:
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead,
there’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, 
O vile cockroach.” More than 3,000 years later, 
we’re still trying to oust these insects. But from poison traps 
to hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather 
just about everything we throw at them. So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill? There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species. 99% of them live in a range of habitats
where they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying 
organic matter and nourishing other animals. But a couple dozen species adapted to live
in close association with humans. German and American cockroaches
are among the most common. And they owe their resilience
to a combination of physical and chemical adaptations. When it comes to old-fashioned 
removal methods, they're troublingly tenacious. An American cockroach’s sensory hairs 
or structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals 
to its central nervous system. The roach can then turn and sprint
away within a few milliseconds. And it’s among the fastest invertebrates
ever recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50
body lengths per second. This would be the human equivalent of
running more than 300 kilometers per hour. And finding a hiding place is no problem. With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into 
spaces less than a quarter of its height. Even if we do land a hit, 
it can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight 
by distributing the impact along its body. And the cockroach’s toughness
doesn’t end there. Cockroaches can eat a variety 
of organic matter, including hair, dead skin, 
adhesives, and paper. This is made possible by an expansive set 
of digestive enzymes. Cockroaches are able to thrive 
even in nutrient-poor environments. Roaches often eat decaying foods
that are low in nitrogen— an essential component
of DNA and proteins. But they survive by storing 
nitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group
of bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them. Meanwhile, German cockroaches
will eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members 
without hesitation. An American cockroach will
frolic in sewers, consuming excrement and toting microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli. But they’ll rarely suffer
any consequences. This is because they’re equipped 
with genes that provide immunity against numerous pathogens. These genes are often duplicated 
many times over. So when infected, the cockroach’s 
immune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules. Cockroaches also have a slew of defenses
against pesticides. When a non-resistant roach walks 
on a surface that’s been sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide, 
for example, the results will likely be fatal. Once absorbed, the chemical binds
to sodium channel proteins, which help propagate nerve impulses. The pyrethroid keeps 
the sodium channels open, so the nerves fire repeatedly. And soon, the cockroach dies. But if a resistant roach is exposed 
to pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine. Genetic mutations have given
them sodium channels that the pyrethroids can’t bind to. The cockroach also produces more
detoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes 
it as a waste. Because German cockroaches
reproduce especially quickly, populations may evolve resistance 
to a new pesticide within months. So far, they're already resistant
to 43 different chemicals. But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive 
a nuclear apocalypse. Compared with other insects, cockroaches are only mildly
tolerant to radiation. They would die near the sites
of nuclear explosions and would still be severely
compromised miles away. Moreover, disasters that threaten humanity also jeopardize the habitats and buffets 
we provide roaches. Perhaps the only way to beat them 
is through our mutual destruction. Or maybe cockroaches would find 
even more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about the dietary preference of pest cockroaches, it does relate to their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments due to their digestive system. The correct option, "It has an expansive set of digestive enzymes," implies that cockroaches are able to eat a wide variety of organic matter, which aligns with the concept of being omnivorous.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options. 

If I had to choose an index, I would choose Question 5 (Index 5).

**Transcript**:
Every year before the ancient Greeks
sowed their seeds of grain, they celebrated Demeter, 
the goddess of agriculture. On Earth, each morsel of food 
was sweet sustenance, while in the land of the dead,
it ensured a permanent stay. Demeter tended to Earth’s fields 
with her beloved daughter, Persephone, who inherited her mother’s passions
and grew into a bright young woman. But all the while, a shadowy figure
watched from below. One day, Persephone was frolicking
in a meadow with a freshwater nymph, Cyane. As they admired a blooming
narcissus flower, they noticed it tremble in the ground. Suddenly, the earth split, 
and a terrifying figure arose. It was Hades, god of the dead
and the underworld. He wrenched Persephone from Cyane,
dragged her into his inky chariot, and blasted back through the earth. Cyane wept so hard she dissolved,
becoming one with the river. By the time Demeter arrived 
at the scene of the abduction, the crater in the meadow had closed—
and Cyane and Persephone had vanished. Demeter sped to Mount Olympus for help. Many of the gods had witnessed the scene. And they knew about the deal 
that paved the way for it: Zeus, Persephone’s father, 
had granted Hades her hand in marriage without her consent— or Demeter’s. But when faced with Demeter’s pleas, 
the other gods stayed silent, So, she searched alone. In her grief and desperation, 
she neglected her usual tasks. Crops withered, and a great famine 
plagued the Earth. As mortals began to perish, 
the gods grew wary. Who would worship them and 
offer tributes if the humans disappeared? So, Zeus ordered Demeter to stop 
her crusade and returned to her duties. But she refused. Deep below, across the frigid river Styx,
and through the halls of the underworld, Persephone was waging her own protest. Hades expected her to serve
as his wife and queen. But Persephone rebuffed the god’s advances
and refused food. As she longed for her mother’s company, her friends’ laughter,
and the sun’s warmth, Persephone grew colder and lonelier. And she was starving. She hungered for satisfying grains,
crisp vegetables and fresh fruit. Wandering the ghostly gardens, she contemplated the pomegranates 
that hung heavily on their branches... Meanwhile, Demeter continued her hunt. She appealed to the all-seeing sun god,
Helios, whose rays had long warmed her crops. Indeed, when Helios drew his golden
chariot across the sky that fateful day, he saw what happened— 
and he knew of the deal. Out of respect and sympathy for Demeter, Helios told her of Hades’ demands,
Zeus’ betrayal and Persephone’s abduction. Furious and heartbroken, Demeter sped
to Mount Olympus and confronted Zeus, demanding their daughter’s return. But Zeus declined: in her ravenous hunger, Persephone had eaten a few seeds from the 
pomegranate that grew in the underworld. Though a meager amount, it was enough
to ensnare her in Hades forever. Demeter wouldn't accept this fate. She swore that if she wasn’t
reunited with Persephone, the fields would never be fertile again, and the distinction between the Earth 
and the underworld would soon dissolve. So, they made a pact. For two thirds of every year, Persephone 
would return to the land of the living, But for the remainder, she would stay 
in the world of the dead. When Persephone ascended to Earth,
she and her mother rejoiced. Together, they showered the fields 
with rain and nurtured them with sun. For mortals, Persephone’s arrival came
to herald the start of spring. But her descent always came too soon. Each time she returned to Hades, 
Demeter mourned, and the earth grew cold, 
dark, and unyielding, ushering in the winter months. Knowing Demeter couldn’t be roused 
from her grief, the humans stored their crops, 
stoked their fires, and awaited Persephone’s safe return. And so it was that her transit marked
the gradual turning of the seasons and the bittersweet compromise
between life and death.

**Transcript**:
Every year before the ancient Greeks
sowed their seeds of grain, they celebrated Demeter, 
the goddess of agriculture. On Earth, each morsel of food 
was sweet sustenance, while in the land of the dead,
it ensured a permanent stay. Demeter tended to Earth’s fields 
with her beloved daughter, Persephone, who inherited her mother’s passions
and grew into a bright young woman. But all the while, a shadowy figure
watched from below. One day, Persephone was frolicking
in a meadow with a freshwater nymph, Cyane. As they admired a blooming
narcissus flower, they noticed it tremble in the ground. Suddenly, the earth split, 
and a terrifying figure arose. It was Hades, god of the dead
and the underworld. He wrenched Persephone from Cyane,
dragged her into his inky chariot, and blasted back through the earth. Cyane wept so hard she dissolved,
becoming one with the river. By the time Demeter arrived 
at the scene of the abduction, the crater in the meadow had closed—
and Cyane and Persephone had vanished. Demeter sped to Mount Olympus for help. Many of the gods had witnessed the scene. And they knew about the deal 
that paved the way for it: Zeus, Persephone’s father, 
had granted Hades her hand in marriage without her consent— or Demeter’s. But when faced with Demeter’s pleas, 
the other gods stayed silent, So, she searched alone. In her grief and desperation, 
she neglected her usual tasks. Crops withered, and a great famine 
plagued the Earth. As mortals began to perish, 
the gods grew wary. Who would worship them and 
offer tributes if the humans disappeared? So, Zeus ordered Demeter to stop 
her crusade and returned to her duties. But she refused. Deep below, across the frigid river Styx,
and through the halls of the underworld, Persephone was waging her own protest. Hades expected her to serve
as his wife and queen. But Persephone rebuffed the god’s advances
and refused food. As she longed for her mother’s company, her friends’ laughter,
and the sun’s warmth, Persephone grew colder and lonelier. And she was starving. She hungered for satisfying grains,
crisp vegetables and fresh fruit. Wandering the ghostly gardens, she contemplated the pomegranates 
that hung heavily on their branches... Meanwhile, Demeter continued her hunt. She appealed to the all-seeing sun god,
Helios, whose rays had long warmed her crops. Indeed, when Helios drew his golden
chariot across the sky that fateful day, he saw what happened— 
and he knew of the deal. Out of respect and sympathy for Demeter, Helios told her of Hades’ demands,
Zeus’ betrayal and Persephone’s abduction. Furious and heartbroken, Demeter sped
to Mount Olympus and confronted Zeus, demanding their daughter’s return. But Zeus declined: in her ravenous hunger, Persephone had eaten a few seeds from the 
pomegranate that grew in the underworld. Though a meager amount, it was enough
to ensnare her in Hades forever. Demeter wouldn't accept this fate. She swore that if she wasn’t
reunited with Persephone, the fields would never be fertile again, and the distinction between the Earth 
and the underworld would soon dissolve. So, they made a pact. For two thirds of every year, Persephone 
would return to the land of the living, But for the remainder, she would stay 
in the world of the dead. When Persephone ascended to Earth,
she and her mother rejoiced. Together, they showered the fields 
with rain and nurtured them with sun. For mortals, Persephone’s arrival came
to herald the start of spring. But her descent always came too soon. Each time she returned to Hades, 
Demeter mourned, and the earth grew cold, 
dark, and unyielding, ushering in the winter months. Knowing Demeter couldn’t be roused 
from her grief, the humans stored their crops, 
stoked their fires, and awaited Persephone’s safe return. And so it was that her transit marked
the gradual turning of the seasons and the bittersweet compromise
between life and death.

**Transcript**:
You’re sitting on the couch watching TV,
when you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived 
to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has
always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing
a grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,
“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence 
against them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would
believe in this situation. This dilemma is part of what philosophers
call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores 
how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties
to believe certain things. The question here isn't about
what you should do, such as whether or not you should find
your spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury
in their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe
to be true. So, what factors should you consider? Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something
is to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps
us determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw
the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought 
to determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,
and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused 
is your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence 
from a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective 
of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character
is a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints 
at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe 
your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. Some philosophers present
evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century 
evidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence
is also morally required. One argument for this view is that 
having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining 
the ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something
unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is 
a way of being dishonest with oneself. However, perhaps there are other
ethical factors in play. Although the evidence against
your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that
they’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how 
it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—
not even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting
them in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack 
of trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult 
to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—
or even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe
that your spouse is innocent, but could you really 
go on living that lie? According to a theory of the ethics 
of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations
can sometimes make it right to believe something
even without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say 
that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. But is it even possible to believe
your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good
for your relationship? Or because you think you owe
it to the accused? You might desperately want 
to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the
same way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe
whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, 
recall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible
to control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? 
Can you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe
about your spouse?

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of "belief" discussed in the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 7: What is the central question raised by the transcript regarding the nature of belief?**

Although this question does not directly ask for the definition of "belief," it does touch on the concept of belief and how it is perceived in the context of the transcript.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more relevant to the definition of "belief," I would suggest:

**Question 9: What is the role of evidence in the context of the ethics of belief, according to the transcript?**

This question is related to the concept of belief, but it does not directly ask for the definition of "belief." Instead, it asks about the role of evidence in forming beliefs, which is a related concept discussed in the transcript.

In terms of question content, options, and overall intent, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would suggest **Question 9** as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is still not a perfect match.

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and intent of Question 9 are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks for the definition of 'evidence' used in the video, and the correct answer is "Evidence is all information that helps us determine what's true." Question 9 asks about the role of evidence in the context of the ethics of belief, and while the options do not include the exact definition, they relate to the concept of evidence and its significance in forming beliefs.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would select Question 9, but with the understanding that it's not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
You’re sitting on the couch watching TV,
when you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived 
to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has
always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing
a grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,
“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence 
against them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would
believe in this situation. This dilemma is part of what philosophers
call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores 
how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties
to believe certain things. The question here isn't about
what you should do, such as whether or not you should find
your spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury
in their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe
to be true. So, what factors should you consider? Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something
is to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps
us determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw
the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought 
to determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,
and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused 
is your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence 
from a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective 
of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character
is a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints 
at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe 
your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. Some philosophers present
evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century 
evidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence
is also morally required. One argument for this view is that 
having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining 
the ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something
unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is 
a way of being dishonest with oneself. However, perhaps there are other
ethical factors in play. Although the evidence against
your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that
they’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how 
it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—
not even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting
them in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack 
of trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult 
to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—
or even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe
that your spouse is innocent, but could you really 
go on living that lie? According to a theory of the ethics 
of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations
can sometimes make it right to believe something
even without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say 
that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. But is it even possible to believe
your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good
for your relationship? Or because you think you owe
it to the accused? You might desperately want 
to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the
same way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe
whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, 
recall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible
to control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? 
Can you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe
about your spouse?

We get it, not everyone loves snakes. You may not want to encounter one
in the wild. To each their own! That’s why we’re here, 
to take you on a world tour of some of nature’s most incredible snakes
from the safety of your home— and with your very own intrepid guide. All the snakes we’ll be visiting
belong to a group called the vipers. As of 2021, there are 368 species
of viper worldwide. The name comes from the term viviparity,
which means giving birth to live young. Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, most vipers have eggs 
that hatch inside the mother, who then gives birth 
to up to dozens of tiny snakes. Not glad you’re safe at home yet? Vipers are also often highly venomous, with two hollow fangs that fold flat
to the roofs of their mouths. This allows the fangs to be extra long, unfolding into imposing weapons
when the viper prepares to strike. So how about we pay them a surprise visit? First stop: 
the southeastern United States, where we can hear the viper
before we can see it. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is
the largest of 36 species of rattlesnake. Rattlesnakes can shake their rattles
up to 90 times per second to warn off predators 
for hours if needed. The rattle consists of hollow, interlocked
segments made of keratin, the same substance that makes
our nails and hair. When the snake shakes its tail,
these segments hit each other, creating a shockingly loud noise. Now onto the mountains of western Iran,
where a spider crawls across a rock, making easy prey for a passing bird—
or not. The spider-tailed horned viper is
perfectly camouflaged, almost invisible, except for its unique bulbous tail-tip
with long drooping scales that look like a leggy spider. Spider-tailed vipers
are only about 50 centimeters long, so they can lure small birds 
within striking range without compromising their ability 
to squeeze into narrow rock crevices. In the rainforests of Latin America 
lives a viper that couldn’t be more different
from the spider-tailed viper— if you can find it. It’s one of the most elusive snakes
in the world: the bushmaster. The bushmaster is a pit viper. Between each eye and nostril,
it has a heat-sensing pit with a membrane covered 
in highly sensitive receptors that respond to temperature changes as small as one one-thousandth 
of a degree Celsius. These pits gather infrared information
that is integrated with visual information in the optic tectum. This allows the bushmaster to “see” 
the heat signature of approaching prey or predators, helping it decide whether or not to strike
and strike more accurately. This comes in handy for guarding a nest— unlike most other vipers, 
the bushmaster lays eggs in hollowed out tree buttresses 
or burrows made by other animals. It must be large enough
to defend its nest— in fact, the bushmaster is the
largest viper in the world, reaching lengths of over 11 feet,
with huge fangs and deadly venom. Meanwhile, in the forests 
of sub-Saharan Africa, there’s a shorter, chunkier viper that’s 
even more venomous than the bushmaster. The African Gaboon viper has 
the longest fangs of any snake— yes, all 3,879 snake species, 
not just vipers— and can deliver 1,000 milligrams
of venom in a single bite— enough to kill ten adult humans. Although deadly, Gaboon vipers 
have a reputation for being slow-moving 
and placid creatures. When they do strike, they hold onto their 
rodent prey while the venom takes effect, then quickly swallow it down. At this point, you may be worrying
about our guide— but never fear, rodents like our little desert 
kangaroo rat have their own skills to evade the serpent’s tooth. They stomp their feet at rattlesnakes,
kick sand towards them, and evade their strikes 
with acrobatic leaps and powerful kicks— helping them live to guide 
another snake tour.

**Transcript**:
We get it, not everyone loves snakes. You may not want to encounter one
in the wild. To each their own! That’s why we’re here, 
to take you on a world tour of some of nature’s most incredible snakes
from the safety of your home— and with your very own intrepid guide. All the snakes we’ll be visiting
belong to a group called the vipers. As of 2021, there are 368 species
of viper worldwide. The name comes from the term viviparity,
which means giving birth to live young. Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, most vipers have eggs 
that hatch inside the mother, who then gives birth 
to up to dozens of tiny snakes. Not glad you’re safe at home yet? Vipers are also often highly venomous, with two hollow fangs that fold flat
to the roofs of their mouths. This allows the fangs to be extra long, unfolding into imposing weapons
when the viper prepares to strike. So how about we pay them a surprise visit? First stop: 
the southeastern United States, where we can hear the viper
before we can see it. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is
the largest of 36 species of rattlesnake. Rattlesnakes can shake their rattles
up to 90 times per second to warn off predators 
for hours if needed. The rattle consists of hollow, interlocked
segments made of keratin, the same substance that makes
our nails and hair. When the snake shakes its tail,
these segments hit each other, creating a shockingly loud noise. Now onto the mountains of western Iran,
where a spider crawls across a rock, making easy prey for a passing bird—
or not. The spider-tailed horned viper is
perfectly camouflaged, almost invisible, except for its unique bulbous tail-tip
with long drooping scales that look like a leggy spider. Spider-tailed vipers
are only about 50 centimeters long, so they can lure small birds 
within striking range without compromising their ability 
to squeeze into narrow rock crevices. In the rainforests of Latin America 
lives a viper that couldn’t be more different
from the spider-tailed viper— if you can find it. It’s one of the most elusive snakes
in the world: the bushmaster. The bushmaster is a pit viper. Between each eye and nostril,
it has a heat-sensing pit with a membrane covered 
in highly sensitive receptors that respond to temperature changes as small as one one-thousandth 
of a degree Celsius. These pits gather infrared information
that is integrated with visual information in the optic tectum. This allows the bushmaster to “see” 
the heat signature of approaching prey or predators, helping it decide whether or not to strike
and strike more accurately. This comes in handy for guarding a nest— unlike most other vipers, 
the bushmaster lays eggs in hollowed out tree buttresses 
or burrows made by other animals. It must be large enough
to defend its nest— in fact, the bushmaster is the
largest viper in the world, reaching lengths of over 11 feet,
with huge fangs and deadly venom. Meanwhile, in the forests 
of sub-Saharan Africa, there’s a shorter, chunkier viper that’s 
even more venomous than the bushmaster. The African Gaboon viper has 
the longest fangs of any snake— yes, all 3,879 snake species, 
not just vipers— and can deliver 1,000 milligrams
of venom in a single bite— enough to kill ten adult humans. Although deadly, Gaboon vipers 
have a reputation for being slow-moving 
and placid creatures. When they do strike, they hold onto their 
rodent prey while the venom takes effect, then quickly swallow it down. At this point, you may be worrying
about our guide— but never fear, rodents like our little desert 
kangaroo rat have their own skills to evade the serpent’s tooth. They stomp their feet at rattlesnakes,
kick sand towards them, and evade their strikes 
with acrobatic leaps and powerful kicks— helping them live to guide 
another snake tour.

**Transcript**:
He was born in the 1330s 
in the Chaghatayid Khanate formerly the Mongol Empire
in Central Asia. On the unforgiving steppe,
he rose from a lowly sheep thief to become one of history’s 
greatest conquerors, uniting nearly all of Central Asia, 
Afghanistan, and Iran under his rule. But was he a great state builder 
or a bloodthirsty tyrant? Order! Order! 
Who do we have on the stand today? Tamer...lane? That wasn’t his name, your Honor. The great Timur— meaning iron—
was nicknamed “Timur the lame” by enemies who mocked permanent 
injuries to his leg and arm. Injuries he sustained raiding
a rival tribe’s sheep herd— he was a thief and a scoundrel
from the start! Maybe— we actually don’t know for sure—
but even if that’s true, raiding rivals was just part 
of nomadic life at the time. Timur was not born into a ruling family, so he had to prove his worth 
through daring and horsemanship. He was hardly a commoner. Timur’s family was minor nobility. His uncle and brother-in-law were
high-ranking officials. And when they trusted Timur
on a diplomatic mission, he defected to a rival khan! Strategic maneuvering! He reconciled with his uncle 
and brother-in-law soon after. Only for long enough to consolidate
his own power. Then he went to battle against
his brother-in-law— supposedly his closest ally. He was assassinated,
and Timur seized power! They may have been friends, but he was a corrupt man 
who alienated a lot of people. Timur was right to oust him. Afterward, he managed to reunite 
most of the khanate’s territories and put an end to decades 
of bloody infighting. Okay, so where are we?
I can hardly keep up. 1370, your honor. And he’s khan now? Well, not quite. Timur was not a direct descendant 
of Genghis Khan, so he couldn’t claim the title. Instead, he appointed figurehead khans
and referred to himself as amir, or commander, 
and later as güregen, or son-in-law, after he married a woman who was 
descended from Genghis Khan. He claimed to be a divinely ordained
protector of the Mongol and Muslim worlds, yet he undermined both 
Mongol and Muslim power by relentlessly waging
war against his neighbors, weakening them so much that Christian
Europe romanticized him as an ally. His campaigns killed as many 
as 17 million people! Propaganda. Timur’s official biographies deliberately 
exaggerated the number of deaths to deter rebellions. Like the Mongols, Timur offered
cities the chance to surrender and only ordered massacres
if they revolted. He rebuilt irrigation canals
to support agriculture, and regularly distributed
food to the poor. Just in his hometown of Kesh, he paid for the meat of 20 sheep 
to be given to the poor every day. His campaigns were brutal, but by unifying Central Asia,
Afghanistan, and Iran, he was also able to reinvigorate
the Silk Road. Much of Eurasia benefited from the revival
of long-distance trade, and Central Asian cities,
such as Samarkand and Herat, became thriving commercial hubs
under his rule. And meanwhile, other cities 
like Baghdad, Aleppo, and Delhi were plundered and burned
and took decades to recover. This illiterate warlord destroyed
centuries’ worth of cultural heritage, leaving nothing but pyramids
of skulls in his wake. Timur may have been illiterate, but he was also an active patron
of culture and the arts. During his conquests, 
he spared artisans and scholars, sending them to work on public projects
like schools and mosques. Unlike many women in the world
at the time, his wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law were highly educated 
and politically active. Timur also personally met with—
and impressed— the famed Arab historian 
Ibn Khaldun in Damascus, and he so thoroughly mastered chess
that he is said to have enjoyed a more complex variant 
that was named for him. So what happened after that? Timur died from an illness in 1405,
when he was likely in his early 70s. The empire he founded lasted 
another hundred years, ushering in an architectural, artistic,
literary and scientific renaissance across Central Asia. In Samarkand, Timur’s grandson, 
Ulugh Beg, built the largest astronomical observatory
in the world at the time. Even after the fall of Timur's empire, his descendant Babur re-established
himself in India, founding the Mughal Empire, which would become home to nearly 
a quarter of the world’s population and which built such splendors
as the Red Fort and Taj Mahal. Timur's legacy is still celebrated
in monuments across Central Asia, where he is remembered as 
“Buyuk Babamiz” or “our great forefather.” And yet today in Europe, India,
and much of the Middle East, he's remembered as a butcher. That’s more reflection of the success
of his own propaganda than of the man himself. Hold on now, I think
I’ve almost got the king cornered! Emerging from relative obscurity,
Timur’s conquests formed a legacy lasting nearly 500 years 
that remains on trial even today.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that Question 4: "Why couldn't Timur claim the title of khan?" is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ "Which title did Timur use?". 

Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to Timur's title and the reason behind it. The correct option for Question 4, "He was not a direct descendant of Genghis Khan", is closely related to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, "Amir", as the text explains that Timur used the title "Amir" because he was not a direct descendant of Genghis Khan.

Ulugh Beg, built the largest astronomical observatory
in the world at the time. Even after the fall of Timur's empire, his descendant Babur re-established
himself in India, founding the Mughal Empire, which would become home to nearly 
a quarter of the world’s population and which built such splendors
as the Red Fort and Taj Mahal. Timur's legacy is still celebrated
in monuments across Central Asia, where he is remembered as 
“Buyuk Babamiz” or “our great forefather.” And yet today in Europe, India,
and much of the Middle East, he's remembered as a butcher. That’s more reflection of the success
of his own propaganda than of the man himself. Hold on now, I think
I’ve almost got the king cornered! Emerging from relative obscurity,
Timur’s conquests formed a legacy lasting nearly 500 years 
that remains on trial even today.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about something Timur did NOT do, and the options include rebuilding irrigation canals, replacing the covering of the Ka'bah in Mecca, ordering food distributed to the poor, and reviving long-distance Silk Road trade.

A generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 7: What was Timur's attitude towards artisans and scholars? Options: A. He persecuted them, B. He ignored them, C. He spared them and sent them to work on public projects, D. He forced them to convert to Islam

However, this generated MCQ does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

Question 5: What was the estimated number of deaths caused by Timur's campaigns? Options: A. 1 million, B. 5 million, C. 17 million, D. 20 million

This generated MCQ is related to something Timur did (or the consequences of his actions), but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

In conclusion, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would suggest Question 5. However, I would like to emphasize that this is not a good match, and a new generated MCQ should be created to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
He was born in the 1330s 
in the Chaghatayid Khanate formerly the Mongol Empire
in Central Asia. On the unforgiving steppe,
he rose from a lowly sheep thief to become one of history’s 
greatest conquerors, uniting nearly all of Central Asia, 
Afghanistan, and Iran under his rule. But was he a great state builder 
or a bloodthirsty tyrant? Order! Order! 
Who do we have on the stand today? Tamer...lane? That wasn’t his name, your Honor. The great Timur— meaning iron—
was nicknamed “Timur the lame” by enemies who mocked permanent 
injuries to his leg and arm. Injuries he sustained raiding
a rival tribe’s sheep herd— he was a thief and a scoundrel
from the start! Maybe— we actually don’t know for sure—
but even if that’s true, raiding rivals was just part 
of nomadic life at the time. Timur was not born into a ruling family, so he had to prove his worth 
through daring and horsemanship. He was hardly a commoner. Timur’s family was minor nobility. His uncle and brother-in-law were
high-ranking officials. And when they trusted Timur
on a diplomatic mission, he defected to a rival khan! Strategic maneuvering! He reconciled with his uncle 
and brother-in-law soon after. Only for long enough to consolidate
his own power. Then he went to battle against
his brother-in-law— supposedly his closest ally. He was assassinated,
and Timur seized power! They may have been friends, but he was a corrupt man 
who alienated a lot of people. Timur was right to oust him. Afterward, he managed to reunite 
most of the khanate’s territories and put an end to decades 
of bloody infighting. Okay, so where are we?
I can hardly keep up. 1370, your honor. And he’s khan now? Well, not quite. Timur was not a direct descendant 
of Genghis Khan, so he couldn’t claim the title. Instead, he appointed figurehead khans
and referred to himself as amir, or commander, 
and later as güregen, or son-in-law, after he married a woman who was 
descended from Genghis Khan. He claimed to be a divinely ordained
protector of the Mongol and Muslim worlds, yet he undermined both 
Mongol and Muslim power by relentlessly waging
war against his neighbors, weakening them so much that Christian
Europe romanticized him as an ally. His campaigns killed as many 
as 17 million people! Propaganda. Timur’s official biographies deliberately 
exaggerated the number of deaths to deter rebellions. Like the Mongols, Timur offered
cities the chance to surrender and only ordered massacres
if they revolted. He rebuilt irrigation canals
to support agriculture, and regularly distributed
food to the poor. Just in his hometown of Kesh, he paid for the meat of 20 sheep 
to be given to the poor every day. His campaigns were brutal, but by unifying Central Asia,
Afghanistan, and Iran, he was also able to reinvigorate
the Silk Road. Much of Eurasia benefited from the revival
of long-distance trade, and Central Asian cities,
such as Samarkand and Herat, became thriving commercial hubs
under his rule. And meanwhile, other cities 
like Baghdad, Aleppo, and Delhi were plundered and burned
and took decades to recover. This illiterate warlord destroyed
centuries’ worth of cultural heritage, leaving nothing but pyramids
of skulls in his wake. Timur may have been illiterate, but he was also an active patron
of culture and the arts. During his conquests, 
he spared artisans and scholars, sending them to work on public projects
like schools and mosques. Unlike many women in the world
at the time, his wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law were highly educated 
and politically active. Timur also personally met with—
and impressed— the famed Arab historian 
Ibn Khaldun in Damascus, and he so thoroughly mastered chess
that he is said to have enjoyed a more complex variant 
that was named for him. So what happened after that? Timur died from an illness in 1405,
when he was likely in his early 70s. The empire he founded lasted 
another hundred years, ushering in an architectural, artistic,
literary and scientific renaissance across Central Asia. In Samarkand, Timur’s grandson,

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an empire founded by one of Timur's descendants. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 9 mentions the fate of the empire founded by Timur after his death. This question is related to the legacy of Timur and his empire, which is also the theme of the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer match can be found in the transcript, where it is mentioned that Timur's descendant Babur re-established himself in India, founding the Mughal Empire. Unfortunately, this information is not used to create a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9, but with a note that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1859, miners following 
the Colorado gold rush woke up to another sunny day. Or so they thought. To their surprise,
they soon discovered it was actually 1 am; and the sky wasn’t lit by the Sun,
but rather by brilliant drapes of light. The blazing glow could be seen as far 
as the Caribbean, leading people in many regions to believe
that nearby cities had caught fire. But the true cause of what would come
to be known as the Carrington Event was a solar storm—
the largest in recorded history. Solar storms are one of many astrophysical
phenomena caused by magnetic fields. These fields are generated by movements 
of electrically charged particles like protons and electrons. For example, Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated by charged molten metals circulating in the planet's outer core. Similarly, the Sun’s magnetic field 
is generated by large convective movements in the plasma that composes the star. As this plasma slowly swirls, it creates areas of intense magnetic
activity called sunspots. The magnetic fields that form 
near these regions often become twisted and strained. And when they’re stretched too far,
they snap into simpler configurations, releasing energy that launches plasma
from the Sun’s surface. These explosions are known 
as coronal mass ejections. The plasma— mostly made of protons 
and electrons— accelerates rapidly, quickly reaching thousands
of kilometers per second. A typical coronal mass ejection covers
the distance between the Sun and the Earth in just a couple of days, flowing along the magnetic field 
that permeates the solar system. And those that cross the Earth’s path
are drawn to its magnetic field lines, falling into the atmosphere 
around the planet’s magnetic poles. This tidal wave of high-energy particles
excites atmospheric atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to rapidly shed
photons at various energy levels. The result is a magnificent light show
we know as the auroras. And while this phenomenon is usually 
only visible near the Earth’s poles, strong solar storms can bring in 
enough high energy particles to light up large stretches of the sky. The magnetic fields in our solar system
are nothing compared to those found in deep space. Some neutron stars generate fields 
100 billion times stronger than those found in sunspots. And the magnetic fields 
around supermassive black holes expel jets of gas that extend 
for thousands of light years. However, on Earth, even weak solar storms
can be surprisingly dangerous. While the storms that reach us 
are generally harmless to humans, the high-energy particles 
falling into the atmosphere create secondary magnetic fields, which in turn generate rogue currents 
that short-circuit electrical equipment. During the Carrington Event, the only widespread electrical
technology was the telegraph. But since then, we've only become more
dependent on electrical systems. In 1921, another powerful solar
storm caused telephones and telegraph equipment 
around the globe to combust. In New York, the entire railway system 
was shut down and fires broke out in the central control building. Comparatively weak storms in 1989 and 2003 turned off regions 
of the Canadian power grid and damaged multiple satellites. If we were hit by a storm as strong
as the Carrington Event today, it could devastate our interconnected,
electrified planet. Fortunately, we're not defenseless. After centuries of observing sunspots, researchers have learned 
the Sun’s usual magnetic activity follows an 11-year cycle, giving us a window into when solar storms
are most likely to occur. And as our ability to forecast
space weather has improved, so have our mitigation measures. Power grids can be shut off 
in advance of a solar storm, while capacitors can be installed 
to absorb the sudden influx of energy. Many modern satellites and spacecraft 
are equipped with special shielding to absorb the impact of a solar storm. But even with these safeguards, it’s hard to say how our technology 
will fare during the next major event. It’s possible we’ll be left with only
the aurora overhead to light the path forward.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks what generates magnetic fields in general, while Question 2 asks what generates Earth's magnetic field. Both questions are related to the generation of magnetic fields, and the correct option for Question 2 (A. Charged molten metals circulating in the planet's outer core) is similar to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (C. The movement of electrically charged particles). 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 2 is the closest approximation.

they soon discovered it was actually 1 am; and the sky wasn’t lit by the Sun,

of the Canadian power grid and damaged multiple satellites. If we were hit by a storm as strong
as the Carrington Event today, it could devastate our interconnected,
electrified planet. Fortunately, we're not defenseless. After centuries of observing sunspots, researchers have learned 
the Sun’s usual magnetic activity follows an 11-year cycle, giving us a window into when solar storms
are most likely to occur. And as our ability to forecast
space weather has improved, so have our mitigation measures. Power grids can be shut off 
in advance of a solar storm, while capacitors can be installed 
to absorb the sudden influx of energy. Many modern satellites and spacecraft 
are equipped with special shielding to absorb the impact of a solar storm. But even with these safeguards, it’s hard to say how our technology 
will fare during the next major event. It’s possible we’ll be left with only
the aurora overhead to light the path forward.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question is about the frequency of the Sun's magnetic activity cycle, which is related to the likelihood of solar storms occurring. The correct option, "Every 11 years," is mentioned in the transcript as the usual cycle of the Sun's magnetic activity, giving a window into when solar storms are most likely to occur. This matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the peak of the solar cycle and its relation to the likelihood of solar storms. 

Although the wording and options are not identical, Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
It’s your first day in your new job 
as Center Realm’s official cartographer, and you've already got a big problem. Center Realm is home to three 
elder dragons: two ice, one fire, and they’ve lived in harmony 
on the east coast for centuries. But scouts have sighted three fire dragons
and five ice dragons flying across the Western Ocean. You’ll only have a few hours to assign 
them their designated regions before they’ll arrive. Elder dragons are extremely territorial. Each must have its own, 
officially acknowledged stomping ground. They’ll peacefully roost there unless
their region borders another dragon of the same type, in which case the matching dragons 
will go on a rampage. However, fire and ice dragons 
can border each other, and matching regions can touch at corners. You’ll soon have 11 dragons
and just 8 regions. Fortunately, you have enough 
political capital to create 3 new regions, each of which must be 
completely enclosed spaces. Add more or otherwise mess this up,
and you’ll lose your job and your head. Where do you draw lines 
and place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It isn't difficult to create
three new regions. What is more challenging 
is to make sure the result will keep each dragon
away from its own kind. For instance, this can be 
neither ice nor fire, because it borders both. However, create a new region like this,
and suddenly there are viable options. Why did that work? Look at the point
where these four regions meet. If you go around it, it alternates
between fire and ice. Before the new line was added,
that wouldn’t have worked. Nor would 5 or 7 regions. 6 and 8, however, both do. The pattern is that points where lines
meet must be surrounded by an even number of regions. As long as that’s true, you can color 
the map in two colors, by alternating them around those points. In our initial arrangement,
there were six such meeting points. So what we want to do is connect
those to each other. Each line adds a single new region
that touches both meeting points. There are several ways to do this
to accommodate all 8 new dragons. You’ve done such a great job 
that your boss puts you in a ship and sends you out across the Western Sea
to investigate where these new dragons are coming from. There you’re met
with a civilization in disarray. Their 17 elder dragons are ravaging 
the countryside, wiping out the peasants, devastating all the people 
and their thatch-roofed cottages. And here there aren't just ice and fire
dragons, but lightning dragons too. Their people will only allow 
the creation of two new regions. Where do you create new regions
and place all the dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Unfortunately, our meeting-point trick
won’t suffice now that there are three dragon types, so we need to find another
method to identify problem areas. A great way to do so is to experiment: focus on one area and start coloring
until we run out of possibilities. Take this section. These 3 regions all border each other,
so they need to be different colors. But they also all touch this giant
territory, which we now can’t color. To generalize the issue, when there are
4 regions that all border each other, it's impossible to color
them with three colors. The map has two other such areas. So what you need to do is break them up. And once again, the key is drawing lines
between points where multiple problematic regions touch. No matter how you do it, you’ll effectively subdivide 
the giant territory into smaller ones. Now coloring the map becomes
a logic puzzle. So long as you approach it systematically
by starting in one area and radiating out, you’ll reach an arrangement 
that you can fit all your dragons into, shifting the colors as needed. Just assign this region last, 
because it’ll have two options. You've saved not one, but two continents
from certain ruin. Now to see if you can find a giant eagle
and hitch a ride back home.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the shape of the home region that elder dragons prefer, and the correct answer is "Any shape at all." While none of the generated MCQs ask about the shape of the home region, Question 2 mentions a condition for the dragons to peacefully roost in their regions, which is related to the concept of the home region.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 3 is the most similar in terms of question intent. Question 3 asks, "Why is it challenging to create new regions for the dragons?" and one of the options is "Because the result must keep each dragon away from its own kind." This option is related to the concept of the home region and the fact that elder dragons are territorial.

Therefore, I would suggest that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

and place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It isn't difficult to create
three new regions. What is more challenging 
is to make sure the result will keep each dragon
away from its own kind. For instance, this can be 
neither ice nor fire, because it borders both. However, create a new region like this,
and suddenly there are viable options. Why did that work? Look at the point
where these four regions meet. If you go around it, it alternates
between fire and ice. Before the new line was added,
that wouldn’t have worked. Nor would 5 or 7 regions. 6 and 8, however, both do. The pattern is that points where lines
meet must be surrounded by an even number of regions. As long as that’s true, you can color 
the map in two colors, by alternating them around those points. In our initial arrangement,
there were six such meeting points. So what we want to do is connect
those to each other. Each line adds a single new region
that touches both meeting points. There are several ways to do this
to accommodate all 8 new dragons. You’ve done such a great job 
that your boss puts you in a ship and sends you out across the Western Sea
to investigate where these new dragons are coming from. There you’re met
with a civilization in disarray. Their 17 elder dragons are ravaging 
the countryside, wiping out the peasants, devastating all the people 
and their thatch-roofed cottages. And here there aren't just ice and fire
dragons, but lightning dragons too. Their people will only allow 
the creation of two new regions. Where do you create new regions
and place all the dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Unfortunately, our meeting-point trick
won’t suffice now that there are three dragon types, so we need to find another
method to identify problem areas. A great way to do so is to experiment: focus on one area and start coloring
until we run out of possibilities. Take this section. These 3 regions all border each other,
so they need to be different colors. But they also all touch this giant
territory, which we now can’t color. To generalize the issue, when there are
4 regions that all border each other, it's impossible to color
them with three colors. The map has two other such areas. So what you need to do is break them up. And once again, the key is drawing lines
between points where multiple problematic regions touch. No matter how you do it, you’ll effectively subdivide 
the giant territory into smaller ones. Now coloring the map becomes
a logic puzzle. So long as you approach it systematically
by starting in one area and radiating out, you’ll reach an arrangement 
that you can fit all your dragons into, shifting the colors as needed. Just assign this region last, 
because it’ll have two options. You've saved not one, but two continents
from certain ruin. Now to see if you can find a giant eagle
and hitch a ride back home.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the effect of adding lines to an existing map on the number of regions. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, which is about how the cartographer solves the problem of accommodating the new dragons in Center Realm. Although it does not directly address the effect of adding lines on the number of regions, it mentions the cartographer's solution, which involves creating new regions by connecting meeting points.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 3 has an option B that mentions "the new regions must be completely enclosed spaces." This option is related to the concept of adding lines to an existing map and its effect on the number of regions.

But the most relevant generated MCQ is not among the provided options. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (with reservations)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the ground truth MCQ's intent, and a more accurate match would require a new generated MCQ that specifically targets the concept of adding lines to an existing map and its effect on the number of regions.

**Transcript**:
It’s your first day in your new job 
as Center Realm’s official cartographer, and you've already got a big problem. Center Realm is home to three 
elder dragons: two ice, one fire, and they’ve lived in harmony 
on the east coast for centuries. But scouts have sighted three fire dragons
and five ice dragons flying across the Western Ocean. You’ll only have a few hours to assign 
them their designated regions before they’ll arrive. Elder dragons are extremely territorial. Each must have its own, 
officially acknowledged stomping ground. They’ll peacefully roost there unless
their region borders another dragon of the same type, in which case the matching dragons 
will go on a rampage. However, fire and ice dragons 
can border each other, and matching regions can touch at corners. You’ll soon have 11 dragons
and just 8 regions. Fortunately, you have enough 
political capital to create 3 new regions, each of which must be 
completely enclosed spaces. Add more or otherwise mess this up,
and you’ll lose your job and your head. Where do you draw lines 
and place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.

**Transcript**:
You’re a butterfly, fluttering around
pursuing a butterfly’s whims. Then you wake up. But how do you know
you’re not dreaming now? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s actually very difficult 
to explain how, definitively, you know you’re awake. So difficult, in fact, that it has puzzled
philosophers since ancient times. In the butterfly scenario, the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi
surfaced a mystifying possibility: if we can dream of being 
an entirely different creature, who's to say we're not actually a different creature dreaming 
of being human? Bizarre things happen in dreams: you fly, or conjure an all-you-can-eat 
dessert buffet out of thin air, or get chased by witches through the halls
of your elementary school, which suddenly looks a lot like Paris. But the strange things that happen 
in dreams don’t seem strange at the time. So how do you know you’re not
in a dream right now that will seem very strange
after you wake up? Well, it is possible to notice the strangeness of a dream
while you’re dreaming. Lucid dreamers know they’re dreaming. By definition, if you were having 
a lucid dream, you would know it. But all that proves is 
that you’re not having a lucid dream— it doesn’t prove you’re awake. There has to be a surefire test— something that never— or only—
happens when you’re awake, something that never— or only—
happens in a dream. Wake up.
No, that isn’t it— you can wake up in a dream. Pinch yourself.
If it hurts, aren’t you really awake? Try to read or write something. Run around the room. Does your pace seem normal 
or suspiciously slow? Suspiciously fast? Can’t tell? Try to remember
the last time you ran. Actually, that brings us 
to an even better test from the 17th century French philosopher
René Descartes. He pointed out that in our memories,
dreams are disconnected— the events of a dream don’t fit
in to the chain of events in our waking lives. This seems rock solid, doesn't it? You couldn’t possibly have swum 
with dolphins in a nameless pink sea between Christmas 
and New Year’s Eve because you didn’t leave Kansas 
and you have the receipts to prove it. Well, one of Descartes’ contemporaries, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes,
had something to say about that: what if Descartes was performing his test
in a dream? What if we ask an expert? A neuroscientist can measure the activity
in different parts of your brain and tell you whether you’re awake
or sleeping. But that just brings us back to the idea
that any test you might use to prove you’re awake 
could take place in a dream. So far, no one has found
a convincing response to this. But let’s be real: there’s a whole lot
more detail in our waking experience than in dreams. We go to sleep and wake up again
day after day for many years, and each new day is full  of countless 
people, places, things, experiences. Even our memories, which capture 
just a fraction of this experience, contain an almost incomprehensibly vast
amount of detail: we can recall a line from a favorite book
decades later, remember the musty smell of its pages and the taste of the lemonade we drank 
while reading it, remember a dream we had
about it and tell someone all this. Isn't it ridiculous to suggest a dream
could ever simulate this richness? Well, as the Persian philosopher
al-Ghazali pointed out, in the same way we think we are now awake
having woken from dreams, it is possible that we might wake 
from our current state into another state 
of even greater wakefulness. Which would mean we’re really
in a kind of dream-state when we think we’re awake. What philosophers really want to know 
is what justifies our belief that we’re awake. We all want to believe things
because we have reasons for them, not just because they seem right. Sometimes, the biggest challenge is 
to show why we should believe something that seems completely obvious to us all.

You’re a butterfly, fluttering around
pursuing a butterfly’s whims. Then you wake up. But how do you know
you’re not dreaming now? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s actually very difficult 
to explain how, definitively, you know you’re awake. So difficult, in fact, that it has puzzled
philosophers since ancient times. In the butterfly scenario, the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi
surfaced a mystifying possibility: if we can dream of being 
an entirely different creature, who's to say we're not actually a different creature dreaming 
of being human? Bizarre things happen in dreams: you fly, or conjure an all-you-can-eat 
dessert buffet out of thin air, or get chased by witches through the halls
of your elementary school, which suddenly looks a lot like Paris. But the strange things that happen 
in dreams don’t seem strange at the time. So how do you know you’re not
in a dream right now that will seem very strange
after you wake up? Well, it is possible to notice the strangeness of a dream
while you’re dreaming. Lucid dreamers know they’re dreaming. By definition, if you were having 
a lucid dream, you would know it. But all that proves is 
that you’re not having a lucid dream— it doesn’t prove you’re awake. There has to be a surefire test— something that never— or only—
happens when you’re awake, something that never— or only—
happens in a dream. Wake up.
No, that isn’t it— you can wake up in a dream. Pinch yourself.
If it hurts, aren’t you really awake? Try to read or write something. Run around the room. Does your pace seem normal 
or suspiciously slow? Suspiciously fast? Can’t tell? Try to remember
the last time you ran. Actually, that brings us 
to an even better test from the 17th century French philosopher
René Descartes. He pointed out that in our memories,
dreams are disconnected— the events of a dream don’t fit
in to the chain of events in our waking lives. This seems rock solid, doesn't it? You couldn’t possibly have swum 
with dolphins in a nameless pink sea between Christmas 
and New Year’s Eve because you didn’t leave Kansas 
and you have the receipts to prove it. Well, one of Descartes’ contemporaries, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes,
had something to say about that: what if Descartes was performing his test
in a dream? What if we ask an expert? A neuroscientist can measure the activity
in different parts of your brain and tell you whether you’re awake
or sleeping. But that just brings us back to the idea
that any test you might use to prove you’re awake 
could take place in a dream. So far, no one has found
a convincing response to this. But let’s be real: there’s a whole lot
more detail in our waking experience than in dreams. We go to sleep and wake up again
day after day for many years, and each new day is full  of countless 
people, places, things, experiences. Even our memories, which capture 
just a fraction of this experience, contain an almost incomprehensibly vast
amount of detail: we can recall a line from a favorite book
decades later, remember the musty smell of its pages and the taste of the lemonade we drank 
while reading it, remember a dream we had
about it and tell someone all this. Isn't it ridiculous to suggest a dream
could ever simulate this richness? Well, as the Persian philosopher
al-Ghazali pointed out, in the same way we think we are now awake
having woken from dreams, it is possible that we might wake 
from our current state into another state 
of even greater wakefulness. Which would mean we’re really
in a kind of dream-state when we think we’re awake. What philosophers really want to know 
is what justifies our belief that we’re awake. We all want to believe things
because we have reasons for them, not just because they seem right. Sometimes, the biggest challenge is 
to show why we should believe something that seems completely obvious to us all.

**Transcript**:
It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944 and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic 368 kilometer journey. He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather, flying an average of 79 kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight. Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the D-Day invasion back to England. He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment. Paddy was one of around 250,000 pigeons used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages. In fact, pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices. Seeing their meat as a protein source and their nitrogen-rich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer, humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as 10,000 years ago. We then tapped into other traits. Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct that drives them to navigate
long distances back to the location they consider “home.” So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing. In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying,” people selected for traits 
like head plumage and fabulously feathered feet. As we carried pigeons around the world,
they escaped or were released, forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today. Pigeons are now one of the most abundant,
widespread species on the planet, managing to thrive in chaotic cities. They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits, including some that were
accentuated by humans. Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees, pigeons were originally cliff-dwellers. City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat. And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking. Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass and it's a great spot to raise babies. This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments where more specialized species can’t. As generalists, pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste. With an organ in their throats 
called a crop, they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later. They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food. Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and protein-rich meal. If conditions are right,
pigeons breed year-round and produce new offspring every six weeks. They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities because of the abundance 
of food and shelter. These booming populations 
attract predators. New York City is home 
to a million pigeons, which support large populations
of raptors. But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight, further exploited by being bred
for racing, means they’re made 
for high speed chases. Compared to barn owls,
which are a similar size, pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved, providing extra space for muscle mass. They can reach speeds 
of 125 kilometers per hour. And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout. While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife, we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors. In 1966, New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings” and it stuck. Indeed, their poop, which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer, presents a unique problem. Just one pigeon can leave behind 
11 kilograms of acidic excrement per year, which, in the United States, 
scales to about $1.1 billion in structural damage annually. Though incidents of infection are rare, this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled. They may be numerous, noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, 
ongoing relationship. Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort. For better or for worse, 
we did this to ourselves.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Approximately how long ago did humans bring pigeons into captivity?
Options: A. 100 years ago, B. 1,000 years ago, C. 5,000 years ago, D. 10,000 years ago

Question 2: What is the name of the hobby where people select and breed pigeons for traits like head plumage and fabulously feathered feet? Options: A. Pigeon racing, B. Pigeon fancying, C. Pigeon breeding, D. Pigeon training Correct Option: None
Question 3: Why are pigeons able to thrive in chaotic cities? Options: A. Because they are specialized species, B. Because they have a powerful homing instinct, C.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 3: "Why are pigeons able to thrive in chaotic cities?" is the closest match.

This question touches on the idea of pigeons being brought into captivity and adapting to human environments, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about humans bringing pigeons into captivity approximately 10,000 years ago.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly address the timeframe or specifics of the ground truth MCQ, I must emphasize that this is a rough match at best.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 3 is the most similar, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

as far back as 10,000 years ago. We then tapped into other traits. Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct that drives them to navigate
long distances back to the location they consider “home.” So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing. In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying,” people selected for traits 
like head plumage and fabulously feathered feet. As we carried pigeons around the world,
they escaped or were released, forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today. Pigeons are now one of the most abundant,
widespread species on the planet, managing to thrive in chaotic cities. They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits, including some that were
accentuated by humans. Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees, pigeons were originally cliff-dwellers. City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat. And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking. Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass and it's a great spot to raise babies. This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments where more specialized species can’t. As generalists, pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste. With an organ in their throats 
called a crop, they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later. They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food. Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and protein-rich meal. If conditions are right,
pigeons breed year-round and produce new offspring every six weeks. They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities because of the abundance 
of food and shelter. These booming populations 
attract predators. New York City is home 
to a million pigeons, which support large populations
of raptors. But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight, further exploited by being bred
for racing, means they’re made 
for high speed chases. Compared to barn owls,
which are a similar size, pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved, providing extra space for muscle mass. They can reach speeds 
of 125 kilometers per hour. And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout. While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife, we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors. In 1966, New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings” and it stuck. Indeed, their poop, which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer, presents a unique problem. Just one pigeon can leave behind 
11 kilograms of acidic excrement per year, which, in the United States, 
scales to about $1.1 billion in structural damage annually. Though incidents of infection are rare, this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled. They may be numerous, noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, 
ongoing relationship. Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort. For better or for worse, 
we did this to ourselves.

It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944 and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic 368 kilometer journey. He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather, flying an average of 79 kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight. Paddy’s carrying the first news

**Transcript**:
As a new widow, Sarah Rosas Garcia was already struggling to support
her nine children when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities. Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter
would be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place 
in Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been
efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some
traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery
of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down. However, their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color
and people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans
of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called
“racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, 
and people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden, 
Canada, and Japan forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were 
59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims 
of these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including
sterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research 
into human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers, and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 1979. Unfortunately today, the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities still continues around the globe.

thousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were 
59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims 
of these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including
sterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research

to blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest

were finally repealed in 1979. Unfortunately today, the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities still continues around the globe.

**Transcript**:
As a new widow, Sarah Rosas Garcia was already struggling to support
her nine children when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities. Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter
would be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place 
in Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been
efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some
traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery
of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down. However, their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color
and people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans
of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called
“racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, 
and people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden,

**Transcript**:
The moon goddess, Ix Chel, patiently
watched a spider at work. She could make use of it skills, 
she thought. Through careful observation and imitation,
she soon became a skilled weaver. The sun god, Kinich Ahau, 
was impressed with her work, and admired her from afar. But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter. To get past the grandfather,
the sun god disguised himself as a hummingbird. As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey, the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather to capture the bird for her. The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings
and fly again. He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess to escape with him. The two rowed away in a canoe, but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god to help him stop them. Sensing danger, the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below and transformed into a crab. But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered, buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body. For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, 
cleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs. On the thirteenth night, 
the logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever. The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage. The moon goddess happily agreed. Side-by-side, they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays. Unfortunately, the story 
doesn’t end there. The sun god’s brother visited often. Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel, 
the sun god grew jealous, and began to mistreat her. One day, Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank, furious at her husband. A huge bird came gliding down and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks. To get away from the cruel sun god,
she agreed. There, she met the king of the vultures. The vulture king was kind and fun-loving— a much better partner
than the violent sun god. The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains. When the sun god heard, he was distraught. He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down, then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king. He begged her to come home with him,
apologizing for how he had treated her. The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back. But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again. He struck her, scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays. Ix Chel flew off into the dark. From then on, she vowed 
to appear only at night. She befriended the stars, and combined
her pale blue rays with their light to guide night travelers to safety. She used her healing gift, which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god, to cure people who were ill. Today, Ix Chel is so widely known that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture. But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities. In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists, the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends beyond the limits 
of the historical record. Her story, like all myths, 
isn’t just one story: the variations, ancient and modern,
speak to what people value, and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is the closest. This question mentions Ix Chel using her pale blue rays combined with the light of the stars to guide night travelers to safety, which is a skill or ability attributed to her. However, it does not mention the skill of healing or weaving, which are the two skills mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The moon goddess, Ix Chel, patiently
watched a spider at work. She could make use of it skills, 
she thought. Through careful observation and imitation,
she soon became a skilled weaver. The sun god, Kinich Ahau, 
was impressed with her work, and admired her from afar. But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter. To get past the grandfather,
the sun god disguised himself as a hummingbird. As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey, the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather to capture the bird for her. The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings
and fly again. He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess to escape with him. The two rowed away in a canoe, but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god to help him stop them. Sensing danger, the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below and transformed into a crab. But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered, buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body. For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, 
cleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs. On the thirteenth night, 
the logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever. The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage. The moon goddess happily agreed. Side-by-side, they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays. Unfortunately, the story 
doesn’t end there. The sun god’s brother visited often. Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel, 
the sun god grew jealous, and began to mistreat her. One day, Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank, furious at her husband. A huge bird came gliding down and offered to take her

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 6: What does Ix Chel's story represent in Maya culture?**

Although the question itself does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, one of its options (C) mentions that Ix Chel is "A symbol of Maya culture and values." Additionally, the passage associated with this question provides information about Ix Chel's role in Maya culture and how her story has been retold and modified over time, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's discussion of whether Ix Chel and the moon goddess were always the same deity.

However, a more suitable match can be found in the options of **Question 10: Analytical Question: What does the merging of Ix Chel and the moon goddess in retellings of Maya mythology suggest about the nature of myths and cultural stories?**

Here, option C states that myths and cultural stories "reflect the values and perspectives of the people who tell them," which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ's discussion of how Ix Chel's story has been retold and modified over time, and how she may not have always been the same deity as the moon goddess.

But since none of the generated questions directly ask about Ix Chel's identity as the moon goddess, the best match is **Question 10**.

republics and ukraine the second most powerful it had defence industries large agricultural lands and housed much of the soviet nuclear arsenal during the cold war ukraine was the arch rival of the united states the soviet union collapsed in 1991 ukraine became independent as did russia ukraine inherited much of soviet nuclear arsenal but gave it up to russia in 1994. in exchange moscow guaranteed ukraine's security and promised to respect its sovereignty they signed the budapest memorandum along with these countries cut to november 2013 viktor yanukovych was the president of ukraine he had a reputation for heavy-handedness corruption and above all for being openly pro-moscow in 2013 he rejected an eu trade deal this deal could have meant greater integration with the european union instead yanukovych decided to take a 15 billion dollar bailout from russia to many ukrainians it felt like being sold to moscow so protests broke out they were called euromaidan euro because these protests were about europe and maidan because they happened in kiev's maidan what we today know as the independent square here protesters chanted signed the eu deal yanukovych must step down

khrushchev transferred crimea it was given to the ukrainian soviet socialist republic from the russian soviet socialist republic why khrushchev hoped the transfer would strengthen quote unquote brotherly ties between the ukrainian and russian people both russia and crimea were part of the soviet union so this transfer did not mean very much when ukraine became independent in 1991 crimea joined it the peninsula was given special autonomy it remained home to russian military bases moscow promised to respect crimean autonomy many in russia were of the opinion that crimea should not have been allowed to join ukraine in 2014 when yanukovych was ousted from power in ukraine russian military began seizing government buildings in crimea so the entire peninsula was under military occupation a referendum followed on the 16th of march 2014 crimeans voted to become a part of russia was this vote legitimate well it depends on who you ask for putin this was crimea's liberation for

The ground truth MCQ asks about the ruler of the Kievan Rus between 980 and 1015. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions the Kievan Rus as the state in the 9th century where the Slavic people lived and had Kiev as their capital.

Although Question 2 does not ask about the ruler of the Kievan Rus, it is the only generated MCQ that mentions the Kievan Rus, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

will russia go to war with ukraine all week you've heard numerous answers to this question in ukraine 71 of the people believe their country is already at war with russia this is a complex crisis and all the answers are hidden in history did you know there was a time when kier was more powerful than moscow there was also a time when ukraine and america were adversaries tonight we'll bring you all these stories we will tell you why russian president vladimir putin is obsessed with ukraine i'm palki sharma padhya and this is gravitas plus we begin in the ninth century there was a state called kevin ruse this is where it was located the slavic people lived here the city of kiev was their capital between 980 and 1015 the kevin ruse was ruled by grand prince volodymir in russian his name is vladimir in ukrainian volodymir and as fate would have it these are also the names of the presidents of these two countries today anyway russians ukrainians and better russians draw their lineage from this slavic state a lot changed in the centuries that followed and for a lot of it ukraine was under russian rule in the 1900s the two were soviet republics russia the most powerful of the 15 republics and ukraine the second most powerful it had defence industries large agricultural lands and housed much of the soviet nuclear arsenal during the cold war ukraine was the arch rival of the united states the soviet union collapsed in 1991 ukraine became independent as did russia ukraine inherited much of soviet nuclear arsenal but gave it up to russia in 1994. in exchange moscow guaranteed ukraine's security and promised to respect its sovereignty they signed the budapest memorandum along with these countries cut to november 2013 viktor yanukovych was the president of ukraine he had a reputation for heavy-handedness corruption and above all for being openly pro-moscow in 2013 he rejected an eu trade deal this deal could have meant greater integration with the european union instead yanukovych decided to take a 15 billion dollar bailout from russia to many ukrainians it felt like being sold to moscow so protests broke out they were called euromaidan euro because these protests were about europe and maidan because they happened in kiev's maidan what we today know as the independent square here protesters chanted signed the eu deal yanukovych must step down russia supported the president the west supported the protesters in february 2014 yanukovich's government was toppled the president was driven out of ukraine he fled to russia not every ukrainian was happy with this many in the russian speaking east wanted yanukovich to stay when he was driven out the minority felt disenfranchised on the other side of the border russia was angry it had lost its puppet to salvage the situation moscow annexed crimea why crimea well let's now zoom into this part of the world crimea is a peninsula it is located in the black sea in 1954 soviet leader nikita khrushchev transferred crimea it was given to the ukrainian soviet socialist republic from the russian soviet socialist republic why khrushchev hoped the transfer would strengthen quote unquote brotherly ties between the ukrainian and russian people both russia and crimea were part of the soviet union so this transfer did not mean very much when ukraine became independent in 1991 crimea joined it the peninsula was given special autonomy it remained home to russian military bases moscow promised to respect crimean autonomy many in russia were of the opinion that crimea should not have been allowed to join ukraine in 2014 when yanukovych was ousted from power in ukraine russian military began seizing government buildings in crimea so the entire peninsula was under military occupation a referendum followed on the 16th of march 2014 crimeans voted to become a part of russia was this vote legitimate well it depends on who you ask for putin this was crimea's liberation for the rest of the world this was crimea's annexation the focus then shifted to eastern ukraine where russia backed separatists had seized territory ukrainian forces did not launch an all-out offensive at first but on the 17th of july 2014 when a flight carrying 298 people were shot down by these rebels ukrainian forces decided to flush out the rebels the separatists began losing ground so the russian army stepped in they invaded eastern ukraine and fought alongside the rebels what followed was a series of talks between russia ukraine and the west they resulted in the minsk accords this was first signed in 2014 both sides agreed on ceasefire and military withdrawal ukraine agreed to hold elections in the rebel-held areas eight years on the minsk accords remain unimplemented ukraine

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev. While there isn't a direct match, Question 2 mentions the historical context of the region, but it doesn't specifically ask about the transfer of Crimea.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 5, but it's not a good match because it asks about the annexation of Crimea in 2014, not the transfer in 1954.

A better approach would be to create a new generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example:

Question: In what year did Nikita Khrushchev transfer Crimea from Russia to Ukraine?
Options: A. 1950, B. 1954, C. 1960, D. 1970

This new generated MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match, and it's not possible to provide an index of a matching generated MCQ.

It’s moments after the Big Bang
and... wow, you’re still reeling. You’re a particle of matter, 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,
as with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: 
with you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on,
to reach this final set. If you map them back 
to the original circle, standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive. So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles. You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before, but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,
perform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards 
starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,
each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, 
no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, 
this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs 
reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,
representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, 
subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar. It discusses the strategy to ensure survival in the game, which is related to finding a safe spot. However, the options provided do not directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the possibility of multiple safe spots in a ring with a certain arrangement of particles. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific question.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar. It discusses the strategy for survival in the game, which is related to finding a safe spot. However, it does not directly address the question of whether four particles of matter and four particles of antimatter can arrange themselves to provide one safe place to stand.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the arrangement of particles and antimatter to provide a safe spot. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this description.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and... wow, you’re still reeling. You’re a particle of matter, 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,
as with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: 
with you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on,
to reach this final set. If you map them back 
to the original circle, standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive. So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles. You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before, but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,
perform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards 
starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,
each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, 
no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, 
this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs 
reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,
representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, 
subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks if there can be a safe spot for the particle to stand in a ring of one-million particles of matter and one-million particles of antimatter. The correct answer is "Yes".

Question 6 asks about the condition for a spot to be considered safe, and option B states "If the sum of the running total never hits 0." This is related to the concept of finding a safe spot in the ring, but it's not a direct match.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, as it deals with the concept of safe spots in the ring.

where you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before, but you have a programmable device

of cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,

Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards 
starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,
each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, 
no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, 
this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs 
reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,
representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, 
subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the context and the topic of particle annihilation, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of particles of matter that will remain at the end of the game, given a specific initial arrangement of particles. Among the generated MCQs, Question 10 is the most relevant, as it asks about the final outcome for the particle or cube that chooses a safe spot. However, the options and the specific scenario described in Question 10 do not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would suggest Question 10, but with the caveat that it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and... wow, you’re still reeling. You’re a particle of matter, 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,
as with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: 
with you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on,
to reach this final set. If you map them back 
to the original circle, standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive. So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles. You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 10 is the most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the survival of three matter particles that insert themselves in safe spots, and the correct answer is that all three will survive. Question 10 asks about the final outcome for the particle or cube that chooses a safe spot, and the correct answer is that it will be the last particle standing (although not explicitly stated, it implies survival).

While the questions are not identical, they both relate to the concept of safe spots and survival in the game. Therefore, I would identify Question 10 as the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog. Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled,
packaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began, 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought
the project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone 
San Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built; and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally
like a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers,
linked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss to pursue a different approach:
the suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, 
advanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible
due to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components
to California, reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable,
shallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor,
creating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts
between tides. The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked
the south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously,
requiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net 
below the towers. But not even these precautions 
could prevent an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete, 
workers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals,
and laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished,
but there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color 
still complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, 
and rolling fog.

packaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began, 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought
the project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone 
San Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built; and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally
like a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers,
linked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss to pursue a different approach:
the suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, 
advanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible
due to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components
to California, reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable,
shallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor,
creating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts
between tides. The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked
the south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously,
requiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net 
below the towers. But not even these precautions 
could prevent an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete, 
workers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals,
and laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished,
but there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color 
still complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, 
and rolling fog.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What type of bridge did Joseph Strauss initially plan to build across the Golden Gate Strait?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the chief engineer behind the bridge, it does mention Joseph Strauss, who is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ. The other generated MCQs do not mention the chief engineer or Joseph Strauss in a similar context.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **3**

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the completion year of the bridge, while the generated MCQs cover various other topics related to the bridge's construction, design, and history.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of the bridge's construction timeline, I would suggest Question 8, which mentions a specific event (the scaffolding platform falling) that occurred in 1937, the same year the bridge was completed. Nevertheless, this question does not directly ask about the completion year of the bridge.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Hera, queen of the gods, 
was on the edge of her throne. A mountain nymph named Echo, 
renowned for her charm and chatter, was regaling her with a sensational story. But what Hera didn’t know 
was that Echo was merely distracting her while her husband, Zeus, was frolicking about 
with the other nymphs. Unfortunately for Echo, Zeus got sloppy,
and Hera realized what was going on. Enraged by Echo’s duplicity— and powerless to stop 
her husband’s adultery— Hera decided to silence
the nymph for good. From then on, Echo could no longer
enrapture listeners with her stories; she could only repeat the last words
another said. As her conversations became dull 
and her company undesirable, Echo grew dispirited. One day, while Echo was drifting
through the woods, she spotted a young man hunting deer. It was Narcissus, the stunningly beautiful
son of a river god and water nymph. After his birth, a seer had given 
his mother a cryptic prophecy: Narcissus would live a long life—
but only if he never really knew himself. No one was sure exactly 
what to make of this. And, in the meantime,
Narcissus grew into a proud youth. His good looks attracted many admirers. But he preferred to amble through life
on his own and left a trail of broken hearts 
in his wake. Seeing Narcissus there, 
Echo was filled with longing. Unable to initiate a conversation,
she walked after him. Soon, Narcissus heard a rustle, 
and called out, “Who goes there? Who are you?” Echo revealed herself,
but only repeated the word “you,” making her tone as endearing as possible
as she went to hold him. Agitated, Narcissus said, 
“Let me go, I can’t stay.” Echo could only counter 
with a plea for him to do so. Freeing himself from her embrace,
Narcissus snapped, “I’d rather die than have you love me!” To which Echo could only cry,
“Love me... love me.” Narcissus told Echo once more 
to leave him alone, then faded from her gaze. Echo wandered to a cave. And gradually, her heart grew heavy
and her body frail until all that was left of her 
was her voice, which the wind carried to vast,
empty places. Forever after, it could be heard 
reverberating through hollow caves and rebounding across lonely clearings. But this wasn’t even the first time
heartbreak over Narcissus had proven fatal. A young man named Ameinias had also been
cruelly rejected by Narcissus. Before his death, he prayed to Nemesis,
the goddess of revenge, that Narcissus would also one day
know the pain of love. She heard Ameinias’ pleas and, 
upon witnessing Echo’s fate, decided that it would be 
the final affront. It was time for retribution. So, Nemesis set Narcissus 
towards a clear, glassy pool. As he bent towards the water to drink, he caught sight
of a hauntingly beautiful young man. Never before had Narcissus 
seen himself with such clarity. He spent the day acquainting himself
with every glinting angle and glowing curl then passed the evening 
gazing at his reflection by moonlight and sleeping with his fingers
grazing the water. Days wore on, and Narcissus never parted
from his one true love. When he reached out, 
his double reached for him; and when he leaned in to bestow a kiss,
he also tilted his face. But when he tried to hold 
the bewitching figure, it disappeared. At last, Narcissus knew the agony
of unrequited love. Eating and drinking nothing, 
Narcissus too wasted away. His neck ached from bending over the lake,
and his legs became rooted to the grass. When the wood nymphs finally passed by, all that was left of him 
was a white and yellow flower bending towards its reflection. From then on, it was known as narcissus.

**Transcript**:
Hera, queen of the gods, 
was on the edge of her throne. A mountain nymph named Echo, 
renowned for her charm and chatter, was regaling her with a sensational story. But what Hera didn’t know 
was that Echo was merely distracting her while her husband, Zeus, was frolicking about 
with the other nymphs. Unfortunately for Echo, Zeus got sloppy,
and Hera realized what was going on. Enraged by Echo’s duplicity— and powerless to stop 
her husband’s adultery— Hera decided to silence
the nymph for good. From then on, Echo could no longer
enrapture listeners with her stories; she could only repeat the last words
another said. As her conversations became dull 
and her company undesirable, Echo grew dispirited. One day, while Echo was drifting
through the woods, she spotted a young man hunting deer. It was Narcissus, the stunningly beautiful
son of a river god and water nymph. After his birth, a seer had given 
his mother a cryptic prophecy: Narcissus would live a long life—
but only if he never really knew himself. No one was sure exactly 
what to make of this. And, in the meantime,
Narcissus grew into a proud youth. His good looks attracted many admirers. But he preferred to amble through life
on his own and left a trail of broken hearts 
in his wake. Seeing Narcissus there, 
Echo was filled with longing. Unable to initiate a conversation,
she walked after him. Soon, Narcissus heard a rustle, 
and called out, “Who goes there? Who are you?” Echo revealed herself,
but only repeated the word “you,” making her tone as endearing as possible
as she went to hold him. Agitated, Narcissus said, 
“Let me go, I can’t stay.” Echo could only counter 
with a plea for him to do so. Freeing himself from her embrace,
Narcissus snapped, “I’d rather die than have you love me!” To which Echo could only cry,
“Love me... love me.” Narcissus told Echo once more 
to leave him alone, then faded from her gaze. Echo wandered to a cave. And gradually, her heart grew heavy

**Transcript**:
On April 12, 1961,
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin piloted a 2,400 kilogram spacecraft 
in humanity’s first manned space flight. One week later, Bell Aerosystems debuted
another advancement in aviation: the gas-powered rocket pack. Capable of flying 35 meters 
in just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers. But the device’s engineers
were less enthused. Despite years of cutting-edge work, they knew this short flight was all
the rocket pack could muster. So why was a massive spacecraft easier
to send flying than a single pilot? According to Newton's laws of motion, the physics behind flight are
actually quite simple. All you need is a powerful enough
upward force to counteract the downward force 
of gravity. And since objects with more mass
experience stronger gravitational forces, lighter objects should be easier
to get off the ground. However, modern jet engines,
our primary tool for flight, actually get more efficient
the larger they are. Jet engines work by sucking in huge
volumes of air, and then expelling that air
as quickly as possible. While most of this actually bypasses
the inner machinery, it still contributes to a huge portion
of the engine's thrust. But the air that does enter 
the engine’s core gets compressed by a series of tightly packed blades. That compressed air then enters
the combustion chamber, where it is injected with jet fuel
and ignited. The heat causes the compressed air 
to rapidly expand, bursting out of the exhaust 
and propelling the engine forward. As air leaves the engine it also turns 
a turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle. This turbine powers the fan
and the compressor blades, creating a cycle that maintains thrust
for as long as there’s fuel to burn. The more air an engine can take in and 
expel the more thrust it can produce. On a modern jet, the diameter 
of a frontal fan is larger than a truck. And even spinning 
at relatively low speeds, these engines produce more than enough
thrust to maintain the necessary speed for flying a passenger aircraft. But smaller engines simply can’t 
take in this much air. For most of the 20th century,
engineers couldn’t produce an engine small and light enough 
for an individual to wear, yet powerful enough to lift itself 
alongside its pilot and fuel. Designs could only carry enough fuel
for 30 seconds of flight, and when airborne, 
the powerful thrust in a single direction made jetpacks difficult
and dangerous to control. But the new millennium brought advances
in materials, manufacturing, and computing technology, including systems which could manage
fuel injection with incredible precision. Together, these dramatically improved 
the fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of jet engines. By 2016, micro-engines the size 
of a coffee can and weighing less than 2kg could achieve 220 Newtons of force. This was when an English engineer
named Richard Browning saw the opportunity to create 
a new kind of lightweight jetpack. In addition to a single engine
strapped to the back, this so-called Jet Suit involved a pair
of micro-engines on each arm to split and balance the thrust. Working with the back engine,
these provided three-points of stability, which some pilots describe as being 
akin to comfortably leaning on crutches while a friend supports your back. It may seem complicated to manage
all these engines at once, but many pilots master 
it in less than a day with the help of another 
advanced computer system— their brain. Various brain regions 
and multiple sensory systems perfectly calibrate our sense of balance 
and spatial orientation, helping pilots smoothly
direct their flights. Slight movements of the arms allow
operators to increase and decrease lift, quickly turn in mid-air, 
or glide forward for up to 5 minutes. This technology is still fairly new, and without major advances
in fuel efficiency and engine technology, don’t expect to have a jetpack
of your own any time soon. But if reaching for the sky
already got us this far, who knows where we'll fly next?

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What powers the fan and compressor blades in a jet engine? 

However, the options provided in Question 4 do not exactly match the content of the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that directly addresses the process of air in a jet engine.

A closer match would be a question that asks about the process of air in a jet engine, which is not explicitly present in the generated MCQs. However, Question 3: Why do modern jet engines become more efficient as they increase in size? mentions that modern jet engines "can take in and expel more air," which is related to the process of air in a jet engine.

Considering the options provided in the generated MCQs, none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 3, as it is the closest to discussing the process of air in a jet engine.

**Transcript**:
On April 12, 1961,
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin piloted a 2,400 kilogram spacecraft 
in humanity’s first manned space flight. One week later, Bell Aerosystems debuted
another advancement in aviation: the gas-powered rocket pack. Capable of flying 35 meters 
in just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers. But the device’s engineers
were less enthused. Despite years of cutting-edge work, they knew this short flight was all
the rocket pack could muster. So why was a massive spacecraft easier
to send flying than a single pilot? According to Newton's laws of motion, the physics behind flight are
actually quite simple. All you need is a powerful enough
upward force to counteract the downward force 
of gravity. And since objects with more mass
experience stronger gravitational forces, lighter objects should be easier
to get off the ground. However, modern jet engines,
our primary tool for flight, actually get more efficient
the larger they are. Jet engines work by sucking in huge
volumes of air, and then expelling that air
as quickly as possible. While most of this actually bypasses
the inner machinery, it still contributes to a huge portion
of the engine's thrust. But the air that does enter 
the engine’s core gets compressed by a series of tightly packed blades. That compressed air then enters
the combustion chamber, where it is injected with jet fuel
and ignited. The heat causes the compressed air 
to rapidly expand, bursting out of the exhaust 
and propelling the engine forward. As air leaves the engine it also turns 
a turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle. This turbine powers the fan
and the compressor blades, creating a cycle that maintains thrust
for as long as there’s fuel to burn. The more air an engine can take in and 
expel the more thrust it can produce. On a modern jet, the diameter 
of a frontal fan is larger than a truck. And even spinning 
at relatively low speeds, these engines produce more than enough
thrust to maintain the necessary speed for flying a passenger aircraft. But smaller engines simply can’t 
take in this much air. For most of the 20th century,
engineers couldn’t produce an engine small and light enough 
for an individual to wear, yet powerful enough to lift itself 
alongside its pilot and fuel. Designs could only carry enough fuel
for 30 seconds of flight, and when airborne, 
the powerful thrust in a single direction made jetpacks difficult
and dangerous to control. But the new millennium brought advances
in materials, manufacturing, and computing technology, including systems which could manage
fuel injection with incredible precision. Together, these dramatically improved 
the fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of jet engines. By 2016, micro-engines the size 
of a coffee can and weighing less than 2kg could achieve 220 Newtons of force. This was when an English engineer
named Richard Browning saw the opportunity to create 
a new kind of lightweight jetpack. In addition to a single engine
strapped to the back, this so-called Jet Suit involved a pair
of micro-engines on each arm to split and balance the thrust. Working with the back engine,
these provided three-points of stability, which some pilots describe as being 
akin to comfortably leaning on crutches while a friend supports your back. It may seem complicated to manage
all these engines at once, but many pilots master 
it in less than a day with the help of another 
advanced computer system— their brain. Various brain regions 
and multiple sensory systems perfectly calibrate our sense of balance 
and spatial orientation, helping pilots smoothly
direct their flights. Slight movements of the arms allow
operators to increase and decrease lift, quickly turn in mid-air, 
or glide forward for up to 5 minutes. This technology is still fairly new, and without major advances
in fuel efficiency and engine technology, don’t expect to have a jetpack
of your own any time soon. But if reaching for the sky
already got us this far, who knows where we'll fly next?

**Transcript**:
In 1945, two sculptures meant to represent
the average man and woman in the United States went on exhibit
at the American Museum of Natural History. Based on measurements taken from tens
of thousands of young men and women, they were called Norma and Normman. That same year, a contest launched
to find a living embodiment of Norma. Normal is often used as a synonym
for “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct.” By that logic, most people should fit 
the description of normal. And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women 
who participated in the contest matched Norma,
the supposedly “normal” woman. This puzzle isn’t unique 
to Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, 
so-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions 
have turned out to match almost no one. And yet, a lot of the world is constructed
around a foundation of normalcy. So what does normal actually mean—
and should we be relying on it so much? In statistics, a normal distribution 
describes  a set of values that fall along a bell curve. The average, or mean, of all the values
is at the very center, and most other values fall 
within the hump of the bell. These curves can be tall, with most values
inside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias
towards the average. What makes the distribution normal 
is that it follows this curved shape. Normal doesn’t describe a single data 
point, but a pattern of diversity. Many human traits, like height,
follow a normal distribution. Some people are very tall or very short, but most people fall close 
to the overall average. Outside of statistics, normal
often refers to an average— like the single number pulled 
from the fattest part of the bell curve— that eliminates all the nuance
of the normal distribution. Norma and Norman’s proportions
came from such averages. Applied to individuals, 
whether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely 
they hew to this average. At best, such definitions of normal 
fail to capture variation. But oftentimes, our calculations of normal
are even more flawed. Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index. BMI is a measure of weight
relative to height, with different ratios 
falling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,”
and “obese” ranges. Generally, only BMIs that correspond
to normal weight are considered healthy. But BMI is not always 
an accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight. BMI doesn’t take into account 
body fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical
activity, or blood pressure. And yet, those who fall outside
the so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing
or gaining weight will improve their health. When we apply a standard of normal
to all of humanity that’s based on data 
from a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one
point on the distribution, we’re choosing it 
from the wrong distribution. A lot of behavior science research draws
from samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, 
industrialized, rich, and democratic. These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have
an obvious link to them. Take the famed 
Muller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one 
of the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length. At least, it is if you’re
an American undergraduate. A team of anthropologists 
and psychologists found other demographic groups
were much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible 
to the illusion at all. When these limited or inaccurate
definitions of normal are used to make decisions 
that impact people’s lives, they can do real harm. Historically, such concepts of normal
have been hugely influential. The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th 
century weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, 
and even extermination of those deemed not normal. To this day, people are often targeted
and discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, 
mental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features
deemed “not normal.” But the reality is that the differences
in our bodies, minds, perceptions, and ideas about
the world around us— in short, diversity— 
is the true normal.

**Transcript**:
In 1945, two sculptures meant to represent
the average man and woman in the United States went on exhibit
at the American Museum of Natural History. Based on measurements taken from tens
of thousands of young men and women, they were called Norma and Normman. That same year, a contest launched
to find a living embodiment of Norma. Normal is often used as a synonym
for “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct.” By that logic, most people should fit 
the description of normal. And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women 
who participated in the contest matched Norma,
the supposedly “normal” woman. This puzzle isn’t unique 
to Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, 
so-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions 
have turned out to match almost no one. And yet, a lot of the world is constructed
around a foundation of normalcy. So what does normal actually mean—
and should we be relying on it so much? In statistics, a normal distribution 
describes  a set of values that fall along a bell curve. The average, or mean, of all the values
is at the very center, and most other values fall 
within the hump of the bell. These curves can be tall, with most values
inside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias
towards the average. What makes the distribution normal 
is that it follows this curved shape. Normal doesn’t describe a single data 
point, but a pattern of diversity. Many human traits, like height,
follow a normal distribution. Some people are very tall or very short, but most people fall close 
to the overall average. Outside of statistics, normal
often refers to an average— like the single number pulled 
from the fattest part of the bell curve— that eliminates all the nuance
of the normal distribution. Norma and Norman’s proportions
came from such averages. Applied to individuals, 
whether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely 
they hew to this average. At best, such definitions of normal 
fail to capture variation. But oftentimes, our calculations of normal
are even more flawed. Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index. BMI is a measure of weight
relative to height, with different ratios 
falling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,”
and “obese” ranges. Generally, only BMIs that correspond
to normal weight are considered healthy. But BMI is not always 
an accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight. BMI doesn’t take into account 
body fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical
activity, or blood pressure. And yet, those who fall outside
the so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing
or gaining weight will improve their health. When we apply a standard of normal
to all of humanity that’s based on data 
from a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one
point on the distribution, we’re choosing it 
from the wrong distribution. A lot of behavior science research draws
from samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, 
industrialized, rich, and democratic. These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have
an obvious link to them. Take the famed 
Muller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one 
of the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length. At least, it is if you’re
an American undergraduate. A team of anthropologists 
and psychologists found other demographic groups
were much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible 
to the illusion at all. When these limited or inaccurate
definitions of normal are used to make decisions 
that impact people’s lives, they can do real harm. Historically, such concepts of normal
have been hugely influential. The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th 
century weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, 
and even extermination of those deemed not normal. To this day, people are often targeted
and discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, 
mental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features
deemed “not normal.” But the reality is that the differences
in our bodies, minds, perceptions, and ideas about
the world around us— in short, diversity— 
is the true normal.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8.

The ground truth MCQ discusses the persecution and murder of groups deemed a threat to the "pure" 'Aryan race' in Nazi Germany, while Question 8 talks about the consequence of the Eugenics Movement's use of the concept of normal, which led to exclusion, violence, and even extermination of those deemed not normal. Although the context is not exactly the same, both questions deal with the harm caused by the concept of normalcy and the persecution of certain groups.

The options in Question 8 also align with the intent of the ground truth MCQ, as they discuss the consequences of using the concept of normal to justify harm against certain groups.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

**Transcript**:
It was Christmas time in Camelot 
and King Arthur was throwing a party. The entire court was invited—
save the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay— and food and drink flowed freely. But in the midst of the revelry,
the castle doors split open. A towering knight riding an emerald
steed burst into the room, stunning the court into silence. Then, in a deep bellowing voice,
he proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him
with his own axe. If they could strike him down, 
they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed
to return that blow in one year and one day. Arthur and his knights were baffled. No man could survive such a strike. The Green Knight began to mock
their leader’s hesitance, and Arthur stood to defend his honor. But as soon as he gripped the axe,
another leapt to take his place. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain,
took the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded
the grinning knight. But the moment his skull met the ground,
it began to laugh. The Green Knight collected his head 
and mounted his horse. As he rode off, his severed head
reminded Gawain of their contract and told him to seek the Green Chapel
one year hence. In the months that followed, Gawain tried
to forget this bizarre vision. But despite the strangeness
of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably. When the following winter approached,
he set out— enduring foul weather 
and beastly encounters in his quest to find 
the mysterious Green Chapel. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he saw 
a shimmering castle on the horizon. The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled
to help such an honorable guest, and informed him that the Green Chapel
was only a short ride away. They implored Gawain to rest at their home
until his meeting with the Green Knight. Thrilled at this news, Gawain happily
accepted their offer. However, in exchange 
for their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go
hunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever
he’d gained during his day at the castle. At first, Gawain was perplexed
by these strange terms. But the lord’s meaning became quite clear
the next day, when his wife tried to seduce Gawain. To rebuff the lady’s advances 
without offending her honor, Gawain allowed one kiss— which he then passed on to her husband
in exchange for a slain dear. The next day, Gawain allowed two kisses,
which he gave to the lord for a dead boar. But on the third day, the lady offered
more than just three kisses. She presented a magical sash 
that would protect Gawain from the Green Knight’s blade. Gawain accepted immediately, 
but that evening, when the lord returned, the knight offered only three kisses 
with no mention of his enchanted gift. The next morning, Gawain rode 
out to the Green Chapel— a simple mound of earth where the Green Knight 
ominously sharpened an axe. With the sash’s protection, 
Gawain approached stoically— determined to honor his agreement. He bowed his head for the deadly blow,
and with a massive swing, the Green Knight cut Gawain’s neck— inflicting nothing more
than a flesh wound. Once more, Gawain was bewildered. Why hadn’t the sash protected him? And why hadn’t the knight 
killed him? Bursting into laughter, the Green Knight 
revealed himself to be the castle’s lord, and he’d been working with Morgan Le Fay to test the honor and bravery 
of Arthur’s knights. He was impressed with Gawain’s behavior, and he’d planned to spare 
his neck entirely— until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, 
Gawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, 
his companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor. Struggling to understand 
this strange journey, it seemed to Gawain that perhaps 
the whole world was playing a game— with rules more wild and bewildering
than any man could understand.

by these strange terms. But the lord’s meaning became quite clear
the next day, when his wife tried to seduce Gawain. To rebuff the lady’s advances 
without offending her honor, Gawain allowed one kiss— which he then passed on to her husband
in exchange for a slain dear. The next day, Gawain allowed two kisses,
which he gave to the lord for a dead boar. But on the third day, the lady offered
more than just three kisses. She presented a magical sash 
that would protect Gawain from the Green Knight’s blade. Gawain accepted immediately, 
but that evening, when the lord returned, the knight offered only three kisses 
with no mention of his enchanted gift. The next morning, Gawain rode 
out to the Green Chapel— a simple mound of earth where the Green Knight 
ominously sharpened an axe. With the sash’s protection, 
Gawain approached stoically— determined to honor his agreement. He bowed his head for the deadly blow,
and with a massive swing, the Green Knight cut Gawain’s neck— inflicting nothing more
than a flesh wound. Once more, Gawain was bewildered. Why hadn’t the sash protected him? And why hadn’t the knight 
killed him? Bursting into laughter, the Green Knight 
revealed himself to be the castle’s lord, and he’d been working with Morgan Le Fay to test the honor and bravery 
of Arthur’s knights. He was impressed with Gawain’s behavior, and he’d planned to spare 
his neck entirely— until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, 
Gawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, 
his companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor. Struggling to understand 
this strange journey, it seemed to Gawain that perhaps 
the whole world was playing a game— with rules more wild and bewildering
than any man could understand.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of Gawain's stay at the shimmering castle. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 mentions Gawain's stay at the castle and his agreement with the lord.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 4 does not specifically ask about the duration of Gawain's stay.

Given the options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic, I would say Question 4 is the closest, although it's still not a good match.

Index: 4 (Note: This is a weak match and not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
It was Christmas time in Camelot 
and King Arthur was throwing a party. The entire court was invited—
save the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay— and food and drink flowed freely. But in the midst of the revelry,
the castle doors split open. A towering knight riding an emerald
steed burst into the room, stunning the court into silence. Then, in a deep bellowing voice,
he proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him
with his own axe. If they could strike him down, 
they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed
to return that blow in one year and one day. Arthur and his knights were baffled. No man could survive such a strike. The Green Knight began to mock
their leader’s hesitance, and Arthur stood to defend his honor. But as soon as he gripped the axe,
another leapt to take his place. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain,
took the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded
the grinning knight. But the moment his skull met the ground,
it began to laugh. The Green Knight collected his head 
and mounted his horse. As he rode off, his severed head
reminded Gawain of their contract and told him to seek the Green Chapel
one year hence. In the months that followed, Gawain tried
to forget this bizarre vision. But despite the strangeness
of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably. When the following winter approached,
he set out— enduring foul weather 
and beastly encounters in his quest to find 
the mysterious Green Chapel. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he saw 
a shimmering castle on the horizon. The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled
to help such an honorable guest, and informed him that the Green Chapel
was only a short ride away. They implored Gawain to rest at their home
until his meeting with the Green Knight. Thrilled at this news, Gawain happily
accepted their offer. However, in exchange 
for their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go
hunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever
he’d gained during his day at the castle. At first, Gawain was perplexed
by these strange terms. But the lord’s meaning became quite clear

Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,
and he’s turning... well... the issue 
is that you’ve forgotten. He’s older than 1, but beyond that,
he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your
forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared
a small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age
as the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count
the candles on the cake, but you're much too small
to see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made
an interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, 
you can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit
and brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see 
whether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,
in no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the 
dark you can’t tell its shape or size. You aren’t carrying anything with you,
and any marks you make will disappear. You need a strategy. How can you count the candles? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways 
to solve this problem. Let's start with the most straightforward. There’s exactly one way to mark
a location in the tunnel: the state of the candle. You can mark the first candle you reach 
by lighting it or keeping it on. If you walk forward, you’ll eventually
find another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one. The question is: how could you know which? Here’s one approach: turn it off 
and backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles 
you passed on the way there. If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop
and know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, 
continuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one 
and so on. This will work... eventually. But if the giant isn’t young,
and many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run
between now and sunrise. And you definitely don’t want to be 
in the cake when he starts digging in. So let’s look for a more 
efficient solution. How about testing a series of hypotheses
about the giant's age? Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, 
walk forward 10, switch or leave the destination 
candle off, and return. If the starting candle’s still on,
10 isn’t the answer. If it’s off, 10 could be right, 
but you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2
are also possibilities. Then you would have passed
a repeating pattern— but that could have just been
the starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles
on the way? If you turned them all on while walking 
from candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find 
would tell you the exact candle count. And if you don't hit any
extinguished candles, you'll know that the total
must be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess
and try again. To be systematic, you could increase 
your guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips 
and involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles. But you don’t have to increase
your guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, 
from 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number 
on your 5th trip after around 560 candles. Doubling allows you to reach
high numbers quickly, while starting with small intervals 
in case there are only a few candles. After expecting a lengthy trek, you’re pleased to discover 
the giant is only turning 12. You hurry to change into slightly
more inconspicuous clothing; chisel up some enormous chocolate numbers;
and at the party, make your own wish: that you’re not downwind when your friend 
blows out his candles.

Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,
and he’s turning... well... the issue

he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your
forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared
a small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age
as the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count
the candles on the cake, but you're much too small
to see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made
an interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, 
you can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit
and brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see 
whether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,
in no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "Why do you need to know the giant's age in such a rush?" The correct answer is "D. All of the above," which implies that the narrator needs to know the giant's age quickly because they don't want the giant to know they've forgotten it, the birthday party is tomorrow, and they're responsible for sculpting the number in chocolate.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent. However, the options and content do not match. Question 1 asks, "What is the main problem the narrator is trying to solve?" While this question is related to the ground truth MCQ, it does not capture the specific reason why the narrator needs to know the giant's age quickly.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ. However, if I had to choose the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1.

Although Question 3 does not directly ask about the starting pattern of the candles, it does ask about the narrator's initial strategy for counting the candles, which involves interacting with the candles in the tunnel. The correct answer to Question 3 (Option A) mentions marking the first candle, which implies that the candles are not all on or all off, but rather in some unknown pattern.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: Question 3.

**Transcript**:
Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,
and he’s turning... well... the issue 
is that you’ve forgotten. He’s older than 1, but beyond that,
he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your
forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared
a small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age
as the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count
the candles on the cake, but you're much too small
to see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made
an interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, 
you can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit
and brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see 
whether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,
in no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the 
dark you can’t tell its shape or size. You aren’t carrying anything with you,
and any marks you make will disappear. You need a strategy. How can you count the candles? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways 
to solve this problem. Let's start with the most straightforward. There’s exactly one way to mark
a location in the tunnel: the state of the candle. You can mark the first candle you reach 
by lighting it or keeping it on. If you walk forward, you’ll eventually
find another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one. The question is: how could you know which? Here’s one approach: turn it off 
and backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles 
you passed on the way there. If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop
and know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, 
continuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one 
and so on. This will work... eventually. But if the giant isn’t young,
and many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run
between now and sunrise. And you definitely don’t want to be 
in the cake when he starts digging in. So let’s look for a more 
efficient solution. How about testing a series of hypotheses
about the giant's age? Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, 
walk forward 10, switch or leave the destination 
candle off, and return. If the starting candle’s still on,
10 isn’t the answer. If it’s off, 10 could be right, 
but you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2
are also possibilities. Then you would have passed
a repeating pattern— but that could have just been
the starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles
on the way? If you turned them all on while walking 
from candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find 
would tell you the exact candle count. And if you don't hit any
extinguished candles, you'll know that the total
must be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess
and try again. To be systematic, you could increase 
your guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips 
and involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles. But you don’t have to increase
your guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, 
from 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number 
on your 5th trip after around 560 candles. Doubling allows you to reach
high numbers quickly, while starting with small intervals 
in case there are only a few candles. After expecting a lengthy trek, you’re pleased to discover 
the giant is only turning 12. You hurry to change into slightly
more inconspicuous clothing; chisel up some enormous chocolate numbers;
and at the party, make your own wish: that you’re not downwind when your friend 
blows out his candles.

**Transcript**:
Peering into the eyes 
of different animals, you’ll see some extraordinarily
shaped pupils. But why? It turns out that pupil shape 
is a powerful indicator of what role an animal plays 
in its ecosystem. Pupils mark the hollow opening
in the iris, the eye’s band of pigmented muscle. They’re the portholes through which
light enters the eye, where it then strikes the retina 
and activates light-sensitive cells, setting the process of vision in motion. Pupils are black because most of the
light that enters them is absorbed. Their size changes in response
to brightness, as well as certain drugs 
and emotional and mental states— but their basic form varies greatly
among species. House cats, for one, are twilight hunters 
with vertically elongated pupils. In the dark, these structures
expand dramatically, taking in the available light. When it’s bright, they shrink into slits. In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that
their maximum area is 135 times greater than their minimum area— whereas our pupils only shrink
and expand 15-fold. And because of how the slit pupil 
takes in light, it creates sharp, vertical contours. When the cat’s brain processes 
the visuals from each eye, the small but sharp differences 
between them help the cat judge 
the precise distance of its target. In fact, many other ambush hunters also
have vertically elongated pupils— but mainly those whose eyes are
located closer to the ground. This may be because these pupils are
especially useful in perceiving objects at the relative short distances
these animals tend to hunt. The world looks very different from behind
the horizontally elongated pupils of many grazing and browsing animals, 
like goats. These pupils, situated 
on either side of the head, let horizontal bands of light in that
give the goat a near-360-degree view and provide it with sharp,
horizontal images. This helps goats detect any
disruption to the horizon— alerting them to potential predators— 
while still enabling them to see ahead and detect obstacles 
as they make their escape. In fact, goats always keep their pupils
aligned with the horizon, rotating their eyeballs in their sockets
as they move their heads up and down. Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils
that shrink into slits studded with pinholes 
in higher light conditions. Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp
image onto the geckos retina. Scientists think that comparing 
these different inputs might help the gecko judge distance
without having to move. And while they might have fooled you, mantises and other insects and crustaceans
have “pseudopupils.” These aren’t optical structures; they’re optical illusions 
experienced by the observer. Mantises have compound eyes composed
of thousands of light-sensing units. When some are aimed at you,
they appear black because they’re absorbing most wavelengths
of incoming light— but there’s no actual opening. So, why do we have round pupils? Elongated pupils help sharpen certain
dimensions of an animal's vision. But scientists think that, for animals
like us with circular pupils, this is a lower priority. Instead of seeing some elements 
of a scene in extreme focus, we see a larger picture 
in relative detail, which enables more general skills 
of observation. This may be especially helpful
for foragers looking for food, hunters eyeballing and chasing
their prey, and social animals recognizing 
other faces. As we peer at different pupils, 
patterns emerge. And yet there are exceptions. For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses
are both small ambush predators, but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils
and mongooses have goat-like pupils. And we’ve only explored
a few pupil shapes. Other animals have crescent-
or heart-shaped pupils. And the cuttlefish has perhaps
some of the most bizarre: their pupils are circular in the dark,
but W-shaped in the light. So, what’s going on here? Well, wouldn’t we all like to know?

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the typical pupil shape of ambush hunters.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will choose the closest related question. 

 Question 2: Why do house cats have vertically elongated pupils? Options: A. To see in complete darkness, B. To detect objects at long distances, C. To take in available light during twilight hours and judge distances accurately, D. To perceive a wider range of colors 

However, the best match is actually none of the questions because none directly asks about the typical pupil shape of ambush hunters.

But if we were to choose the closest match based on the information given in the questions, it would be Question 2, which talks about the vertically elongated pupils of house cats, which are also ambush hunters.

However, I noticed that Question 8 has an option that directly mentions the pupil shape of ambush predators, which makes it somewhat relevant.

 Question 8: What is an exception to the pattern of pupil shapes in animals? Options: A. Pallas's cats have vertically elongated pupils, B. Mongooses have round pupils, C. Pallas's cats have round pupils, while mongooses have goat-like pupils, D. All ambush predators have vertically elongated pupils 

So in the context of the given questions and based on the closest match to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 8, option D is the closest match to the ground truth MCQ, even though the question itself is phrased differently.

However, if I had to pick one of the questions as it is, without considering the options, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Peering into the eyes 
of different animals, you’ll see some extraordinarily
shaped pupils. But why? It turns out that pupil shape 
is a powerful indicator of what role an animal plays 
in its ecosystem. Pupils mark the hollow opening
in the iris, the eye’s band of pigmented muscle. They’re the portholes through which
light enters the eye, where it then strikes the retina 
and activates light-sensitive cells, setting the process of vision in motion. Pupils are black because most of the
light that enters them is absorbed. Their size changes in response
to brightness, as well as certain drugs 
and emotional and mental states— but their basic form varies greatly
among species. House cats, for one, are twilight hunters 
with vertically elongated pupils. In the dark, these structures
expand dramatically, taking in the available light. When it’s bright, they shrink into slits. In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that
their maximum area is 135 times greater than their minimum area— whereas our pupils only shrink
and expand 15-fold. And because of how the slit pupil 
takes in light, it creates sharp, vertical contours. When the cat’s brain processes 
the visuals from each eye, the small but sharp differences 
between them help the cat judge 
the precise distance of its target. In fact, many other ambush hunters also
have vertically elongated pupils— but mainly those whose eyes are
located closer to the ground. This may be because these pupils are
especially useful in perceiving objects at the relative short distances
these animals tend to hunt. The world looks very different from behind
the horizontally elongated pupils of many grazing and browsing animals, 
like goats. These pupils, situated 
on either side of the head, let horizontal bands of light in that
give the goat a near-360-degree view and provide it with sharp,
horizontal images. This helps goats detect any
disruption to the horizon— alerting them to potential predators— 
while still enabling them to see ahead and detect obstacles 
as they make their escape. In fact, goats always keep their pupils
aligned with the horizon, rotating their eyeballs in their sockets
as they move their heads up and down. Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils
that shrink into slits studded with pinholes 
in higher light conditions. Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp
image onto the geckos retina. Scientists think that comparing 
these different inputs might help the gecko judge distance
without having to move. And while they might have fooled you, mantises and other insects and crustaceans
have “pseudopupils.” These aren’t optical structures; they’re optical illusions 
experienced by the observer. Mantises have compound eyes composed
of thousands of light-sensing units. When some are aimed at you,
they appear black because they’re absorbing most wavelengths
of incoming light— but there’s no actual opening. So, why do we have round pupils? Elongated pupils help sharpen certain
dimensions of an animal's vision. But scientists think that, for animals
like us with circular pupils, this is a lower priority. Instead of seeing some elements 
of a scene in extreme focus, we see a larger picture 
in relative detail, which enables more general skills 
of observation. This may be especially helpful
for foragers looking for food, hunters eyeballing and chasing
their prey, and social animals recognizing 
other faces. As we peer at different pupils, 
patterns emerge. And yet there are exceptions. For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses
are both small ambush predators, but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils
and mongooses have goat-like pupils. And we’ve only explored
a few pupil shapes. Other animals have crescent-
or heart-shaped pupils. And the cuttlefish has perhaps
some of the most bizarre: their pupils are circular in the dark,
but W-shaped in the light. So, what’s going on here? Well, wouldn’t we all like to know?

**Transcript**:
In the celestial court of the Jade Emperor
lived seven princesses. Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess
had a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky
and spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye
could find a seam. But her craft was the same day after day,
and she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted 
the weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister 
from earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them
to fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe 
of the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim
in one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,
she dreamt about staying forever. Meanwhile, a lone cowherd
approached the riverbank. He came here often
to sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently 
to the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,
the cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,
his lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's
plight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s 
celestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain 
if she lost her ticket back to Heaven. As the cowherd approached,
the princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment 
as a substitute. And after gaining her trust, 
the pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see 
the world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had
fallen deeply in love. The weaver and the cowherd
built a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver 
taught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was 
blessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored
the family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned
to her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,
she decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver
swept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized
that barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth
was merely a day in Heaven. When her family learned of her new life,
they were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked 
a golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river
of stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also
remembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt
over his back and hurtled upwards. Above the clouds, each lover attempted
to wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them
only grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother
watched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver 
and the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies 
to cheer them on. Finally, their love moved
the Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive
her granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver
to meet her earthly family once a year. And so, in late summer, the magpies
form a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people
in East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these 
star-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion.

celestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain 
if she lost her ticket back to Heaven. As the cowherd approached,
the princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment 
as a substitute. And after gaining her trust, 
the pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see 
the world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had
fallen deeply in love. The weaver and the cowherd
built a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver 
taught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was 
blessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored
the family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned
to her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,
she decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver
swept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized
that barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth
was merely a day in Heaven. When her family learned of her new life,
they were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked 
a golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river
of stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also
remembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt
over his back and hurtled upwards. Above the clouds, each lover attempted
to wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them
only grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother
watched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver 
and the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies 
to cheer them on. Finally, their love moved
the Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive
her granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver
to meet her earthly family once a year. And so, in late summer, the magpies
form a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people
in East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these 
star-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion.

**Transcript**:
In the celestial court of the Jade Emperor
lived seven princesses. Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess
had a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky
and spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye
could find a seam. But her craft was the same day after day,
and she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted 
the weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister 
from earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them
to fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe 
of the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim
in one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,
she dreamt about staying forever. Meanwhile, a lone cowherd
approached the riverbank. He came here often
to sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently 
to the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,
the cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,
his lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's
plight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s

**Transcript**:
As Numberland’s best detective,
you thought you’d seen it all. But the desiccated corpses 
of prominent natural numbers— whole numbers greater than 0— have been showing up all over the city
for the past week. All of Digitopolis is on lockdown
from sundown to sunrise, and it’s still not enough to stop
what can only be described as a vampiric feeding frenzy. The police are helpless, 
and have turned to you. You put the missing persons case 
you’ve been investigating on hold and study the evidence. Here’s what you know: most victims have been completely
drained of their life’s essence. Some have a thin line of slime
separating digits— some of which were drained 
and others spared. Which leads you to mystery one: what’s the significance 
of the slime-lines, and why are certain digits untouched? Pause here to figure it out yourself. 
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s start by looking 
for a pattern in the victims. Why have some been fully drained,
and some slimed? Well, the slime-lined are in their prime— which is to say they’re prime numbers,
divisible only by 1 and themselves. Not a single one of the unslimed numbers,
on the other hand, is. Furthermore, the drained parts of the 
slimed primes are not, themselves, prime. When 71 got slimed, 7 was prime,
but 1 was not. If 461 had been split into 4 and 61,
the right side would have been prime, but instead it was split further
into non-prime digits. And when 2099 got slimed, 
the attacker went with 20 and 99, and was able to drain both. So you have a big problem. There are infinite potential victims: all non-prime numbers, and all prime numbers that can 
be slime-lined to reveal at least one non-prime number. In fact, you can only think of a few
numbers that aren't vulnerable. First of all, the one digit primes: 
2, 3, 5, and 7. Then primes like 23, which could only be
split into 2 and 3, both prime. These numbers are familiar, but why? Aha! Your missing person’s case. Someone is kidnapping the numbers
that can’t be drained: we’ll call them the immune. If you can identify the four immune 
who remain, perhaps you can get to them first
and figure out what’s going on. Who are the immune?
Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are 4 one-digit immune:
2, 3, 5, and 7. All have already been kidnapped. But every digit in all of the immune
must be one of those four numbers; otherwise there would be 
a non-prime split possible. That means there are only these 16
candidates among the two-digit numbers. The ones that are prime must be immune. We can eliminate anything 
that ends in 2 or 5, as they’ll always be divisible by 2 and 5. This diagonal is also out,
as they’re divisible by 11. If the digits of a number add
up to a multiple of 3, it’s divisible by 3. So that eliminates 57 and 27,
leaving these numbers. Which, upon double-checking, are, 
in fact, immune. We now have a strong starting point
for searching three-digit numbers: any 2 consecutive digits must be 
on the list of the two-digit immune. Those all end in 3 and 7, so the only possibilities
are these 8 options: the two-digit immune with additional
3s or 7s on their ends. 3 can’t follow 3,
nor 7 follow 7. And once again, adding the digits 
reveals that 237 and 537 are divisible by 3. 737 is 67 times 11, 
so that leaves just 373, which is, in fact, prime,
and therefore immune. Could a four-digit number be immune? No, any consecutive three digits
would have to be immune, and there’s no immune three digit
number that starts with a 7. You rush out, 
but reach each home too late, until the only immune left is 373. You’re in the nick of time to scare
off her would-be kidnapper; not the vampire itself but a minion. 373 explains that she and the other immune
are the subjects of an ancient prophecy that designated them as vampire slayers. They’d sometimes gather and try 
to figure out what a vampire is, but no one had the slightest idea. They found the idea of slaying
things quite distasteful. You both trail her would-be kidnapper
back to a foreboding castle. There you release the other 
kidnapped numbers and confront the vampire himself. He’s powerless before the slayers, 
but ever the pacifists, they round him up, return the lifeforce 
to his victims, and send him packing. Numberland is safe... for now.

**Transcript**:
As Numberland’s best detective,
you thought you’d seen it all. But the desiccated corpses 
of prominent natural numbers— whole numbers greater than 0— have been showing up all over the city
for the past week. All of Digitopolis is on lockdown
from sundown to sunrise, and it’s still not enough to stop
what can only be described as a vampiric feeding frenzy. The police are helpless, 
and have turned to you. You put the missing persons case 
you’ve been investigating on hold and study the evidence. Here’s what you know: most victims have been completely
drained of their life’s essence. Some have a thin line of slime
separating digits— some of which were drained 
and others spared. Which leads you to mystery one: what’s the significance 
of the slime-lines, and why are certain digits untouched? Pause here to figure it out yourself. 
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s start by looking 
for a pattern in the victims. Why have some been fully drained,
and some slimed? Well, the slime-lined are in their prime— which is to say they’re prime numbers,
divisible only by 1 and themselves. Not a single one of the unslimed numbers,
on the other hand, is. Furthermore, the drained parts of the 
slimed primes are not, themselves, prime. When 71 got slimed, 7 was prime,
but 1 was not. If 461 had been split into 4 and 61,
the right side would have been prime, but instead it was split further
into non-prime digits. And when 2099 got slimed, 
the attacker went with 20 and 99, and was able to drain both. So you have a big problem. There are infinite potential victims: all non-prime numbers, and all prime numbers that can 
be slime-lined to reveal at least one non-prime number. In fact, you can only think of a few
numbers that aren't vulnerable. First of all, the one digit primes: 
2, 3, 5, and 7. Then primes like 23, which could only be
split into 2 and 3, both prime. These numbers are familiar, but why? Aha! Your missing person’s case. Someone is kidnapping the numbers
that can’t be drained: we’ll call them the immune. If you can identify the four immune 
who remain, perhaps you can get to them first
and figure out what’s going on. Who are the immune?
Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are 4 one-digit immune:
2, 3, 5, and 7. All have already been kidnapped. But every digit in all of the immune
must be one of those four numbers; otherwise there would be 
a non-prime split possible. That means there are only these 16
candidates among the two-digit numbers. The ones that are prime must be immune. We can eliminate anything 
that ends in 2 or 5, as they’ll always be divisible by 2 and 5. This diagonal is also out,
as they’re divisible by 11. If the digits of a number add
up to a multiple of 3, it’s divisible by 3. So that eliminates 57 and 27,
leaving these numbers. Which, upon double-checking, are, 
in fact, immune. We now have a strong starting point
for searching three-digit numbers: any 2 consecutive digits must be 
on the list of the two-digit immune. Those all end in 3 and 7, so the only possibilities
are these 8 options: the two-digit immune with additional
3s or 7s on their ends. 3 can’t follow 3,
nor 7 follow 7. And once again, adding the digits 
reveals that 237 and 537 are divisible by 3. 737 is 67 times 11, 
so that leaves just 373, which is, in fact, prime,
and therefore immune. Could a four-digit number be immune? No, any consecutive three digits
would have to be immune, and there’s no immune three digit
number that starts with a 7. You rush out, 
but reach each home too late, until the only immune left is 373. You’re in the nick of time to scare

**Transcript**:
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead,
there’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, 
O vile cockroach.” More than 3,000 years later, 
we’re still trying to oust these insects. But from poison traps 
to hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather 
just about everything we throw at them. So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill? There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species. 99% of them live in a range of habitats
where they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying 
organic matter and nourishing other animals. But a couple dozen species adapted to live
in close association with humans. German and American cockroaches
are among the most common. And they owe their resilience
to a combination of physical and chemical adaptations. When it comes to old-fashioned 
removal methods, they're troublingly tenacious. An American cockroach’s sensory hairs 
or structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals 
to its central nervous system. The roach can then turn and sprint
away within a few milliseconds. And it’s among the fastest invertebrates
ever recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50
body lengths per second. This would be the human equivalent of
running more than 300 kilometers per hour. And finding a hiding place is no problem. With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into 
spaces less than a quarter of its height. Even if we do land a hit, 
it can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight 
by distributing the impact along its body. And the cockroach’s toughness
doesn’t end there. Cockroaches can eat a variety 
of organic matter, including hair, dead skin, 
adhesives, and paper. This is made possible by an expansive set 
of digestive enzymes. Cockroaches are able to thrive 
even in nutrient-poor environments. Roaches often eat decaying foods
that are low in nitrogen— an essential component
of DNA and proteins. But they survive by storing 
nitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group
of bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them. Meanwhile, German cockroaches
will eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members 
without hesitation. An American cockroach will
frolic in sewers, consuming excrement and toting microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli. But they’ll rarely suffer
any consequences. This is because they’re equipped 
with genes that provide immunity against numerous pathogens. These genes are often duplicated 
many times over. So when infected, the cockroach’s 
immune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules. Cockroaches also have a slew of defenses
against pesticides. When a non-resistant roach walks 
on a surface that’s been sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide, 
for example, the results will likely be fatal. Once absorbed, the chemical binds
to sodium channel proteins, which help propagate nerve impulses. The pyrethroid keeps 
the sodium channels open, so the nerves fire repeatedly. And soon, the cockroach dies. But if a resistant roach is exposed 
to pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine. Genetic mutations have given
them sodium channels that the pyrethroids can’t bind to. The cockroach also produces more
detoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes 
it as a waste. Because German cockroaches
reproduce especially quickly, populations may evolve resistance 
to a new pesticide within months. So far, they're already resistant
to 43 different chemicals. But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive 
a nuclear apocalypse. Compared with other insects, cockroaches are only mildly

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead,
there’s a banishment spell that declares, “Be far from me, 
O vile cockroach.” More than 3,000 years later, 
we’re still trying to oust these insects. But from poison traps 
to hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather 
just about everything we throw at them. So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill? There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species. 99% of them live in a range of habitats
where they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying 
organic matter and nourishing other animals. But a couple dozen species adapted to live
in close association with humans. German and American cockroaches
are among the most common. And they owe their resilience
to a combination of physical and chemical adaptations. When it comes to old-fashioned 
removal methods, they're troublingly tenacious. An American cockroach’s sensory hairs 
or structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals 
to its central nervous system. The roach can then turn and sprint
away within a few milliseconds. And it’s among the fastest invertebrates
ever recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50
body lengths per second. This would be the human equivalent of
running more than 300 kilometers per hour. And finding a hiding place is no problem. With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into 
spaces less than a quarter of its height. Even if we do land a hit, 
it can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight 
by distributing the impact along its body. And the cockroach’s toughness
doesn’t end there. Cockroaches can eat a variety 
of organic matter, including hair, dead skin, 
adhesives, and paper. This is made possible by an expansive set 
of digestive enzymes. Cockroaches are able to thrive 
even in nutrient-poor environments. Roaches often eat decaying foods
that are low in nitrogen— an essential component
of DNA and proteins. But they survive by storing 
nitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group
of bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them. Meanwhile, German cockroaches
will eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members 
without hesitation. An American cockroach will
frolic in sewers, consuming excrement and toting microbes
like Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli. But they’ll rarely suffer
any consequences. This is because they’re equipped 
with genes that provide immunity against numerous pathogens. These genes are often duplicated 
many times over. So when infected, the cockroach’s 
immune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules. Cockroaches also have a slew of defenses
against pesticides. When a non-resistant roach walks 
on a surface that’s been sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide, 
for example, the results will likely be fatal. Once absorbed, the chemical binds
to sodium channel proteins, which help propagate nerve impulses. The pyrethroid keeps 
the sodium channels open, so the nerves fire repeatedly. And soon, the cockroach dies. But if a resistant roach is exposed 
to pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine. Genetic mutations have given
them sodium channels that the pyrethroids can’t bind to. The cockroach also produces more
detoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes 
it as a waste. Because German cockroaches
reproduce especially quickly, populations may evolve resistance 
to a new pesticide within months. So far, they're already resistant
to 43 different chemicals. But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive 
a nuclear apocalypse. Compared with other insects, cockroaches are only mildly
tolerant to radiation. They would die near the sites
of nuclear explosions and would still be severely
compromised miles away. Moreover, disasters that threaten humanity also jeopardize the habitats and buffets 
we provide roaches. Perhaps the only way to beat them 
is through our mutual destruction. Or maybe cockroaches would find 
even more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone.

**Transcript**:
Every year before the ancient Greeks
sowed their seeds of grain, they celebrated Demeter, 
the goddess of agriculture. On Earth, each morsel of food 
was sweet sustenance, while in the land of the dead,
it ensured a permanent stay. Demeter tended to Earth’s fields 
with her beloved daughter, Persephone, who inherited her mother’s passions
and grew into a bright young woman. But all the while, a shadowy figure
watched from below. One day, Persephone was frolicking
in a meadow with a freshwater nymph, Cyane. As they admired a blooming
narcissus flower, they noticed it tremble in the ground. Suddenly, the earth split, 
and a terrifying figure arose. It was Hades, god of the dead
and the underworld. He wrenched Persephone from Cyane,
dragged her into his inky chariot, and blasted back through the earth. Cyane wept so hard she dissolved,
becoming one with the river. By the time Demeter arrived 
at the scene of the abduction, the crater in the meadow had closed—
and Cyane and Persephone had vanished. Demeter sped to Mount Olympus for help. Many of the gods had witnessed the scene. And they knew about the deal 
that paved the way for it: Zeus, Persephone’s father, 
had granted Hades her hand in marriage without her consent— or Demeter’s. But when faced with Demeter’s pleas, 
the other gods stayed silent, So, she searched alone. In her grief and desperation, 
she neglected her usual tasks. Crops withered, and a great famine 
plagued the Earth. As mortals began to perish, 
the gods grew wary. Who would worship them and 
offer tributes if the humans disappeared? So, Zeus ordered Demeter to stop 
her crusade and returned to her duties. But she refused. Deep below, across the frigid river Styx,
and through the halls of the underworld, Persephone was waging her own protest. Hades expected her to serve
as his wife and queen. But Persephone rebuffed the god’s advances
and refused food. As she longed for her mother’s company, her friends’ laughter,
and the sun’s warmth, Persephone grew colder and lonelier. And she was starving. She hungered for satisfying grains,
crisp vegetables and fresh fruit. Wandering the ghostly gardens, she contemplated the pomegranates 
that hung heavily on their branches... Meanwhile, Demeter continued her hunt. She appealed to the all-seeing sun god,
Helios, whose rays had long warmed her crops. Indeed, when Helios drew his golden
chariot across the sky that fateful day, he saw what happened— 
and he knew of the deal. Out of respect and sympathy for Demeter, Helios told her of Hades’ demands,
Zeus’ betrayal and Persephone’s abduction. Furious and heartbroken, Demeter sped
to Mount Olympus and confronted Zeus, demanding their daughter’s return. But Zeus declined: in her ravenous hunger, Persephone had eaten a few seeds from the 
pomegranate that grew in the underworld. Though a meager amount, it was enough
to ensnare her in Hades forever. Demeter wouldn't accept this fate. She swore that if she wasn’t
reunited with Persephone, the fields would never be fertile again, and the distinction between the Earth 
and the underworld would soon dissolve. So, they made a pact. For two thirds of every year, Persephone 
would return to the land of the living, But for the remainder, she would stay 
in the world of the dead. When Persephone ascended to Earth,
she and her mother rejoiced. Together, they showered the fields 
with rain and nurtured them with sun. For mortals, Persephone’s arrival came
to herald the start of spring. But her descent always came too soon. Each time she returned to Hades, 
Demeter mourned, and the earth grew cold, 
dark, and unyielding, ushering in the winter months. Knowing Demeter couldn’t be roused 
from her grief, the humans stored their crops, 
stoked their fires, and awaited Persephone’s safe return. And so it was that her transit marked
the gradual turning of the seasons and the bittersweet compromise
between life and death.

Every year before the ancient Greeks
sowed their seeds of grain, they celebrated Demeter, 
the goddess of agriculture. On Earth, each morsel of food 
was sweet sustenance, while in the land of the dead,
it ensured a permanent stay. Demeter tended to Earth’s fields 
with her beloved daughter, Persephone, who inherited her mother’s passions
and grew into a bright young woman. But all the while, a shadowy figure
watched from below. One day, Persephone was frolicking
in a meadow with a freshwater nymph, Cyane. As they admired a blooming
narcissus flower, they noticed it tremble in the ground. Suddenly, the earth split, 
and a terrifying figure arose. It was Hades, god of the dead
and the underworld. He wrenched Persephone from Cyane,
dragged her into his inky chariot, and blasted back through the earth. Cyane wept so hard she dissolved,
becoming one with the river. By the time Demeter arrived 
at the scene of the abduction, the crater in the meadow had closed—
and Cyane and Persephone had vanished. Demeter sped to Mount Olympus for help. Many of the gods had witnessed the scene. And they knew about the deal 
that paved the way for it: Zeus, Persephone’s father, 
had granted Hades her hand in marriage without her consent— or Demeter’s. But when faced with Demeter’s pleas,

Helios, whose rays had long warmed her crops. Indeed, when Helios drew his golden
chariot across the sky that fateful day, he saw what happened— 
and he knew of the deal. Out of respect and sympathy for Demeter, Helios told her of Hades’ demands,
Zeus’ betrayal and Persephone’s abduction. Furious and heartbroken, Demeter sped
to Mount Olympus and confronted Zeus, demanding their daughter’s return. But Zeus declined: in her ravenous hunger, Persephone had eaten a few seeds from the 
pomegranate that grew in the underworld. Though a meager amount, it was enough
to ensnare her in Hades forever. Demeter wouldn't accept this fate. She swore that if she wasn’t
reunited with Persephone, the fields would never be fertile again, and the distinction between the Earth 
and the underworld would soon dissolve. So, they made a pact. For two thirds of every year, Persephone 
would return to the land of the living, But for the remainder, she would stay 
in the world of the dead. When Persephone ascended to Earth,
she and her mother rejoiced. Together, they showered the fields 
with rain and nurtured them with sun. For mortals, Persephone’s arrival came
to herald the start of spring. But her descent always came too soon. Each time she returned to Hades, 
Demeter mourned, and the earth grew cold, 
dark, and unyielding, ushering in the winter months. Knowing Demeter couldn’t be roused 
from her grief, the humans stored their crops, 
stoked their fires, and awaited Persephone’s safe return. And so it was that her transit marked
the gradual turning of the seasons and the bittersweet compromise
between life and death.

**Transcript**:
You’re sitting on the couch watching TV,
when you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived 
to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has
always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing
a grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,
“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence 
against them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would
believe in this situation. This dilemma is part of what philosophers
call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores 
how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties
to believe certain things. The question here isn't about
what you should do, such as whether or not you should find
your spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury
in their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe
to be true. So, what factors should you consider? Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something
is to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps
us determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw
the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought 
to determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,
and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused 
is your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence 
from a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective 
of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character
is a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints 
at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe 
your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. Some philosophers present
evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century 
evidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence
is also morally required. One argument for this view is that 
having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining 
the ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something
unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is 
a way of being dishonest with oneself. However, perhaps there are other
ethical factors in play. Although the evidence against
your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that
they’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how 
it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—
not even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting
them in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack 
of trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult 
to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—
or even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe
that your spouse is innocent, but could you really 
go on living that lie? According to a theory of the ethics 
of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations
can sometimes make it right to believe something
even without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say 
that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. But is it even possible to believe
your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good
for your relationship? Or because you think you owe
it to the accused? You might desperately want 
to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the
same way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe
whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, 
recall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible
to control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? 
Can you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe
about your spouse?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re sitting on the couch watching TV,
when you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived 
to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has
always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing
a grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,
“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence 
against them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would
believe in this situation. This dilemma is part of what philosophers
call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores 
how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties
to believe certain things. The question here isn't about
what you should do, such as whether or not you should find
your spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury
in their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe
to be true. So, what factors should you consider? Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something
is to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps
us determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw
the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought 
to determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,
and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused 
is your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence 
from a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective 
of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character
is a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints 
at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe 
your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. Some philosophers present
evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century 
evidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence
is also morally required. One argument for this view is that 
having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining 
the ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something
unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is 
a way of being dishonest with oneself. However, perhaps there are other
ethical factors in play. Although the evidence against
your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that
they’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how 
it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—
not even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting
them in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack 
of trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult 
to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—
or even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe
that your spouse is innocent, but could you really 
go on living that lie? According to a theory of the ethics 
of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations
can sometimes make it right to believe something
even without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say 
that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. But is it even possible to believe
your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good
for your relationship? Or because you think you owe
it to the accused? You might desperately want 
to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the
same way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe
whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, 
recall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible
to control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? 
Can you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe
about your spouse?

**Transcript**:
We get it, not everyone loves snakes. You may not want to encounter one
in the wild. To each their own! That’s why we’re here, 
to take you on a world tour of some of nature’s most incredible snakes
from the safety of your home— and with your very own intrepid guide. All the snakes we’ll be visiting
belong to a group called the vipers. As of 2021, there are 368 species
of viper worldwide. The name comes from the term viviparity,
which means giving birth to live young. Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, most vipers have eggs 
that hatch inside the mother, who then gives birth 
to up to dozens of tiny snakes. Not glad you’re safe at home yet? Vipers are also often highly venomous, with two hollow fangs that fold flat
to the roofs of their mouths. This allows the fangs to be extra long, unfolding into imposing weapons
when the viper prepares to strike. So how about we pay them a surprise visit? First stop: 
the southeastern United States, where we can hear the viper
before we can see it. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is
the largest of 36 species of rattlesnake. Rattlesnakes can shake their rattles
up to 90 times per second to warn off predators 
for hours if needed. The rattle consists of hollow, interlocked
segments made of keratin, the same substance that makes
our nails and hair. When the snake shakes its tail,
these segments hit each other, creating a shockingly loud noise. Now onto the mountains of western Iran,
where a spider crawls across a rock, making easy prey for a passing bird—
or not. The spider-tailed horned viper is
perfectly camouflaged, almost invisible, except for its unique bulbous tail-tip
with long drooping scales that look like a leggy spider. Spider-tailed vipers
are only about 50 centimeters long, so they can lure small birds 
within striking range without compromising their ability 
to squeeze into narrow rock crevices. In the rainforests of Latin America 
lives a viper that couldn’t be more different
from the spider-tailed viper— if you can find it. It’s one of the most elusive snakes
in the world: the bushmaster. The bushmaster is a pit viper. Between each eye and nostril,
it has a heat-sensing pit with a membrane covered 
in highly sensitive receptors that respond to temperature changes as small as one one-thousandth 
of a degree Celsius. These pits gather infrared information
that is integrated with visual information in the optic tectum. This allows the bushmaster to “see” 
the heat signature of approaching prey or predators, helping it decide whether or not to strike
and strike more accurately. This comes in handy for guarding a nest— unlike most other vipers, 
the bushmaster lays eggs in hollowed out tree buttresses 
or burrows made by other animals. It must be large enough
to defend its nest— in fact, the bushmaster is the
largest viper in the world, reaching lengths of over 11 feet,
with huge fangs and deadly venom. Meanwhile, in the forests 
of sub-Saharan Africa, there’s a shorter, chunkier viper that’s 
even more venomous than the bushmaster. The African Gaboon viper has 
the longest fangs of any snake— yes, all 3,879 snake species, 
not just vipers— and can deliver 1,000 milligrams
of venom in a single bite— enough to kill ten adult humans. Although deadly, Gaboon vipers 
have a reputation for being slow-moving 
and placid creatures. When they do strike, they hold onto their 
rodent prey while the venom takes effect, then quickly swallow it down. At this point, you may be worrying
about our guide— but never fear, rodents like our little desert 
kangaroo rat have their own skills to evade the serpent’s tooth. They stomp their feet at rattlesnakes,
kick sand towards them, and evade their strikes 
with acrobatic leaps and powerful kicks— helping them live to guide 
another snake tour.

**Transcript**:
We get it, not everyone loves snakes. You may not want to encounter one
in the wild. To each their own! That’s why we’re here, 
to take you on a world tour of some of nature’s most incredible snakes
from the safety of your home— and with your very own intrepid guide. All the snakes we’ll be visiting
belong to a group called the vipers. As of 2021, there are 368 species
of viper worldwide. The name comes from the term viviparity,
which means giving birth to live young. Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, most vipers have eggs 
that hatch inside the mother, who then gives birth 
to up to dozens of tiny snakes. Not glad you’re safe at home yet? Vipers are also often highly venomous, with two hollow fangs that fold flat
to the roofs of their mouths. This allows the fangs to be extra long, unfolding into imposing weapons
when the viper prepares to strike. So how about we pay them a surprise visit? First stop: 
the southeastern United States, where we can hear the viper
before we can see it. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is
the largest of 36 species of rattlesnake. Rattlesnakes can shake their rattles
up to 90 times per second to warn off predators 
for hours if needed. The rattle consists of hollow, interlocked
segments made of keratin, the same substance that makes
our nails and hair. When the snake shakes its tail,
these segments hit each other, creating a shockingly loud noise. Now onto the mountains of western Iran,
where a spider crawls across a rock, making easy prey for a passing bird—
or not. The spider-tailed horned viper is
perfectly camouflaged, almost invisible, except for its unique bulbous tail-tip
with long drooping scales that look like a leggy spider. Spider-tailed vipers
are only about 50 centimeters long, so they can lure small birds 
within striking range without compromising their ability 
to squeeze into narrow rock crevices. In the rainforests of Latin America 
lives a viper that couldn’t be more different
from the spider-tailed viper— if you can find it. It’s one of the most elusive snakes
in the world: the bushmaster. The bushmaster is a pit viper. Between each eye and nostril,
it has a heat-sensing pit with a membrane covered 
in highly sensitive receptors that respond to temperature changes as small as one one-thousandth 
of a degree Celsius. These pits gather infrared information
that is integrated with visual information in the optic tectum. This allows the bushmaster to “see” 
the heat signature of approaching prey or predators, helping it decide whether or not to strike
and strike more accurately. This comes in handy for guarding a nest— unlike most other vipers, 
the bushmaster lays eggs in hollowed out tree buttresses 
or burrows made by other animals. It must be large enough
to defend its nest— in fact, the bushmaster is the
largest viper in the world, reaching lengths of over 11 feet,
with huge fangs and deadly venom. Meanwhile, in the forests 
of sub-Saharan Africa, there’s a shorter, chunkier viper that’s 
even more venomous than the bushmaster. The African Gaboon viper has 
the longest fangs of any snake— yes, all 3,879 snake species, 
not just vipers— and can deliver 1,000 milligrams
of venom in a single bite— enough to kill ten adult humans. Although deadly, Gaboon vipers 
have a reputation for being slow-moving 
and placid creatures. When they do strike, they hold onto their 
rodent prey while the venom takes effect, then quickly swallow it down. At this point, you may be worrying
about our guide— but never fear, rodents like our little desert 
kangaroo rat have their own skills to evade the serpent’s tooth. They stomp their feet at rattlesnakes,
kick sand towards them, and evade their strikes 
with acrobatic leaps and powerful kicks— helping them live to guide 
another snake tour.

**Transcript**:
He was born in the 1330s 
in the Chaghatayid Khanate formerly the Mongol Empire
in Central Asia. On the unforgiving steppe,
he rose from a lowly sheep thief to become one of history’s 
greatest conquerors, uniting nearly all of Central Asia, 
Afghanistan, and Iran under his rule. But was he a great state builder 
or a bloodthirsty tyrant? Order! Order! 
Who do we have on the stand today? Tamer...lane? That wasn’t his name, your Honor. The great Timur— meaning iron—
was nicknamed “Timur the lame” by enemies who mocked permanent 
injuries to his leg and arm. Injuries he sustained raiding
a rival tribe’s sheep herd— he was a thief and a scoundrel
from the start! Maybe— we actually don’t know for sure—
but even if that’s true, raiding rivals was just part 
of nomadic life at the time. Timur was not born into a ruling family, so he had to prove his worth 
through daring and horsemanship. He was hardly a commoner. Timur’s family was minor nobility. His uncle and brother-in-law were
high-ranking officials. And when they trusted Timur
on a diplomatic mission, he defected to a rival khan! Strategic maneuvering! He reconciled with his uncle 
and brother-in-law soon after. Only for long enough to consolidate
his own power. Then he went to battle against
his brother-in-law— supposedly his closest ally. He was assassinated,
and Timur seized power! They may have been friends, but he was a corrupt man 
who alienated a lot of people. Timur was right to oust him. Afterward, he managed to reunite 
most of the khanate’s territories and put an end to decades 
of bloody infighting. Okay, so where are we?
I can hardly keep up. 1370, your honor. And he’s khan now? Well, not quite. Timur was not a direct descendant 
of Genghis Khan, so he couldn’t claim the title. Instead, he appointed figurehead khans
and referred to himself as amir, or commander, 
and later as güregen, or son-in-law, after he married a woman who was 
descended from Genghis Khan. He claimed to be a divinely ordained
protector of the Mongol and Muslim worlds, yet he undermined both 
Mongol and Muslim power by relentlessly waging
war against his neighbors, weakening them so much that Christian
Europe romanticized him as an ally. His campaigns killed as many 
as 17 million people! Propaganda. Timur’s official biographies deliberately 
exaggerated the number of deaths to deter rebellions. Like the Mongols, Timur offered
cities the chance to surrender and only ordered massacres
if they revolted. He rebuilt irrigation canals
to support agriculture, and regularly distributed
food to the poor. Just in his hometown of Kesh, he paid for the meat of 20 sheep 
to be given to the poor every day. His campaigns were brutal, but by unifying Central Asia,
Afghanistan, and Iran, he was also able to reinvigorate
the Silk Road. Much of Eurasia benefited from the revival
of long-distance trade, and Central Asian cities,
such as Samarkand and Herat, became thriving commercial hubs
under his rule. And meanwhile, other cities 
like Baghdad, Aleppo, and Delhi were plundered and burned
and took decades to recover. This illiterate warlord destroyed
centuries’ worth of cultural heritage, leaving nothing but pyramids
of skulls in his wake. Timur may have been illiterate, but he was also an active patron
of culture and the arts. During his conquests, 
he spared artisans and scholars, sending them to work on public projects
like schools and mosques. Unlike many women in the world
at the time, his wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law were highly educated 
and politically active. Timur also personally met with—
and impressed— the famed Arab historian 
Ibn Khaldun in Damascus, and he so thoroughly mastered chess
that he is said to have enjoyed a more complex variant 
that was named for him. So what happened after that? Timur died from an illness in 1405,
when he was likely in his early 70s. The empire he founded lasted 
another hundred years, ushering in an architectural, artistic,
literary and scientific renaissance across Central Asia. In Samarkand, Timur’s grandson, 
Ulugh Beg, built the largest astronomical observatory
in the world at the time. Even after the fall of Timur's empire, his descendant Babur re-established
himself in India, founding the Mughal Empire, which would become home to nearly 
a quarter of the world’s population and which built such splendors
as the Red Fort and Taj Mahal. Timur's legacy is still celebrated
in monuments across Central Asia, where he is remembered as 
“Buyuk Babamiz” or “our great forefather.” And yet today in Europe, India,
and much of the Middle East, he's remembered as a butcher. That’s more reflection of the success
of his own propaganda than of the man himself. Hold on now, I think
I’ve almost got the king cornered! Emerging from relative obscurity,
Timur’s conquests formed a legacy lasting nearly 500 years 
that remains on trial even today.

a rival tribe’s sheep herd— he was a thief and a scoundrel
from the start! Maybe— we actually don’t know for sure—
but even if that’s true, raiding rivals was just part 
of nomadic life at the time. Timur was not born into a ruling family, so he had to prove his worth 
through daring and horsemanship. He was hardly a commoner. Timur’s family was minor nobility. His uncle and brother-in-law were
high-ranking officials. And when they trusted Timur
on a diplomatic mission, he defected to a rival khan! Strategic maneuvering! He reconciled with his uncle

his own power. Then he went to battle against
his brother-in-law— supposedly his closest ally. He was assassinated,

I can hardly keep up. 1370, your honor. And he’s khan now? Well, not quite. Timur was not a direct descendant 
of Genghis Khan, so he couldn’t claim the title. Instead, he appointed figurehead khans
and referred to himself as amir, or commander, 
and later as güregen, or son-in-law, after he married a woman who was 
descended from Genghis Khan. He claimed to be a divinely ordained
protector of the Mongol and Muslim worlds, yet he undermined both 
Mongol and Muslim power by relentlessly waging
war against his neighbors, weakening them so much that Christian
Europe romanticized him as an ally. His campaigns killed as many 
as 17 million people! Propaganda. Timur’s official biographies deliberately 
exaggerated the number of deaths to deter rebellions. Like the Mongols, Timur offered
cities the chance to surrender and only ordered massacres
if they revolted. He rebuilt irrigation canals
to support agriculture, and regularly distributed
food to the poor. Just in his hometown of Kesh, he paid for the meat of 20 sheep 
to be given to the poor every day. His campaigns were brutal, but by unifying Central Asia,
Afghanistan, and Iran, he was also able to reinvigorate
the Silk Road. Much of Eurasia benefited from the revival
of long-distance trade, and Central Asian cities,
such as Samarkand and Herat, became thriving commercial hubs
under his rule. And meanwhile, other cities 
like Baghdad, Aleppo, and Delhi were plundered and burned
and took decades to recover. This illiterate warlord destroyed
centuries’ worth of cultural heritage, leaving nothing but pyramids
of skulls in his wake. Timur may have been illiterate, but he was also an active patron

he spared artisans and scholars, sending them to work on public projects

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1859, miners following 
the Colorado gold rush woke up to another sunny day. Or so they thought. To their surprise,
they soon discovered it was actually 1 am; and the sky wasn’t lit by the Sun,
but rather by brilliant drapes of light. The blazing glow could be seen as far 
as the Caribbean, leading people in many regions to believe
that nearby cities had caught fire. But the true cause of what would come
to be known as the Carrington Event was a solar storm—
the largest in recorded history. Solar storms are one of many astrophysical
phenomena caused by magnetic fields. These fields are generated by movements 
of electrically charged particles like protons and electrons. For example, Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated by charged molten metals circulating in the planet's outer core. Similarly, the Sun’s magnetic field 
is generated by large convective movements in the plasma that composes the star. As this plasma slowly swirls, it creates areas of intense magnetic
activity called sunspots. The magnetic fields that form 
near these regions often become twisted and strained. And when they’re stretched too far,
they snap into simpler configurations, releasing energy that launches plasma
from the Sun’s surface. These explosions are known 
as coronal mass ejections. The plasma— mostly made of protons 
and electrons— accelerates rapidly, quickly reaching thousands
of kilometers per second. A typical coronal mass ejection covers
the distance between the Sun and the Earth in just a couple of days, flowing along the magnetic field 
that permeates the solar system. And those that cross the Earth’s path
are drawn to its magnetic field lines, falling into the atmosphere 
around the planet’s magnetic poles. This tidal wave of high-energy particles
excites atmospheric atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to rapidly shed
photons at various energy levels. The result is a magnificent light show
we know as the auroras. And while this phenomenon is usually 
only visible near the Earth’s poles, strong solar storms can bring in 
enough high energy particles to light up large stretches of the sky. The magnetic fields in our solar system
are nothing compared to those found in deep space. Some neutron stars generate fields 
100 billion times stronger than those found in sunspots. And the magnetic fields 
around supermassive black holes expel jets of gas that extend 
for thousands of light years. However, on Earth, even weak solar storms
can be surprisingly dangerous. While the storms that reach us 
are generally harmless to humans, the high-energy particles 
falling into the atmosphere create secondary magnetic fields, which in turn generate rogue currents 
that short-circuit electrical equipment. During the Carrington Event, the only widespread electrical
technology was the telegraph. But since then, we've only become more
dependent on electrical systems. In 1921, another powerful solar
storm caused telephones and telegraph equipment 
around the globe to combust. In New York, the entire railway system 
was shut down and fires broke out in the central control building. Comparatively weak storms in 1989 and 2003 turned off regions 
of the Canadian power grid and damaged multiple satellites. If we were hit by a storm as strong
as the Carrington Event today, it could devastate our interconnected,
electrified planet. Fortunately, we're not defenseless. After centuries of observing sunspots, researchers have learned 
the Sun’s usual magnetic activity follows an 11-year cycle, giving us a window into when solar storms
are most likely to occur. And as our ability to forecast
space weather has improved, so have our mitigation measures. Power grids can be shut off 
in advance of a solar storm, while capacitors can be installed 
to absorb the sudden influx of energy. Many modern satellites and spacecraft 
are equipped with special shielding to absorb the impact of a solar storm. But even with these safeguards, it’s hard to say how our technology 
will fare during the next major event. It’s possible we’ll be left with only
the aurora overhead to light the path forward.

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1859, miners following 
the Colorado gold rush woke up to another sunny day. Or so they thought. To their surprise,
they soon discovered it was actually 1 am; and the sky wasn’t lit by the Sun,
but rather by brilliant drapes of light. The blazing glow could be seen as far 
as the Caribbean, leading people in many regions to believe
that nearby cities had caught fire. But the true cause of what would come
to be known as the Carrington Event was a solar storm—
the largest in recorded history. Solar storms are one of many astrophysical
phenomena caused by magnetic fields. These fields are generated by movements 
of electrically charged particles like protons and electrons. For example, Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated by charged molten metals circulating in the planet's outer core. Similarly, the Sun’s magnetic field 
is generated by large convective movements in the plasma that composes the star. As this plasma slowly swirls, it creates areas of intense magnetic
activity called sunspots. The magnetic fields that form 
near these regions often become twisted and strained. And when they’re stretched too far,
they snap into simpler configurations, releasing energy that launches plasma
from the Sun’s surface. These explosions are known 
as coronal mass ejections. The plasma— mostly made of protons 
and electrons— accelerates rapidly, quickly reaching thousands
of kilometers per second. A typical coronal mass ejection covers
the distance between the Sun and the Earth in just a couple of days, flowing along the magnetic field 
that permeates the solar system. And those that cross the Earth’s path
are drawn to its magnetic field lines, falling into the atmosphere 
around the planet’s magnetic poles. This tidal wave of high-energy particles
excites atmospheric atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to rapidly shed
photons at various energy levels. The result is a magnificent light show
we know as the auroras. And while this phenomenon is usually 
only visible near the Earth’s poles, strong solar storms can bring in 
enough high energy particles to light up large stretches of the sky. The magnetic fields in our solar system
are nothing compared to those found in deep space. Some neutron stars generate fields 
100 billion times stronger than those found in sunspots. And the magnetic fields 
around supermassive black holes expel jets of gas that extend 
for thousands of light years. However, on Earth, even weak solar storms
can be surprisingly dangerous. While the storms that reach us 
are generally harmless to humans, the high-energy particles 
falling into the atmosphere create secondary magnetic fields, which in turn generate rogue currents 
that short-circuit electrical equipment. During the Carrington Event, the only widespread electrical
technology was the telegraph. But since then, we've only become more
dependent on electrical systems. In 1921, another powerful solar
storm caused telephones and telegraph equipment 
around the globe to combust. In New York, the entire railway system 
was shut down and fires broke out in the central control building. Comparatively weak storms in 1989 and 2003 turned off regions 
of the Canadian power grid and damaged multiple satellites. If we were hit by a storm as strong
as the Carrington Event today, it could devastate our interconnected,
electrified planet. Fortunately, we're not defenseless. After centuries of observing sunspots, researchers have learned 
the Sun’s usual magnetic activity follows an 11-year cycle, giving us a window into when solar storms
are most likely to occur. And as our ability to forecast
space weather has improved, so have our mitigation measures. Power grids can be shut off 
in advance of a solar storm, while capacitors can be installed 
to absorb the sudden influx of energy. Many modern satellites and spacecraft 
are equipped with special shielding to absorb the impact of a solar storm. But even with these safeguards, it’s hard to say how our technology 
will fare during the next major event. It’s possible we’ll be left with only
the aurora overhead to light the path forward.

**Transcript**:
It’s your first day in your new job 
as Center Realm’s official cartographer, and you've already got a big problem. Center Realm is home to three 
elder dragons: two ice, one fire, and they’ve lived in harmony 
on the east coast for centuries. But scouts have sighted three fire dragons
and five ice dragons flying across the Western Ocean. You’ll only have a few hours to assign 
them their designated regions before they’ll arrive. Elder dragons are extremely territorial. Each must have its own, 
officially acknowledged stomping ground. They’ll peacefully roost there unless
their region borders another dragon of the same type, in which case the matching dragons 
will go on a rampage. However, fire and ice dragons 
can border each other, and matching regions can touch at corners. You’ll soon have 11 dragons
and just 8 regions. Fortunately, you have enough 
political capital to create 3 new regions, each of which must be 
completely enclosed spaces. Add more or otherwise mess this up,
and you’ll lose your job and your head. Where do you draw lines 
and place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It isn't difficult to create
three new regions. What is more challenging 
is to make sure the result will keep each dragon
away from its own kind. For instance, this can be 
neither ice nor fire, because it borders both. However, create a new region like this,
and suddenly there are viable options. Why did that work? Look at the point
where these four regions meet. If you go around it, it alternates
between fire and ice. Before the new line was added,
that wouldn’t have worked. Nor would 5 or 7 regions. 6 and 8, however, both do. The pattern is that points where lines
meet must be surrounded by an even number of regions. As long as that’s true, you can color 
the map in two colors, by alternating them around those points. In our initial arrangement,
there were six such meeting points. So what we want to do is connect
those to each other. Each line adds a single new region
that touches both meeting points. There are several ways to do this
to accommodate all 8 new dragons. You’ve done such a great job 
that your boss puts you in a ship and sends you out across the Western Sea
to investigate where these new dragons are coming from. There you’re met
with a civilization in disarray. Their 17 elder dragons are ravaging 
the countryside, wiping out the peasants, devastating all the people 
and their thatch-roofed cottages. And here there aren't just ice and fire
dragons, but lightning dragons too. Their people will only allow 
the creation of two new regions. Where do you create new regions
and place all the dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Unfortunately, our meeting-point trick
won’t suffice now that there are three dragon types, so we need to find another
method to identify problem areas. A great way to do so is to experiment: focus on one area and start coloring
until we run out of possibilities. Take this section. These 3 regions all border each other,
so they need to be different colors. But they also all touch this giant
territory, which we now can’t color. To generalize the issue, when there are
4 regions that all border each other, it's impossible to color
them with three colors. The map has two other such areas. So what you need to do is break them up. And once again, the key is drawing lines
between points where multiple problematic regions touch. No matter how you do it, you’ll effectively subdivide 
the giant territory into smaller ones. Now coloring the map becomes
a logic puzzle. So long as you approach it systematically
by starting in one area and radiating out, you’ll reach an arrangement 
that you can fit all your dragons into, shifting the colors as needed. Just assign this region last, 
because it’ll have two options. You've saved not one, but two continents
from certain ruin. Now to see if you can find a giant eagle
and hitch a ride back home.

**Transcript**:
It’s your first day in your new job 
as Center Realm’s official cartographer, and you've already got a big problem. Center Realm is home to three 
elder dragons: two ice, one fire, and they’ve lived in harmony 
on the east coast for centuries. But scouts have sighted three fire dragons
and five ice dragons flying across the Western Ocean. You’ll only have a few hours to assign 
them their designated regions before they’ll arrive. Elder dragons are extremely territorial. Each must have its own, 
officially acknowledged stomping ground. They’ll peacefully roost there unless
their region borders another dragon of the same type, in which case the matching dragons 
will go on a rampage. However, fire and ice dragons 
can border each other, and matching regions can touch at corners. You’ll soon have 11 dragons
and just 8 regions. Fortunately, you have enough 
political capital to create 3 new regions, each of which must be 
completely enclosed spaces. Add more or otherwise mess this up,
and you’ll lose your job and your head. Where do you draw lines 
and place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It isn't difficult to create
three new regions. What is more challenging 
is to make sure the result will keep each dragon
away from its own kind. For instance, this can be 
neither ice nor fire, because it borders both. However, create a new region like this,
and suddenly there are viable options. Why did that work? Look at the point
where these four regions meet. If you go around it, it alternates
between fire and ice. Before the new line was added,
that wouldn’t have worked. Nor would 5 or 7 regions. 6 and 8, however, both do. The pattern is that points where lines
meet must be surrounded by an even number of regions. As long as that’s true, you can color 
the map in two colors, by alternating them around those points. In our initial arrangement,
there were six such meeting points. So what we want to do is connect
those to each other. Each line adds a single new region
that touches both meeting points. There are several ways to do this
to accommodate all 8 new dragons. You’ve done such a great job 
that your boss puts you in a ship and sends you out across the Western Sea
to investigate where these new dragons are coming from. There you’re met
with a civilization in disarray. Their 17 elder dragons are ravaging 
the countryside, wiping out the peasants, devastating all the people 
and their thatch-roofed cottages. And here there aren't just ice and fire
dragons, but lightning dragons too. Their people will only allow 
the creation of two new regions. Where do you create new regions
and place all the dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Unfortunately, our meeting-point trick
won’t suffice now that there are three dragon types, so we need to find another
method to identify problem areas. A great way to do so is to experiment: focus on one area and start coloring
until we run out of possibilities. Take this section. These 3 regions all border each other,
so they need to be different colors. But they also all touch this giant
territory, which we now can’t color. To generalize the issue, when there are

**Transcript**:
You’re a butterfly, fluttering around
pursuing a butterfly’s whims. Then you wake up. But how do you know
you’re not dreaming now? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s actually very difficult 
to explain how, definitively, you know you’re awake. So difficult, in fact, that it has puzzled
philosophers since ancient times. In the butterfly scenario, the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi
surfaced a mystifying possibility: if we can dream of being 
an entirely different creature, who's to say we're not actually a different creature dreaming 
of being human? Bizarre things happen in dreams: you fly, or conjure an all-you-can-eat 
dessert buffet out of thin air, or get chased by witches through the halls
of your elementary school, which suddenly looks a lot like Paris. But the strange things that happen 
in dreams don’t seem strange at the time. So how do you know you’re not
in a dream right now that will seem very strange
after you wake up? Well, it is possible to notice the strangeness of a dream
while you’re dreaming. Lucid dreamers know they’re dreaming. By definition, if you were having 
a lucid dream, you would know it. But all that proves is 
that you’re not having a lucid dream— it doesn’t prove you’re awake. There has to be a surefire test— something that never— or only—
happens when you’re awake, something that never— or only—
happens in a dream. Wake up.
No, that isn’t it— you can wake up in a dream. Pinch yourself.
If it hurts, aren’t you really awake? Try to read or write something. Run around the room. Does your pace seem normal 
or suspiciously slow? Suspiciously fast? Can’t tell? Try to remember
the last time you ran. Actually, that brings us 
to an even better test from the 17th century French philosopher
René Descartes. He pointed out that in our memories,
dreams are disconnected— the events of a dream don’t fit
in to the chain of events in our waking lives. This seems rock solid, doesn't it? You couldn’t possibly have swum 
with dolphins in a nameless pink sea between Christmas 
and New Year’s Eve because you didn’t leave Kansas 
and you have the receipts to prove it. Well, one of Descartes’ contemporaries, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes,
had something to say about that: what if Descartes was performing his test
in a dream? What if we ask an expert? A neuroscientist can measure the activity
in different parts of your brain and tell you whether you’re awake
or sleeping. But that just brings us back to the idea
that any test you might use to prove you’re awake 
could take place in a dream. So far, no one has found
a convincing response to this. But let’s be real: there’s a whole lot
more detail in our waking experience than in dreams. We go to sleep and wake up again
day after day for many years, and each new day is full  of countless 
people, places, things, experiences. Even our memories, which capture 
just a fraction of this experience, contain an almost incomprehensibly vast
amount of detail: we can recall a line from a favorite book
decades later, remember the musty smell of its pages and the taste of the lemonade we drank 
while reading it, remember a dream we had
about it and tell someone all this. Isn't it ridiculous to suggest a dream
could ever simulate this richness? Well, as the Persian philosopher
al-Ghazali pointed out, in the same way we think we are now awake
having woken from dreams, it is possible that we might wake 
from our current state into another state 
of even greater wakefulness. Which would mean we’re really
in a kind of dream-state when we think we’re awake. What philosophers really want to know 
is what justifies our belief that we’re awake. We all want to believe things
because we have reasons for them, not just because they seem right. Sometimes, the biggest challenge is 
to show why we should believe something that seems completely obvious to us all.

**Transcript**:
You’re a butterfly, fluttering around
pursuing a butterfly’s whims. Then you wake up. But how do you know
you’re not dreaming now? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s actually very difficult 
to explain how, definitively, you know you’re awake. So difficult, in fact, that it has puzzled
philosophers since ancient times. In the butterfly scenario, the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi
surfaced a mystifying possibility: if we can dream of being 
an entirely different creature, who's to say we're not actually a different creature dreaming 
of being human? Bizarre things happen in dreams: you fly, or conjure an all-you-can-eat 
dessert buffet out of thin air, or get chased by witches through the halls
of your elementary school, which suddenly looks a lot like Paris. But the strange things that happen 
in dreams don’t seem strange at the time. So how do you know you’re not
in a dream right now that will seem very strange
after you wake up? Well, it is possible to notice the strangeness of a dream
while you’re dreaming. Lucid dreamers know they’re dreaming. By definition, if you were having 
a lucid dream, you would know it. But all that proves is 
that you’re not having a lucid dream— it doesn’t prove you’re awake. There has to be a surefire test— something that never— or only—
happens when you’re awake, something that never— or only—
happens in a dream. Wake up.
No, that isn’t it— you can wake up in a dream. Pinch yourself.
If it hurts, aren’t you really awake? Try to read or write something. Run around the room. Does your pace seem normal 
or suspiciously slow? Suspiciously fast? Can’t tell? Try to remember
the last time you ran. Actually, that brings us 
to an even better test from the 17th century French philosopher
René Descartes. He pointed out that in our memories,
dreams are disconnected— the events of a dream don’t fit
in to the chain of events in our waking lives. This seems rock solid, doesn't it? You couldn’t possibly have swum 
with dolphins in a nameless pink sea between Christmas 
and New Year’s Eve because you didn’t leave Kansas 
and you have the receipts to prove it. Well, one of Descartes’ contemporaries, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes,
had something to say about that: what if Descartes was performing his test
in a dream? What if we ask an expert? A neuroscientist can measure the activity
in different parts of your brain and tell you whether you’re awake
or sleeping. But that just brings us back to the idea
that any test you might use to prove you’re awake 
could take place in a dream. So far, no one has found
a convincing response to this. But let’s be real: there’s a whole lot
more detail in our waking experience than in dreams. We go to sleep and wake up again
day after day for many years, and each new day is full  of countless 
people, places, things, experiences. Even our memories, which capture 
just a fraction of this experience, contain an almost incomprehensibly vast
amount of detail: we can recall a line from a favorite book
decades later, remember the musty smell of its pages and the taste of the lemonade we drank 
while reading it, remember a dream we had
about it and tell someone all this. Isn't it ridiculous to suggest a dream
could ever simulate this richness? Well, as the Persian philosopher
al-Ghazali pointed out, in the same way we think we are now awake
having woken from dreams, it is possible that we might wake 
from our current state into another state 
of even greater wakefulness. Which would mean we’re really
in a kind of dream-state when we think we’re awake. What philosophers really want to know 
is what justifies our belief that we’re awake. We all want to believe things
because we have reasons for them, not just because they seem right. Sometimes, the biggest challenge is 
to show why we should believe something that seems completely obvious to us all.

**Transcript**:
It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944 and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic 368 kilometer journey. He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather, flying an average of 79 kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight. Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the D-Day invasion back to England. He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment. Paddy was one of around 250,000 pigeons used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages. In fact, pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices. Seeing their meat as a protein source and their nitrogen-rich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer, humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as 10,000 years ago. We then tapped into other traits. Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct that drives them to navigate
long distances back to the location they consider “home.” So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing. In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying,” people selected for traits 
like head plumage and fabulously feathered feet. As we carried pigeons around the world,
they escaped or were released, forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today. Pigeons are now one of the most abundant,
widespread species on the planet, managing to thrive in chaotic cities. They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits, including some that were
accentuated by humans. Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees, pigeons were originally cliff-dwellers. City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat. And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking. Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass and it's a great spot to raise babies. This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments where more specialized species can’t. As generalists, pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste. With an organ in their throats 
called a crop, they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later. They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food. Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and protein-rich meal. If conditions are right,
pigeons breed year-round and produce new offspring every six weeks. They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities because of the abundance 
of food and shelter. These booming populations 
attract predators. New York City is home 
to a million pigeons, which support large populations
of raptors. But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight, further exploited by being bred
for racing, means they’re made 
for high speed chases. Compared to barn owls,
which are a similar size, pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved, providing extra space for muscle mass. They can reach speeds 
of 125 kilometers per hour. And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout. While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife, we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors. In 1966, New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings” and it stuck. Indeed, their poop, which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer, presents a unique problem. Just one pigeon can leave behind 
11 kilograms of acidic excrement per year, which, in the United States, 
scales to about $1.1 billion in structural damage annually. Though incidents of infection are rare, this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled. They may be numerous, noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, 
ongoing relationship. Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort. For better or for worse, 
we did this to ourselves.

**Transcript**:
As a new widow, Sarah Rosas Garcia was already struggling to support
her nine children when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities. Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter
would be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place 
in Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been
efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some
traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery
of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down. However, their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color
and people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans
of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called
“racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, 
and people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden, 
Canada, and Japan forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were 
59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims 
of these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including
sterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research 
into human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers, and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 1979. Unfortunately today, the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities still continues around the globe.

**Transcript**:
As a new widow, Sarah Rosas Garcia was already struggling to support
her nine children when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities. Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter
would be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place 
in Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been
efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some
traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery
of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down. However, their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color
and people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans
of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called
“racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, 
and people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden, 
Canada, and Japan forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were 
59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims 
of these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including
sterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research 
into human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers, and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 1979. Unfortunately today, the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities still continues around the globe.

**Transcript**:
The moon goddess, Ix Chel, patiently
watched a spider at work. She could make use of it skills, 
she thought. Through careful observation and imitation,
she soon became a skilled weaver. The sun god, Kinich Ahau, 
was impressed with her work, and admired her from afar. But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter. To get past the grandfather,
the sun god disguised himself as a hummingbird. As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey, the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather to capture the bird for her. The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings
and fly again. He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess to escape with him. The two rowed away in a canoe, but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god to help him stop them. Sensing danger, the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below and transformed into a crab. But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered, buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body. For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, 
cleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs. On the thirteenth night, 
the logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever. The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage. The moon goddess happily agreed. Side-by-side, they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays. Unfortunately, the story 
doesn’t end there. The sun god’s brother visited often. Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel, 
the sun god grew jealous, and began to mistreat her. One day, Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank, furious at her husband. A huge bird came gliding down and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks. To get away from the cruel sun god,
she agreed. There, she met the king of the vultures. The vulture king was kind and fun-loving— a much better partner
than the violent sun god. The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains. When the sun god heard, he was distraught. He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down, then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king. He begged her to come home with him,
apologizing for how he had treated her. The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back. But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again. He struck her, scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays. Ix Chel flew off into the dark. From then on, she vowed 
to appear only at night. She befriended the stars, and combined
her pale blue rays with their light to guide night travelers to safety. She used her healing gift, which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god, to cure people who were ill. Today, Ix Chel is so widely known that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture. But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities. In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists, the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends beyond the limits 
of the historical record. Her story, like all myths, 
isn’t just one story: the variations, ancient and modern,
speak to what people value, and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes.

and invited the moon goddess to escape with him. The two rowed away in a canoe, but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god to help him stop them. Sensing danger, the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below and transformed into a crab. But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered, buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body. For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, 
cleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs. On the thirteenth night, 
the logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever. The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage. The moon goddess happily agreed. Side-by-side, they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays. Unfortunately, the story 
doesn’t end there. The sun god’s brother visited often. Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel, 
the sun god grew jealous, and began to mistreat her. One day, Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank, furious at her husband. A huge bird came gliding down and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks. To get away from the cruel sun god,
she agreed. There, she met the king of the vultures. The vulture king was kind and fun-loving— a much better partner
than the violent sun god. The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains. When the sun god heard, he was distraught. He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down, then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king. He begged her to come home with him,
apologizing for how he had treated her. The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back. But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again. He struck her, scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays. Ix Chel flew off into the dark. From then on, she vowed 
to appear only at night. She befriended the stars, and combined
her pale blue rays with their light to guide night travelers to safety. She used her healing gift, which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god, to cure people who were ill. Today, Ix Chel is so widely known that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture. But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities. In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists, the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends beyond the limits 
of the historical record. Her story, like all myths, 
isn’t just one story: the variations, ancient and modern,
speak to what people value, and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes.

vladimir in ukrainian volodymir and as fate would have it these are also the names of the presidents of these two countries today anyway russians ukrainians and better russians draw their lineage from this slavic state a lot changed in the centuries that followed and for a lot of it ukraine was under russian rule in the 1900s the two were soviet republics russia the most powerful of the 15 republics and ukraine the second most powerful it had defence industries large agricultural lands and housed much of the soviet nuclear arsenal during the cold war ukraine was the arch rival of the united states the soviet union collapsed in 1991 ukraine became independent as did russia ukraine inherited much of soviet nuclear arsenal but gave it up to russia in 1994. in exchange moscow guaranteed ukraine's security and promised to respect its sovereignty they signed the budapest memorandum along with these countries cut to november 2013 viktor yanukovych was the president of ukraine he had a reputation for heavy-handedness corruption and above all for being openly pro-moscow in 2013 he rejected an eu trade deal this deal could have meant greater integration with the european union instead yanukovych decided to take a 15 billion dollar bailout from russia to many ukrainians it felt like being sold to moscow so protests broke out they were called euromaidan euro because these protests were about europe and maidan because they happened in kiev's maidan what we today know as the independent square here protesters chanted signed the eu deal yanukovych must step down russia supported the president the west supported the protesters in february 2014 yanukovich's government was toppled the president was driven out of ukraine he fled to russia not every ukrainian was happy with this many in the russian speaking east wanted yanukovich to stay when he was driven out the minority felt disenfranchised on the other side of the border russia was angry it had lost its puppet to salvage the situation moscow annexed crimea why crimea well let's now zoom into this part of the world crimea is a peninsula it is located in the black sea in 1954 soviet leader nikita khrushchev transferred crimea it was given to the ukrainian soviet socialist republic from the russian soviet socialist republic why khrushchev hoped the transfer would strengthen quote unquote brotherly ties between the ukrainian and russian people both russia and crimea were part of the soviet union so this transfer did not mean very much when ukraine became independent in 1991 crimea joined it the peninsula was given special autonomy it remained home to russian military bases moscow promised to respect crimean autonomy many in russia were of the opinion that crimea should not have been allowed to join ukraine in 2014 when yanukovych was ousted from power in ukraine russian military began seizing government buildings in crimea so the entire peninsula was under military occupation a referendum followed on the 16th of march 2014 crimeans voted to become a part of russia was this vote legitimate well it depends on who you ask for putin this was crimea's liberation for the rest of the world this was crimea's annexation the focus then shifted to eastern ukraine where russia backed separatists had seized territory ukrainian forces did not launch an all-out offensive at first but on the 17th of july 2014 when a flight carrying 298 people were shot down by these rebels ukrainian forces decided to flush out the rebels the separatists began losing ground so the russian army stepped in they invaded eastern ukraine and fought alongside the rebels what followed was a series of talks between russia ukraine and the west they resulted in the minsk accords this was

stands as the largest european country excluding russia it covers an area of more than six hundred thousand square kilometers with a population of 44 million and a gdp of more than 155 billion dollars

history and heritage ukraine also remains at war its forces are fighting the rebels in the east rebel leaders are ruling at least two regions donetsk and luansk together they're known as the donbass region russia has once again sent its troops this time they're stationed right at the border what does vladimir putin want for nato to stop expanding nato stands for north atlantic treaty organization it's a military alliance these countries are the founding members of nato these countries joined it during the cold war and these countries joined after it ukraine wants to join nato too but putin wants nato to exclude ukraine and every former soviet state and this is just half the story like i said a lot is hidden in history for starters there is domestic politics when putin annexed crimea his approval rating skyrocketed keeping the nationalistic drum rolling helps the russian president annexing parts of ukraine also helps putin restore russia's superpower image again back to history many russians view ukraine's independence as a mistake it is true that ukraine was ruled by russia in fact ukraine has barely remained independent pre-1991 there was a brief period before world war one and then another stint in 1600 for the rest of its modern history ukraine was under russia one in six ukrainians is an ethnic russian one in three speaks russian as a native language so putin is right when he says historically they were one but claiming ukraine on the basis of colonial history is wrong it will be like britain claiming india or south africa or spain claiming the philippines past

sentiment in the west most ukrainians speak ukrainian in the east a third are native russians in the west russia is looked at with suspicion in the east russia is looked at through the lens of shared history and heritage ukraine also remains at war its forces are fighting the rebels in the east rebel leaders are ruling at least two regions donetsk and luansk together they're known as the donbass region russia has once again sent its troops this time they're stationed right at the border what does vladimir putin want for nato to stop expanding nato stands for north atlantic treaty organization it's a military alliance these countries are the founding members of nato these countries joined it during the cold war and these countries joined after it ukraine wants to join nato too but putin wants nato to exclude ukraine and every former soviet state and this is just half the story like i said a lot is hidden in history for starters there is domestic politics when putin annexed crimea his approval rating skyrocketed keeping the nationalistic drum rolling helps the russian president annexing parts of ukraine also helps putin restore russia's superpower image again back to history many russians view ukraine's independence as a mistake it is true that ukraine was ruled by russia in fact ukraine has barely remained independent pre-1991 there was a brief period before world war one and then another stint in 1600 for the rest of its modern history ukraine was under russia one in six ukrainians is an ethnic russian one in three speaks russian as a native language so putin is right when he says historically they were one but claiming ukraine on the basis of colonial history is wrong it will be like britain claiming india or south africa or spain claiming the philippines past imperialism cannot justify present-day expansionism here's what else history tells us ukraine was forcefully crucified cut to 1700 russian leader katherine the great started russifying ukraine ethnic russians were shipped to this part of the world schools were told to teach russian language by 1800 the ukrainian language was banned in 1930 soviet leader joseph stalin steered a famine in ukraine millions of eastern ukrainians were killed the area was then repopulated with ethnic russians in the 1940s the ethnic tartars were relocated they too were replaced with russians there is a reason why eastern ukraine today has so many native russian speakers it was designed to be that way eastern ukraine was always dear to russia it has coal it has iron fertile land its historical connection with russia was forced both in time and again talks about the holy ruse he says russians and ukrainians are one people seventy percent ukrainians reject this thought seventy two percent consider russia a hostile state today thirty three point three percent ukrainians are ready to take up arms against russia twenty one point seven percent are ready to stage a civil resistance against russia 67 percent ukrainians want to join the eu 59 percent want to join the nato meet the current ukrainian president volodymyr zielenski he came to power in 2019 following a landslide victory he is a vocal critic of russia zelensky openly opposes russian occupation of eastern ukraine 73 percent of ukrainian voters voted this man to power today volodymir zelensky represents the pulse of ukraine the ukraine that wants to remain independent of russia but vladimir putin wants to become the man who revived russian imperialism he does not realize the world has moved on [Music]

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 3
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and... wow, you’re still reeling. You’re a particle of matter, 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,
as with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: 
with you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on,
to reach this final set. If you map them back 
to the original circle, standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive. So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles. You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before, but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,
perform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards 
starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,
each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, 
no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, 
this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs 
reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,
representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, 
subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks.

the bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before, but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,
perform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards 
starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,
each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, 
no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, 
this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs 
reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,
representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, 
subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks.

It’s moments after the Big Bang
and... wow, you’re still reeling. You’re a particle of matter, 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,
as with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: 
with you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle by marking all pairs

Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards 
starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,
each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, 
no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, 
this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs 
reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,
representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, 
subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog. Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled,
packaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began, 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought
the project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone 
San Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built; and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally
like a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers,
linked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss to pursue a different approach:
the suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, 
advanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible
due to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components
to California, reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable,
shallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor,
creating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts
between tides. The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked
the south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously,
requiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net 
below the towers. But not even these precautions 
could prevent an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete, 
workers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals,
and laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished,
but there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color 
still complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, 
and rolling fog.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1930s, two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog. Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled,
packaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began, 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought
the project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone 
San Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built; and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally
like a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers,
linked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss to pursue a different approach:
the suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, 
advanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible
due to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components
to California, reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable,
shallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor,
creating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts
between tides. The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked
the south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously,
requiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net 
below the towers. But not even these precautions 
could prevent an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete, 
workers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals,
and laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished,
but there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color 
still complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, 
and rolling fog.

**Transcript**:
Hera, queen of the gods, 
was on the edge of her throne. A mountain nymph named Echo, 
renowned for her charm and chatter, was regaling her with a sensational story. But what Hera didn’t know 
was that Echo was merely distracting her while her husband, Zeus, was frolicking about 
with the other nymphs. Unfortunately for Echo, Zeus got sloppy,
and Hera realized what was going on. Enraged by Echo’s duplicity— and powerless to stop 
her husband’s adultery— Hera decided to silence
the nymph for good. From then on, Echo could no longer
enrapture listeners with her stories; she could only repeat the last words
another said. As her conversations became dull 
and her company undesirable, Echo grew dispirited. One day, while Echo was drifting
through the woods, she spotted a young man hunting deer. It was Narcissus, the stunningly beautiful
son of a river god and water nymph. After his birth, a seer had given 
his mother a cryptic prophecy: Narcissus would live a long life—
but only if he never really knew himself. No one was sure exactly 
what to make of this. And, in the meantime,
Narcissus grew into a proud youth. His good looks attracted many admirers. But he preferred to amble through life
on his own and left a trail of broken hearts 
in his wake. Seeing Narcissus there, 
Echo was filled with longing. Unable to initiate a conversation,
she walked after him. Soon, Narcissus heard a rustle, 
and called out, “Who goes there? Who are you?” Echo revealed herself,
but only repeated the word “you,” making her tone as endearing as possible
as she went to hold him. Agitated, Narcissus said, 
“Let me go, I can’t stay.” Echo could only counter 
with a plea for him to do so. Freeing himself from her embrace,
Narcissus snapped, “I’d rather die than have you love me!” To which Echo could only cry,
“Love me... love me.” Narcissus told Echo once more 
to leave him alone, then faded from her gaze. Echo wandered to a cave. And gradually, her heart grew heavy
and her body frail until all that was left of her 
was her voice, which the wind carried to vast,
empty places. Forever after, it could be heard 
reverberating through hollow caves and rebounding across lonely clearings. But this wasn’t even the first time
heartbreak over Narcissus had proven fatal. A young man named Ameinias had also been
cruelly rejected by Narcissus. Before his death, he prayed to Nemesis,
the goddess of revenge, that Narcissus would also one day
know the pain of love. She heard Ameinias’ pleas and, 
upon witnessing Echo’s fate, decided that it would be 
the final affront. It was time for retribution. So, Nemesis set Narcissus 
towards a clear, glassy pool. As he bent towards the water to drink, he caught sight
of a hauntingly beautiful young man. Never before had Narcissus 
seen himself with such clarity. He spent the day acquainting himself
with every glinting angle and glowing curl then passed the evening 
gazing at his reflection by moonlight and sleeping with his fingers
grazing the water. Days wore on, and Narcissus never parted
from his one true love. When he reached out, 
his double reached for him; and when he leaned in to bestow a kiss,
he also tilted his face. But when he tried to hold 
the bewitching figure, it disappeared. At last, Narcissus knew the agony
of unrequited love. Eating and drinking nothing, 
Narcissus too wasted away. His neck ached from bending over the lake,
and his legs became rooted to the grass. When the wood nymphs finally passed by, all that was left of him 
was a white and yellow flower bending towards its reflection. From then on, it was known as narcissus.

to leave him alone, then faded from her gaze. Echo wandered to a cave. And gradually, her heart grew heavy
and her body frail until all that was left of her 
was her voice, which the wind carried to vast,
empty places. Forever after, it could be heard 
reverberating through hollow caves and rebounding across lonely clearings. But this wasn’t even the first time
heartbreak over Narcissus had proven fatal. A young man named Ameinias had also been
cruelly rejected by Narcissus. Before his death, he prayed to Nemesis,
the goddess of revenge, that Narcissus would also one day
know the pain of love. She heard Ameinias’ pleas and, 
upon witnessing Echo’s fate, decided that it would be 
the final affront. It was time for retribution. So, Nemesis set Narcissus 
towards a clear, glassy pool. As he bent towards the water to drink, he caught sight
of a hauntingly beautiful young man. Never before had Narcissus 
seen himself with such clarity. He spent the day acquainting himself
with every glinting angle and glowing curl then passed the evening 
gazing at his reflection by moonlight and sleeping with his fingers
grazing the water. Days wore on, and Narcissus never parted
from his one true love. When he reached out, 
his double reached for him; and when he leaned in to bestow a kiss,
he also tilted his face. But when he tried to hold 
the bewitching figure, it disappeared. At last, Narcissus knew the agony
of unrequited love. Eating and drinking nothing, 
Narcissus too wasted away. His neck ached from bending over the lake,
and his legs became rooted to the grass. When the wood nymphs finally passed by, all that was left of him 
was a white and yellow flower bending towards its reflection. From then on, it was known as narcissus.

**Transcript**:
Hera, queen of the gods, 
was on the edge of her throne. A mountain nymph named Echo, 
renowned for her charm and chatter, was regaling her with a sensational story. But what Hera didn’t know 
was that Echo was merely distracting her while her husband, Zeus, was frolicking about 
with the other nymphs. Unfortunately for Echo, Zeus got sloppy,
and Hera realized what was going on. Enraged by Echo’s duplicity— and powerless to stop 
her husband’s adultery— Hera decided to silence
the nymph for good. From then on, Echo could no longer
enrapture listeners with her stories; she could only repeat the last words
another said. As her conversations became dull 
and her company undesirable, Echo grew dispirited. One day, while Echo was drifting
through the woods, she spotted a young man hunting deer. It was Narcissus, the stunningly beautiful
son of a river god and water nymph. After his birth, a seer had given 
his mother a cryptic prophecy: Narcissus would live a long life—
but only if he never really knew himself. No one was sure exactly 
what to make of this. And, in the meantime,
Narcissus grew into a proud youth. His good looks attracted many admirers. But he preferred to amble through life
on his own and left a trail of broken hearts 
in his wake. Seeing Narcissus there, 
Echo was filled with longing. Unable to initiate a conversation,
she walked after him. Soon, Narcissus heard a rustle, 
and called out, “Who goes there? Who are you?” Echo revealed herself,
but only repeated the word “you,” making her tone as endearing as possible
as she went to hold him. Agitated, Narcissus said, 
“Let me go, I can’t stay.” Echo could only counter 
with a plea for him to do so. Freeing himself from her embrace,
Narcissus snapped, “I’d rather die than have you love me!” To which Echo could only cry,
“Love me... love me.” Narcissus told Echo once more 
to leave him alone, then faded from her gaze. Echo wandered to a cave. And gradually, her heart grew heavy
and her body frail until all that was left of her 
was her voice, which the wind carried to vast,

**Transcript**:
On April 12, 1961,
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin piloted a 2,400 kilogram spacecraft 
in humanity’s first manned space flight. One week later, Bell Aerosystems debuted
another advancement in aviation: the gas-powered rocket pack. Capable of flying 35 meters 
in just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers. But the device’s engineers
were less enthused. Despite years of cutting-edge work, they knew this short flight was all
the rocket pack could muster. So why was a massive spacecraft easier
to send flying than a single pilot? According to Newton's laws of motion, the physics behind flight are
actually quite simple. All you need is a powerful enough
upward force to counteract the downward force 
of gravity. And since objects with more mass
experience stronger gravitational forces, lighter objects should be easier
to get off the ground. However, modern jet engines,
our primary tool for flight, actually get more efficient
the larger they are. Jet engines work by sucking in huge
volumes of air, and then expelling that air
as quickly as possible. While most of this actually bypasses
the inner machinery, it still contributes to a huge portion
of the engine's thrust. But the air that does enter 
the engine’s core gets compressed by a series of tightly packed blades. That compressed air then enters
the combustion chamber, where it is injected with jet fuel
and ignited. The heat causes the compressed air 
to rapidly expand, bursting out of the exhaust 
and propelling the engine forward. As air leaves the engine it also turns 
a turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle. This turbine powers the fan
and the compressor blades, creating a cycle that maintains thrust
for as long as there’s fuel to burn. The more air an engine can take in and 
expel the more thrust it can produce. On a modern jet, the diameter 
of a frontal fan is larger than a truck. And even spinning 
at relatively low speeds, these engines produce more than enough
thrust to maintain the necessary speed for flying a passenger aircraft. But smaller engines simply can’t 
take in this much air. For most of the 20th century,
engineers couldn’t produce an engine small and light enough 
for an individual to wear, yet powerful enough to lift itself 
alongside its pilot and fuel. Designs could only carry enough fuel
for 30 seconds of flight, and when airborne, 
the powerful thrust in a single direction made jetpacks difficult
and dangerous to control. But the new millennium brought advances
in materials, manufacturing, and computing technology, including systems which could manage
fuel injection with incredible precision. Together, these dramatically improved 
the fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of jet engines. By 2016, micro-engines the size 
of a coffee can and weighing less than 2kg could achieve 220 Newtons of force. This was when an English engineer
named Richard Browning saw the opportunity to create 
a new kind of lightweight jetpack. In addition to a single engine
strapped to the back, this so-called Jet Suit involved a pair
of micro-engines on each arm to split and balance the thrust. Working with the back engine,
these provided three-points of stability, which some pilots describe as being 
akin to comfortably leaning on crutches while a friend supports your back. It may seem complicated to manage
all these engines at once, but many pilots master 
it in less than a day with the help of another 
advanced computer system— their brain. Various brain regions 
and multiple sensory systems perfectly calibrate our sense of balance 
and spatial orientation, helping pilots smoothly
direct their flights. Slight movements of the arms allow
operators to increase and decrease lift, quickly turn in mid-air, 
or glide forward for up to 5 minutes. This technology is still fairly new, and without major advances
in fuel efficiency and engine technology, don’t expect to have a jetpack
of your own any time soon. But if reaching for the sky
already got us this far, who knows where we'll fly next?

**Transcript**:
On April 12, 1961,
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin piloted a 2,400 kilogram spacecraft 
in humanity’s first manned space flight. One week later, Bell Aerosystems debuted
another advancement in aviation: the gas-powered rocket pack. Capable of flying 35 meters 
in just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers. But the device’s engineers
were less enthused. Despite years of cutting-edge work, they knew this short flight was all
the rocket pack could muster. So why was a massive spacecraft easier
to send flying than a single pilot? According to Newton's laws of motion, the physics behind flight are
actually quite simple. All you need is a powerful enough
upward force to counteract the downward force 
of gravity. And since objects with more mass
experience stronger gravitational forces, lighter objects should be easier
to get off the ground. However, modern jet engines,
our primary tool for flight, actually get more efficient
the larger they are. Jet engines work by sucking in huge
volumes of air, and then expelling that air
as quickly as possible. While most of this actually bypasses
the inner machinery, it still contributes to a huge portion
of the engine's thrust. But the air that does enter 
the engine’s core gets compressed by a series of tightly packed blades. That compressed air then enters
the combustion chamber, where it is injected with jet fuel
and ignited. The heat causes the compressed air 
to rapidly expand, bursting out of the exhaust 
and propelling the engine forward. As air leaves the engine it also turns 
a turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle. This turbine powers the fan
and the compressor blades, creating a cycle that maintains thrust
for as long as there’s fuel to burn. The more air an engine can take in and 
expel the more thrust it can produce. On a modern jet, the diameter 
of a frontal fan is larger than a truck. And even spinning 
at relatively low speeds, these engines produce more than enough
thrust to maintain the necessary speed for flying a passenger aircraft. But smaller engines simply can’t 
take in this much air. For most of the 20th century,
engineers couldn’t produce an engine small and light enough 
for an individual to wear, yet powerful enough to lift itself 
alongside its pilot and fuel. Designs could only carry enough fuel
for 30 seconds of flight, and when airborne, 
the powerful thrust in a single direction made jetpacks difficult
and dangerous to control. But the new millennium brought advances
in materials, manufacturing, and computing technology, including systems which could manage
fuel injection with incredible precision. Together, these dramatically improved 
the fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of jet engines. By 2016, micro-engines the size 
of a coffee can and weighing less than 2kg could achieve 220 Newtons of force. This was when an English engineer
named Richard Browning saw the opportunity to create 
a new kind of lightweight jetpack. In addition to a single engine
strapped to the back, this so-called Jet Suit involved a pair
of micro-engines on each arm to split and balance the thrust. Working with the back engine,
these provided three-points of stability, which some pilots describe as being 
akin to comfortably leaning on crutches while a friend supports your back. It may seem complicated to manage
all these engines at once, but many pilots master 
it in less than a day with the help of another 
advanced computer system— their brain. Various brain regions 
and multiple sensory systems perfectly calibrate our sense of balance 
and spatial orientation, helping pilots smoothly
direct their flights. Slight movements of the arms allow
operators to increase and decrease lift, quickly turn in mid-air, 
or glide forward for up to 5 minutes. This technology is still fairly new, and without major advances
in fuel efficiency and engine technology, don’t expect to have a jetpack
of your own any time soon. But if reaching for the sky
already got us this far, who knows where we'll fly next?

**Transcript**:
In 1945, two sculptures meant to represent
the average man and woman in the United States went on exhibit
at the American Museum of Natural History. Based on measurements taken from tens
of thousands of young men and women, they were called Norma and Normman. That same year, a contest launched
to find a living embodiment of Norma. Normal is often used as a synonym
for “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct.” By that logic, most people should fit 
the description of normal. And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women 
who participated in the contest matched Norma,
the supposedly “normal” woman. This puzzle isn’t unique 
to Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, 
so-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions 
have turned out to match almost no one. And yet, a lot of the world is constructed
around a foundation of normalcy. So what does normal actually mean—
and should we be relying on it so much? In statistics, a normal distribution 
describes  a set of values that fall along a bell curve. The average, or mean, of all the values
is at the very center, and most other values fall 
within the hump of the bell. These curves can be tall, with most values
inside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias
towards the average. What makes the distribution normal 
is that it follows this curved shape. Normal doesn’t describe a single data 
point, but a pattern of diversity. Many human traits, like height,
follow a normal distribution. Some people are very tall or very short, but most people fall close 
to the overall average. Outside of statistics, normal
often refers to an average— like the single number pulled 
from the fattest part of the bell curve— that eliminates all the nuance
of the normal distribution. Norma and Norman’s proportions
came from such averages. Applied to individuals, 
whether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely 
they hew to this average. At best, such definitions of normal 
fail to capture variation. But oftentimes, our calculations of normal
are even more flawed. Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index. BMI is a measure of weight
relative to height, with different ratios 
falling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,”
and “obese” ranges. Generally, only BMIs that correspond
to normal weight are considered healthy. But BMI is not always 
an accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight. BMI doesn’t take into account 
body fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical
activity, or blood pressure. And yet, those who fall outside
the so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing
or gaining weight will improve their health. When we apply a standard of normal
to all of humanity that’s based on data 
from a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one
point on the distribution, we’re choosing it 
from the wrong distribution. A lot of behavior science research draws
from samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, 
industrialized, rich, and democratic. These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have
an obvious link to them. Take the famed 
Muller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one 
of the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length. At least, it is if you’re
an American undergraduate. A team of anthropologists 
and psychologists found other demographic groups
were much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible 
to the illusion at all. When these limited or inaccurate
definitions of normal are used to make decisions 
that impact people’s lives, they can do real harm. Historically, such concepts of normal
have been hugely influential. The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th 
century weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, 
and even extermination of those deemed not normal. To this day, people are often targeted
and discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, 
mental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features
deemed “not normal.” But the reality is that the differences
in our bodies, minds, perceptions, and ideas about
the world around us— in short, diversity— 
is the true normal.

to find a living embodiment of Norma. Normal is often used as a synonym
for “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct.” By that logic, most people should fit 
the description of normal. And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women 
who participated in the contest matched Norma,
the supposedly “normal” woman. This puzzle isn’t unique 
to Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, 
so-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions 
have turned out to match almost no one. And yet, a lot of the world is constructed
around a foundation of normalcy. So what does normal actually mean—
and should we be relying on it so much? In statistics, a normal distribution 
describes  a set of values that fall along a bell curve. The average, or mean, of all the values
is at the very center, and most other values fall 
within the hump of the bell. These curves can be tall, with most values
inside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias
towards the average. What makes the distribution normal 
is that it follows this curved shape. Normal doesn’t describe a single data 
point, but a pattern of diversity. Many human traits, like height,
follow a normal distribution. Some people are very tall or very short, but most people fall close 
to the overall average. Outside of statistics, normal
often refers to an average— like the single number pulled 
from the fattest part of the bell curve— that eliminates all the nuance
of the normal distribution. Norma and Norman’s proportions
came from such averages. Applied to individuals, 
whether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely 
they hew to this average. At best, such definitions of normal 
fail to capture variation. But oftentimes, our calculations of normal
are even more flawed. Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index. BMI is a measure of weight
relative to height, with different ratios 
falling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,”
and “obese” ranges. Generally, only BMIs that correspond
to normal weight are considered healthy. But BMI is not always 
an accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight. BMI doesn’t take into account 
body fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical
activity, or blood pressure. And yet, those who fall outside
the so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing
or gaining weight will improve their health. When we apply a standard of normal
to all of humanity that’s based on data 
from a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one
point on the distribution, we’re choosing it 
from the wrong distribution. A lot of behavior science research draws
from samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, 
industrialized, rich, and democratic. These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have
an obvious link to them. Take the famed 
Muller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one 
of the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length. At least, it is if you’re
an American undergraduate. A team of anthropologists 
and psychologists found other demographic groups
were much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible 
to the illusion at all. When these limited or inaccurate
definitions of normal are used to make decisions 
that impact people’s lives, they can do real harm. Historically, such concepts of normal
have been hugely influential. The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th 
century weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, 
and even extermination of those deemed not normal. To this day, people are often targeted
and discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, 
mental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features
deemed “not normal.” But the reality is that the differences
in our bodies, minds, perceptions, and ideas about
the world around us— in short, diversity— 
is the true normal.

**Transcript**:
It was Christmas time in Camelot 
and King Arthur was throwing a party. The entire court was invited—
save the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay— and food and drink flowed freely. But in the midst of the revelry,
the castle doors split open. A towering knight riding an emerald
steed burst into the room, stunning the court into silence. Then, in a deep bellowing voice,
he proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him
with his own axe. If they could strike him down, 
they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed
to return that blow in one year and one day. Arthur and his knights were baffled. No man could survive such a strike. The Green Knight began to mock
their leader’s hesitance, and Arthur stood to defend his honor. But as soon as he gripped the axe,
another leapt to take his place. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain,
took the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded
the grinning knight. But the moment his skull met the ground,
it began to laugh. The Green Knight collected his head 
and mounted his horse. As he rode off, his severed head
reminded Gawain of their contract and told him to seek the Green Chapel
one year hence. In the months that followed, Gawain tried
to forget this bizarre vision. But despite the strangeness
of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably. When the following winter approached,
he set out— enduring foul weather 
and beastly encounters in his quest to find 
the mysterious Green Chapel. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he saw 
a shimmering castle on the horizon. The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled
to help such an honorable guest, and informed him that the Green Chapel
was only a short ride away. They implored Gawain to rest at their home
until his meeting with the Green Knight. Thrilled at this news, Gawain happily
accepted their offer. However, in exchange 
for their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go
hunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever
he’d gained during his day at the castle. At first, Gawain was perplexed
by these strange terms. But the lord’s meaning became quite clear
the next day, when his wife tried to seduce Gawain. To rebuff the lady’s advances 
without offending her honor, Gawain allowed one kiss— which he then passed on to her husband
in exchange for a slain dear. The next day, Gawain allowed two kisses,
which he gave to the lord for a dead boar. But on the third day, the lady offered
more than just three kisses. She presented a magical sash 
that would protect Gawain from the Green Knight’s blade. Gawain accepted immediately, 
but that evening, when the lord returned, the knight offered only three kisses 
with no mention of his enchanted gift. The next morning, Gawain rode 
out to the Green Chapel— a simple mound of earth where the Green Knight 
ominously sharpened an axe. With the sash’s protection, 
Gawain approached stoically— determined to honor his agreement. He bowed his head for the deadly blow,
and with a massive swing, the Green Knight cut Gawain’s neck— inflicting nothing more
than a flesh wound. Once more, Gawain was bewildered. Why hadn’t the sash protected him? And why hadn’t the knight 
killed him? Bursting into laughter, the Green Knight 
revealed himself to be the castle’s lord, and he’d been working with Morgan Le Fay to test the honor and bravery 
of Arthur’s knights. He was impressed with Gawain’s behavior, and he’d planned to spare 
his neck entirely— until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, 
Gawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, 
his companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor. Struggling to understand 
this strange journey, it seemed to Gawain that perhaps 
the whole world was playing a game— with rules more wild and bewildering
than any man could understand.

which he gave to the lord for a dead boar. But on the third day, the lady offered
more than just three kisses. She presented a magical sash 
that would protect Gawain from the Green Knight’s blade. Gawain accepted immediately, 
but that evening, when the lord returned, the knight offered only three kisses 
with no mention of his enchanted gift. The next morning, Gawain rode 
out to the Green Chapel— a simple mound of earth where the Green Knight 
ominously sharpened an axe. With the sash’s protection, 
Gawain approached stoically— determined to honor his agreement. He bowed his head for the deadly blow,
and with a massive swing, the Green Knight cut Gawain’s neck— inflicting nothing more
than a flesh wound. Once more, Gawain was bewildered. Why hadn’t the sash protected him? And why hadn’t the knight 
killed him? Bursting into laughter, the Green Knight 
revealed himself to be the castle’s lord, and he’d been working with Morgan Le Fay to test the honor and bravery 
of Arthur’s knights. He was impressed with Gawain’s behavior, and he’d planned to spare 
his neck entirely— until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, 
Gawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, 
his companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor. Struggling to understand 
this strange journey, it seemed to Gawain that perhaps 
the whole world was playing a game— with rules more wild and bewildering
than any man could understand.

**Transcript**:
It was Christmas time in Camelot 
and King Arthur was throwing a party. The entire court was invited—
save the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay— and food and drink flowed freely. But in the midst of the revelry,
the castle doors split open. A towering knight riding an emerald
steed burst into the room, stunning the court into silence. Then, in a deep bellowing voice,
he proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him
with his own axe. If they could strike him down, 
they would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed
to return that blow in one year and one day. Arthur and his knights were baffled. No man could survive such a strike. The Green Knight began to mock
their leader’s hesitance, and Arthur stood to defend his honor. But as soon as he gripped the axe,
another leapt to take his place. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain,
took the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded
the grinning knight. But the moment his skull met the ground,
it began to laugh. The Green Knight collected his head 
and mounted his horse. As he rode off, his severed head
reminded Gawain of their contract and told him to seek the Green Chapel
one year hence. In the months that followed, Gawain tried
to forget this bizarre vision. But despite the strangeness
of the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably. When the following winter approached,
he set out— enduring foul weather 
and beastly encounters in his quest to find 
the mysterious Green Chapel. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he saw 
a shimmering castle on the horizon. The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled
to help such an honorable guest, and informed him that the Green Chapel
was only a short ride away. They implored Gawain to rest at their home
until his meeting with the Green Knight. Thrilled at this news, Gawain happily
accepted their offer. However, in exchange 
for their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go
hunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever
he’d gained during his day at the castle. At first, Gawain was perplexed
by these strange terms. But the lord’s meaning became quite clear
the next day, when his wife tried to seduce Gawain. To rebuff the lady’s advances 
without offending her honor, Gawain allowed one kiss— which he then passed on to her husband
in exchange for a slain dear. The next day, Gawain allowed two kisses,
which he gave to the lord for a dead boar. But on the third day, the lady offered

**Transcript**:
Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,
and he’s turning... well... the issue 
is that you’ve forgotten. He’s older than 1, but beyond that,
he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your
forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared
a small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age
as the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count
the candles on the cake, but you're much too small
to see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made
an interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, 
you can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit
and brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see 
whether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,
in no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the 
dark you can’t tell its shape or size. You aren’t carrying anything with you,
and any marks you make will disappear. You need a strategy. How can you count the candles? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways 
to solve this problem. Let's start with the most straightforward. There’s exactly one way to mark
a location in the tunnel: the state of the candle. You can mark the first candle you reach 
by lighting it or keeping it on. If you walk forward, you’ll eventually
find another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one. The question is: how could you know which? Here’s one approach: turn it off 
and backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles 
you passed on the way there. If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop
and know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, 
continuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one 
and so on. This will work... eventually. But if the giant isn’t young,
and many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run
between now and sunrise. And you definitely don’t want to be 
in the cake when he starts digging in. So let’s look for a more 
efficient solution. How about testing a series of hypotheses
about the giant's age? Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, 
walk forward 10, switch or leave the destination 
candle off, and return. If the starting candle’s still on,
10 isn’t the answer. If it’s off, 10 could be right, 
but you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2
are also possibilities. Then you would have passed
a repeating pattern— but that could have just been
the starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles
on the way? If you turned them all on while walking 
from candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find 
would tell you the exact candle count. And if you don't hit any
extinguished candles, you'll know that the total
must be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess
and try again. To be systematic, you could increase 
your guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips 
and involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles. But you don’t have to increase
your guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, 
from 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number 
on your 5th trip after around 560 candles. Doubling allows you to reach
high numbers quickly, while starting with small intervals 
in case there are only a few candles. After expecting a lengthy trek, you’re pleased to discover 
the giant is only turning 12. You hurry to change into slightly
more inconspicuous clothing; chisel up some enormous chocolate numbers;
and at the party, make your own wish: that you’re not downwind when your friend 
blows out his candles.

**Transcript**:
Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,
and he’s turning... well... the issue 
is that you’ve forgotten. He’s older than 1, but beyond that,
he looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your
forgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared
a small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age
as the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count
the candles on the cake, but you're much too small
to see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made
an interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, 
you can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit
and brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see 
whether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,
in no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the 
dark you can’t tell its shape or size. You aren’t carrying anything with you,
and any marks you make will disappear. You need a strategy. How can you count the candles? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways 
to solve this problem. Let's start with the most straightforward. There’s exactly one way to mark
a location in the tunnel: the state of the candle. You can mark the first candle you reach 
by lighting it or keeping it on. If you walk forward, you’ll eventually
find another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one. The question is: how could you know which? Here’s one approach: turn it off 
and backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles 
you passed on the way there. If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop
and know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, 
continuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one 
and so on. This will work... eventually. But if the giant isn’t young,
and many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run
between now and sunrise. And you definitely don’t want to be 
in the cake when he starts digging in. So let’s look for a more 
efficient solution. How about testing a series of hypotheses
about the giant's age? Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, 
walk forward 10, switch or leave the destination 
candle off, and return. If the starting candle’s still on,
10 isn’t the answer. If it’s off, 10 could be right, 
but you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2
are also possibilities. Then you would have passed
a repeating pattern— but that could have just been
the starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles
on the way? If you turned them all on while walking 
from candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find 
would tell you the exact candle count. And if you don't hit any
extinguished candles, you'll know that the total
must be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess
and try again. To be systematic, you could increase 
your guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips 
and involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles. But you don’t have to increase
your guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, 
from 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number 
on your 5th trip after around 560 candles. Doubling allows you to reach
high numbers quickly, while starting with small intervals 
in case there are only a few candles. After expecting a lengthy trek, you’re pleased to discover 
the giant is only turning 12. You hurry to change into slightly
more inconspicuous clothing; chisel up some enormous chocolate numbers;
and at the party, make your own wish: that you’re not downwind when your friend 
blows out his candles.

**Transcript**:
Peering into the eyes 
of different animals, you’ll see some extraordinarily
shaped pupils. But why? It turns out that pupil shape 
is a powerful indicator of what role an animal plays 
in its ecosystem. Pupils mark the hollow opening
in the iris, the eye’s band of pigmented muscle. They’re the portholes through which
light enters the eye, where it then strikes the retina 
and activates light-sensitive cells, setting the process of vision in motion. Pupils are black because most of the
light that enters them is absorbed. Their size changes in response
to brightness, as well as certain drugs 
and emotional and mental states— but their basic form varies greatly
among species. House cats, for one, are twilight hunters 
with vertically elongated pupils. In the dark, these structures
expand dramatically, taking in the available light. When it’s bright, they shrink into slits. In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that
their maximum area is 135 times greater than their minimum area— whereas our pupils only shrink
and expand 15-fold. And because of how the slit pupil 
takes in light, it creates sharp, vertical contours. When the cat’s brain processes 
the visuals from each eye, the small but sharp differences 
between them help the cat judge 
the precise distance of its target. In fact, many other ambush hunters also
have vertically elongated pupils— but mainly those whose eyes are
located closer to the ground. This may be because these pupils are
especially useful in perceiving objects at the relative short distances
these animals tend to hunt. The world looks very different from behind
the horizontally elongated pupils of many grazing and browsing animals, 
like goats. These pupils, situated 
on either side of the head, let horizontal bands of light in that
give the goat a near-360-degree view and provide it with sharp,
horizontal images. This helps goats detect any
disruption to the horizon— alerting them to potential predators— 
while still enabling them to see ahead and detect obstacles 
as they make their escape. In fact, goats always keep their pupils
aligned with the horizon, rotating their eyeballs in their sockets
as they move their heads up and down. Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils
that shrink into slits studded with pinholes 
in higher light conditions. Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp
image onto the geckos retina. Scientists think that comparing 
these different inputs might help the gecko judge distance
without having to move. And while they might have fooled you, mantises and other insects and crustaceans
have “pseudopupils.” These aren’t optical structures; they’re optical illusions 
experienced by the observer. Mantises have compound eyes composed
of thousands of light-sensing units. When some are aimed at you,
they appear black because they’re absorbing most wavelengths
of incoming light— but there’s no actual opening. So, why do we have round pupils? Elongated pupils help sharpen certain
dimensions of an animal's vision. But scientists think that, for animals
like us with circular pupils, this is a lower priority. Instead of seeing some elements 
of a scene in extreme focus, we see a larger picture 
in relative detail, which enables more general skills 
of observation. This may be especially helpful
for foragers looking for food, hunters eyeballing and chasing
their prey, and social animals recognizing 
other faces. As we peer at different pupils, 
patterns emerge. And yet there are exceptions. For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses
are both small ambush predators, but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils
and mongooses have goat-like pupils. And we’ve only explored
a few pupil shapes. Other animals have crescent-
or heart-shaped pupils. And the cuttlefish has perhaps
some of the most bizarre: their pupils are circular in the dark,
but W-shaped in the light. So, what’s going on here? Well, wouldn’t we all like to know?

**Transcript**:
Peering into the eyes 
of different animals, you’ll see some extraordinarily
shaped pupils. But why? It turns out that pupil shape 
is a powerful indicator of what role an animal plays 
in its ecosystem. Pupils mark the hollow opening
in the iris, the eye’s band of pigmented muscle. They’re the portholes through which
light enters the eye, where it then strikes the retina 
and activates light-sensitive cells, setting the process of vision in motion. Pupils are black because most of the
light that enters them is absorbed. Their size changes in response
to brightness, as well as certain drugs 
and emotional and mental states— but their basic form varies greatly
among species. House cats, for one, are twilight hunters 
with vertically elongated pupils. In the dark, these structures
expand dramatically, taking in the available light. When it’s bright, they shrink into slits. In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that
their maximum area is 135 times greater than their minimum area— whereas our pupils only shrink
and expand 15-fold. And because of how the slit pupil 
takes in light, it creates sharp, vertical contours. When the cat’s brain processes 
the visuals from each eye, the small but sharp differences 
between them help the cat judge 
the precise distance of its target. In fact, many other ambush hunters also
have vertically elongated pupils— but mainly those whose eyes are
located closer to the ground. This may be because these pupils are
especially useful in perceiving objects at the relative short distances
these animals tend to hunt. The world looks very different from behind
the horizontally elongated pupils of many grazing and browsing animals, 
like goats. These pupils, situated 
on either side of the head, let horizontal bands of light in that
give the goat a near-360-degree view and provide it with sharp,
horizontal images. This helps goats detect any
disruption to the horizon— alerting them to potential predators— 
while still enabling them to see ahead and detect obstacles 
as they make their escape. In fact, goats always keep their pupils
aligned with the horizon, rotating their eyeballs in their sockets
as they move their heads up and down. Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils
that shrink into slits studded with pinholes 
in higher light conditions. Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp
image onto the geckos retina. Scientists think that comparing 
these different inputs might help the gecko judge distance
without having to move. And while they might have fooled you, mantises and other insects and crustaceans
have “pseudopupils.” These aren’t optical structures; they’re optical illusions 
experienced by the observer. Mantises have compound eyes composed
of thousands of light-sensing units. When some are aimed at you,
they appear black because they’re absorbing most wavelengths
of incoming light— but there’s no actual opening. So, why do we have round pupils? Elongated pupils help sharpen certain
dimensions of an animal's vision. But scientists think that, for animals
like us with circular pupils, this is a lower priority. Instead of seeing some elements 
of a scene in extreme focus, we see a larger picture 
in relative detail, which enables more general skills 
of observation. This may be especially helpful
for foragers looking for food, hunters eyeballing and chasing
their prey, and social animals recognizing 
other faces. As we peer at different pupils, 
patterns emerge. And yet there are exceptions. For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses
are both small ambush predators, but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils
and mongooses have goat-like pupils. And we’ve only explored
a few pupil shapes. Other animals have crescent-
or heart-shaped pupils. And the cuttlefish has perhaps
some of the most bizarre: their pupils are circular in the dark,
but W-shaped in the light. So, what’s going on here? Well, wouldn’t we all like to know?
