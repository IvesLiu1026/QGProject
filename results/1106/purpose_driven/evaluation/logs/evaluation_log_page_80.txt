**Transcript**:
Since 2000, the annual number of people
convicted of crimes in the United States has stayed steady, but the average number
of people in jail each year has shot up. How can that be? The answer lies in the bail system— which isn’t doing 
what it was intended to do. The term "bail" refers to the release
of people awaiting trial on condition that they return 
to court to face charges. Countries around the world 
use many variations of bail, and some don’t use it at all. The U.S. bail system relies primarily 
on what’s called cash bail, which was supposed to work like this: When a person was accused of a crime, the judge would set 
a reasonable price for bail. The accused would pay this fee 
in order to be released from jail until the court reached 
a verdict on the case. Once the case ended, 
whether found guilty or innocent, they’d get the bail money back 
if they made all their court appearances. The rationale behind this system 
is that under U.S. law, people are presumed innocent
until proven guilty— so someone accused of a crime 
should not be imprisoned unless they’ve been convicted of a crime. But today, the bail system in the U.S. doesn’t honor the presumption
of innocence. Instead, it subverts peoples’ rights
and causes serious harm, particularly to people 
in low-income communities and communities of color. A key reason why is the cost of bail. In order for cash bail 
to work as intended, the price has to be affordable
for the accused. The cost of bail wasn’t meant to reflect
the likelihood of someone’s guilt— when bail is set, the court 
has not reviewed evidence. Under exceptional circumstances, 
such as charges of very serious crimes, judges could deny bail 
and jail the accused before their trial. Judges were supposed to exercise 
this power very rarely, and could come under scrutiny
for using it too often. Setting unaffordably high bail 
became a second path to denying people pretrial release. Judges' personal discretion 
and prejudices played a huge role in who they chose to detain this way. Bail amounts climbed higher and higher, 
and more and more defendants couldn’t pay— so they stayed in jail. By the late 19th century, these circumstances led to the rise 
of commercial bail bond companies. They pay a defendant’s bail, in exchange
for a hefty fee the company keeps. Today, the median bail is $10,000— a prohibitively high price 
for almost half of Americans, and as many as nine out of ten defendants. If the defendant can’t pay, they may apply for a loan 
from a commercial bail bond company. It’s completely up to the company 
to decide whose bail they’ll pay. They choose defendants they think 
will pay them back, turning a profit of about
$2 billion each year. In fact, in the past 20 years, pretrial detention has been the main
driver of jail growth in America. Every year, hundreds of thousands 
of people who can’t afford bail or secure a loan
stay in jail until their case is resolved. This injustice disproportionately affects
Americans who are Black and Latino, for whom judges often set higher bail than for white people accused
of the same offenses. Unaffordable bail puts even innocent
defendants in an impossible position. Some end up pleading guilty to crimes 
they did not commit. For minor offenses, the prosecution 
may offer a deal that credits time already spent in jail toward 
the accused’s sentence if they plead guilty. Often, the time they’ve already spent in
jail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately—
but they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely
awaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee 
an innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary
in the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished
cash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94% 
of defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned
to all their court dates. The nonprofit organization, 
The Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands
of low-income people every year, removing the financial incentive
that bail is designed to create. The result? People come back 
to 90% of their court dates without having any money on the line, and those who miss their court dates 
tended to because of circumstances like child care,
work conflicts, or medical crises. Studies have also found that holding
people in jail before trial, often because they cannot
afford cash bail, actually increases the likelihood
of rearrests and reoffending. The damage of incarcerating people 
before their trials extends to entire communities
and can harm families for generations. People who are incarcerated 
can lose their livelihoods, homes, and access to essential services— all before they’ve been convicted 
of a crime. It’s also incredibly expensive: American taxpayers spend 
nearly $14 billion every year incarcerating people 
who are legally presumed innocent. This undermines the promise 
of equal justice under the law, regardless of race or wealth. The issues surrounding cash bail 
are symptomatic of societal problems, like structural racism and over-reliance
on incarceration, that need to be addressed. In the meantime, 
reformers like The Bail Project are working to help people trapped 
by cash bail and to create a more just and humane
pretrial system for the future.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: What is the intended purpose of setting a reasonable price for bail?

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about when cash bail is set during the legal process.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the most similar one based on the context and the topic of cash bail, I would suggest Question 3.

But since it's not a perfect match, I'll also provide an alternative solution. 

A potential match could be a new generated MCQ that is not in the list, but a similar question from the list is Question 2: What is the primary type of bail used in the U.S. bail system? This question is related to cash bail, and if a new question were generated based on this one, it could potentially match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose an index from the existing list, I would choose:

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the bail system and the concept of cash bail.

The ground truth MCQ asks about when you get cash bail back, and the correct option is "At the end of your case, whether you are found guilty or innocent, so long as you came back for your court dates."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest in terms of relevance to the concept of cash bail, but it does not directly address the issue of when you get cash bail back. However, it does mention the intended purpose of setting a reasonable price for bail, which is related to the idea of cash bail.

Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, but it is still not a direct match.

jail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately—
but they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely
awaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee 
an innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary
in the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished
cash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94% 
of defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned
to all their court dates. The nonprofit organization, 
The Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands
of low-income people every year, removing the financial incentive
that bail is designed to create. The result? People come back 
to 90% of their court dates without having any money on the line, and those who miss their court dates 
tended to because of circumstances like child care,
work conflicts, or medical crises. Studies have also found that holding
people in jail before trial, often because they cannot
afford cash bail, actually increases the likelihood
of rearrests and reoffending. The damage of incarcerating people 
before their trials extends to entire communities
and can harm families for generations. People who are incarcerated 
can lose their livelihoods, homes, and access to essential services— all before they’ve been convicted 
of a crime. It’s also incredibly expensive: American taxpayers spend 
nearly $14 billion every year incarcerating people 
who are legally presumed innocent. This undermines the promise 
of equal justice under the law, regardless of race or wealth. The issues surrounding cash bail 
are symptomatic of societal problems, like structural racism and over-reliance
on incarceration, that need to be addressed. In the meantime, 
reformers like The Bail Project are working to help people trapped 
by cash bail and to create a more just and humane
pretrial system for the future.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What is the intended purpose of setting a reasonable price for bail?

Although the question phrasing is not identical, the intent and content of Question 3 align with the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ is that cash bail should be based on how much money the accused can afford, which is implied in the correct answer to Question 3 (not explicitly provided, but based on the context of the transcript, it should be "to ensure the accused appears in court" without being overly burdensome).

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly addresses how cash bail is supposed to be determined. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would recommend Question 3 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Since 2000, the annual number of people
convicted of crimes in the United States has stayed steady, but the average number
of people in jail each year has shot up. How can that be? The answer lies in the bail system— which isn’t doing 
what it was intended to do. The term "bail" refers to the release
of people awaiting trial on condition that they return 
to court to face charges. Countries around the world 
use many variations of bail, and some don’t use it at all. The U.S. bail system relies primarily 
on what’s called cash bail, which was supposed to work like this: When a person was accused of a crime, the judge would set 
a reasonable price for bail. The accused would pay this fee 
in order to be released from jail until the court reached 
a verdict on the case. Once the case ended, 
whether found guilty or innocent, they’d get the bail money back 
if they made all their court appearances. The rationale behind this system 
is that under U.S. law, people are presumed innocent
until proven guilty— so someone accused of a crime 
should not be imprisoned unless they’ve been convicted of a crime. But today, the bail system in the U.S. doesn’t honor the presumption
of innocence. Instead, it subverts peoples’ rights
and causes serious harm, particularly to people 
in low-income communities and communities of color. A key reason why is the cost of bail. In order for cash bail 
to work as intended, the price has to be affordable
for the accused. The cost of bail wasn’t meant to reflect
the likelihood of someone’s guilt— when bail is set, the court 
has not reviewed evidence. Under exceptional circumstances, 
such as charges of very serious crimes, judges could deny bail 
and jail the accused before their trial. Judges were supposed to exercise 
this power very rarely, and could come under scrutiny
for using it too often. Setting unaffordably high bail 
became a second path to denying people pretrial release. Judges' personal discretion 
and prejudices played a huge role in who they chose to detain this way. Bail amounts climbed higher and higher, 
and more and more defendants couldn’t pay— so they stayed in jail. By the late 19th century, these circumstances led to the rise 
of commercial bail bond companies. They pay a defendant’s bail, in exchange
for a hefty fee the company keeps. Today, the median bail is $10,000— a prohibitively high price 
for almost half of Americans, and as many as nine out of ten defendants. If the defendant can’t pay, they may apply for a loan 
from a commercial bail bond company. It’s completely up to the company 
to decide whose bail they’ll pay. They choose defendants they think 
will pay them back, turning a profit of about
$2 billion each year. In fact, in the past 20 years, pretrial detention has been the main
driver of jail growth in America. Every year, hundreds of thousands 
of people who can’t afford bail or secure a loan
stay in jail until their case is resolved. This injustice disproportionately affects
Americans who are Black and Latino, for whom judges often set higher bail than for white people accused
of the same offenses. Unaffordable bail puts even innocent
defendants in an impossible position. Some end up pleading guilty to crimes 
they did not commit. For minor offenses, the prosecution 
may offer a deal that credits time already spent in jail toward 
the accused’s sentence if they plead guilty. Often, the time they’ve already spent in
jail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately—
but they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely
awaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee 
an innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary
in the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished
cash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94% 
of defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned
to all their court dates. The nonprofit organization, 
The Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands

**Transcript**:
Emotional abuse can be
incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances 
of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves
one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth
and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be
subtle and difficult to spot, both from within 
and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse
often exploits or creates power imbalances 
between individuals, especially in relationships
where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between
a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,
teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because 
it often makes people doubt their perceptions 
of their own mistreatment. So let’s walk through some of the most
common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns
easier to spot in real life. First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion
to a situation, excessively harsh or personal,
or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions 
for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make
such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” 
and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; 
they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt
through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,
glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone
or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns 
of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements 
that might otherwise seem benign. Third, how someone reacts
to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful 
can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely 
and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize
the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try 
to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred 
to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,
humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss
the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you 
improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish 
and manipulative— you’re hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. Lastly, when someone directs any 
of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part 
of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling
or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have 
a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors
occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, 
whether days or years, can contribute 
to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember 
that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm 
don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle
of emotional manipulation. So what can you do if you think you
or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people
other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate 
their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing
emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences
with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national
confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know
is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen
whenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince
people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves
kindness and respect.

of their own mistreatment. So let’s walk through some of the most
common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns
easier to spot in real life. First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion
to a situation, excessively harsh or personal,
or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions 
for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make
such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” 
and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; 
they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt
through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,
glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone
or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns 
of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements 
that might otherwise seem benign. Third, how someone reacts
to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful 
can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely 
and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize
the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try 
to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred 
to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,
humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss
the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you 
improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish 
and manipulative— you’re hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. Lastly, when someone directs any 
of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part 
of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling
or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have 
a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors
occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, 
whether days or years, can contribute 
to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember 
that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm 
don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle
of emotional manipulation. So what can you do if you think you
or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people
other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate 
their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing
emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences
with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national
confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know
is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen
whenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince
people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves
kindness and respect.

Emotional abuse can be
incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances 
of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves
one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth
and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be
subtle and difficult to spot, both from within 
and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse
often exploits or creates power imbalances 
between individuals, especially in relationships
where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between
a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,
teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the components of emotional abuse, specifically the content of someone's words and tone and nonverbal cues. Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 partially matches this intent, as it asks about a warning sign of emotional abuse related to the content of someone's words (criticism that is out of proportion to a situation).

However, since Question 5 does not explicitly mention tone and nonverbal cues, I must admit that there is no perfect match among the generated MCQs. Nevertheless, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would suggest:

 Question 5

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that explicitly asks about both the content of someone's words and tone and nonverbal cues as components of emotional abuse.

**Transcript**:
It's 4 a.m., 
and the big test is in eight hours, followed by a piano recital. You've been studying and playing for days,
but you still don't feel ready for either. So, what can you do? Well, you can drink another cup of coffee and spend the next few hours 
cramming and practicing, but believe it or not, you might be better off closing the books,
putting away the music, and going to sleep. Sleep occupies nearly 
a third of our lives, but many of us give surprisingly
little attention and care to it. This neglect is often the result 
of a major misunderstanding. Sleep isn't lost time, or just a way to rest 
when all our important work is done. Instead, it's a critical function, during which your body balances
and regulates its vital systems, affecting respiration and regulating everything from circulation
to growth and immune response. That's great, but you can worry about 
all those things after this test, right? Well, not so fast. It turns out that sleep 
is also crucial for your brain, with a fifth of your body's 
circulatory blood being channeled to it as you drift off. And what goes on 
in your brain while you sleep is an intensely active period 
of restructuring that's crucial for how our memory works. At first glance, our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all. 19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material within the first twenty minutes, a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve. But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation, the process by which
information is moved from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory. This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain, known as the hippocampus. Its role in long-term memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner in her research with 
a patient known as H.M. After having his hippocampus removed, H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged, but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition. Due to the removal of his hippocampus, H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged. What this case revealed,
among other things, was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory, such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test, rather than procedural memory, such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital. Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's, have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works. Sensory data is initially transcribed and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory. From there, it travels to the hippocampus, which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area. Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity, new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons, and strengthening the neural network where the information will be returned
as long-term memory. So why do we remember
some things and not others? Well, there are a few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention. For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling, or even stress, will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion. But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is, you guessed it, a good night's sleep. Sleep is composed of four stages, the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement. EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages have shown electrical impulses moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation. And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate different types of memories. During the non-REM slow-wave sleep, declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store in the anterior part of the hippocampus. Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus, it is then repeatedly reactivated, driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex. REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity, is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory. So based on the studies, going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal. So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep not only harms your long-term health, but actually makes it less likely that you'll retain all that knowledge
and practice from the previous night, all of which just goes to affirm
the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it." When you think about 
all the internal restructuring and forming of new connections
that occurs while you slumber, you could even say that proper sleep will have you waking up every morning
with a new and improved brain, ready to face the challenges ahead.

cramming and practicing, but believe it or not, you might be better off closing the books,
putting away the music, and going to sleep. Sleep occupies nearly 
a third of our lives, but many of us give surprisingly
little attention and care to it. This neglect is often the result 
of a major misunderstanding. Sleep isn't lost time, or just a way to rest 
when all our important work is done. Instead, it's a critical function, during which your body balances
and regulates its vital systems, affecting respiration and regulating everything from circulation
to growth and immune response. That's great, but you can worry about 
all those things after this test, right? Well, not so fast. It turns out that sleep 
is also crucial for your brain, with a fifth of your body's 
circulatory blood being channeled to it as you drift off. And what goes on 
in your brain while you sleep is an intensely active period 
of restructuring that's crucial for how our memory works. At first glance, our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all. 19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material within the first twenty minutes, a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve. But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation, the process by which
information is moved from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory. This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain, known as the hippocampus. Its role in long-term memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner in her research with 
a patient known as H.M. After having his hippocampus removed, H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged, but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition. Due to the removal of his hippocampus, H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged. What this case revealed,
among other things, was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory, such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test, rather than procedural memory, such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital. Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's, have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works. Sensory data is initially transcribed and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory. From there, it travels to the hippocampus, which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area. Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity, new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons, and strengthening the neural network where the information will be returned
as long-term memory. So why do we remember
some things and not others? Well, there are a few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention. For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling, or even stress, will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion. But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is, you guessed it, a good night's sleep. Sleep is composed of four stages, the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement. EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages have shown electrical impulses moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation. And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate different types of memories. During the non-REM slow-wave sleep, declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store in the anterior part of the hippocampus. Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus, it is then repeatedly reactivated, driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex. REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity, is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory. So based on the studies, going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal. So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep not only harms your long-term health, but actually makes it less likely that you'll retain all that knowledge
and practice from the previous night, all of which just goes to affirm
the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it." When you think about 
all the internal restructuring and forming of new connections
that occurs while you slumber, you could even say that proper sleep will have you waking up every morning
with a new and improved brain, ready to face the challenges ahead.

**Transcript**:
Your favorite athlete 
closes in for a victorious win. The crowd holds its breath, and, at the crucial moment,
she misses the shot. That competitor just experienced 
the phenomenon known as "choking," where despite months, 
even years, of practice, a person fails right when it matters most. Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs 
under intense pressure and depends on key moments. And yet, performance anxiety 
also haunts public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and even world-famous musicians. Most people intuitively
blame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous 
undermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily, choking 
under pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers 
when the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention
on performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts 
compete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process 
so much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental “scratch pad” we use to temporarily store phone numbers 
and grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to pressure. In a 2004 study, 
a group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex 
and memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem
types with nothing at stake, while the others completed them 
when calm and under pressure. While everyone did well 
on the easy problems, those who were stressed 
performed worse on the more difficult, 
memory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up 
the second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They’re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze
the task at hand. Here, the logic goes that 
once a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics 
interferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be
most vulnerable to this kind of choking. A study on competitive golfers compared 
their performance when instructed to simply focus on
putting as accurately as possible, versus when they were primed 
to be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke. Golfers usually perform 
this action subconsciously, so those who suddenly tuned in 
to the precise details of their own moves also became worse 
at making accurate shots. Choking may not be inevitable 
for everyone though. Research suggests that some are
more susceptible than others, especially those who are self-conscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged 
negatively by others. So, how can we avoid choking 
when it really counts? First, it helps to practice 
under stressful conditions. In a study on expert dart players, researchers found that those 
who hadn’t practiced under stress performed worse when anxious, compared to those who had 
become accustomed to pressure. Secondly, many performers extol the 
virtues of a pre-performance routine, whether it’s taking a few deep breaths, repeating a cue word, or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements. Studies on golfing, bowling, 
and water polo find that short rituals can lead 
to more consistent and accurate performance under pressure. And thirdly, researchers have shown that having an external focus 
on the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus, where someone is tuned into the mechanics 
of what they’re doing. A study of experienced golfers revealed 
that those who hit chip shots while focused on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those
who focused on the motion of their arms. So, perhaps we can modify 
that age-old saying: practice, under pressure, with focus, and with that glorious end goal in sight, makes perfect.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the level at which "choking" generally occurs among athletes, musicians, and other performers. The closest generated MCQ in terms of relevance is Question 5, which asks about the type of tasks that are especially vulnerable to pressure. However, this question does not directly address the level at which "choking" occurs.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 5

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to be focused on the causes and effects of "choking" under pressure, whereas the ground truth MCQ is asking about the level at which it occurs. Therefore, none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the wording of Question 7 is not identical to the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are similar. Question 7 asks about the primary cause of performance suffering under pressure according to explicit monitoring theories, and the correct answer is "Overanalyzing the task at hand." This aligns with the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the prediction of explicit monitoring theories regarding choking and has a correct answer that involves paying close attention to the mechanics of the task (in this case, throwing a dart).

However, an even more similar generated MCQ would be one that specifically asks about the prediction of explicit monitoring theories regarding choking, with options that involve paying close attention to the mechanics of the task. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

**Transcript**:
Your favorite athlete 
closes in for a victorious win. The crowd holds its breath, and, at the crucial moment,
she misses the shot. That competitor just experienced 
the phenomenon known as "choking," where despite months, 
even years, of practice, a person fails right when it matters most. Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs 
under intense pressure and depends on key moments. And yet, performance anxiety 
also haunts public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and even world-famous musicians. Most people intuitively
blame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous 
undermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily, choking 
under pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers 
when the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention
on performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts 
compete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process 
so much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental “scratch pad” we use to temporarily store phone numbers 
and grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to pressure. In a 2004 study, 
a group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex 
and memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem
types with nothing at stake, while the others completed them 
when calm and under pressure. While everyone did well 
on the easy problems, those who were stressed 
performed worse on the more difficult, 
memory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up 
the second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They’re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze
the task at hand. Here, the logic goes that 
once a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics 
interferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be
most vulnerable to this kind of choking. A study on competitive golfers compared 
their performance when instructed to simply focus on
putting as accurately as possible, versus when they were primed 
to be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke. Golfers usually perform 
this action subconsciously, so those who suddenly tuned in 
to the precise details of their own moves also became worse 
at making accurate shots. Choking may not be inevitable 
for everyone though. Research suggests that some are
more susceptible than others, especially those who are self-conscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged 
negatively by others. So, how can we avoid choking 
when it really counts? First, it helps to practice 
under stressful conditions. In a study on expert dart players, researchers found that those 
who hadn’t practiced under stress performed worse when anxious, compared to those who had 
become accustomed to pressure. Secondly, many performers extol the 
virtues of a pre-performance routine, whether it’s taking a few deep breaths, repeating a cue word, or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements. Studies on golfing, bowling, 
and water polo find that short rituals can lead 
to more consistent and accurate performance under pressure. And thirdly, researchers have shown that having an external focus 
on the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus, where someone is tuned into the mechanics 
of what they’re doing. A study of experienced golfers revealed 
that those who hit chip shots while focused on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those
who focused on the motion of their arms. So, perhaps we can modify 
that age-old saying: practice, under pressure, with focus, and with that glorious end goal in sight, makes perfect.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, 
the discovery of two new drugs sparked what would become a multibillion 
dollar market for antidepressants. Neither drug was intended 
to treat depression at all— in fact, at the time, many doctors 
and scientists believed psychotherapy was the only approach 
to treating depression. The decades-long journey of discovery
that followed revolutionized our understanding 
of depression— and raised questions 
we hadn’t considered before. One of those first two antidepressant
drugs was ipronaizid, which was intended to treat tuberculosis. In a 1952 trial, 
it not only treated tuberculosis, it also improved the moods of patients who had previously been diagnosed 
with depression. In 1956, a Swiss clinician observed 
a similar effect when running a trial for imipramine, 
a drug for allergic reactions. Both drugs affected a class 
of neurotransmitters called monoamines. The discovery of these 
antidepressant drugs gave rise 
to the chemical imbalance theory, the idea that depression is caused
by having insufficient monoamines in the brain’s synapses. Ipronaizid, imipramine, 
and other drugs like them were thought to restore that balance by increasing the availability 
of monoamines in the brain. These drugs targeted several
different monoamines, each of which acted on a wide range
of receptors in the brain. This often meant a lot of side effects, including headaches, grogginess, 
and cognitive impairments including difficulty with memory, 
thinking, and judgment. Hoping to make the drugs more targeted 
and reduce side effects, scientists began studying existing 
antidepressants to figure out which specific monoamines 
were most associated with improvements in depression. In the 1970s, several different
researchers converged on an answer: the most effective antidepressants 
all seemed to act on one monoamine called serotonin. This discovery led to the production
of fluoxetine, or Prozac, in 1988. It was the first of a new class of drugs called Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI’s, which block the reabsorption of serotonin,
leaving more available in the brain. Prozac worked well 
and had fewer side effects than older, less targeted antidepressants. The makers of Prozac also worked 
to market the drug by raising awareness 
of the dangers of depression to both the public 
and the medical community. More people came to see depression 
as a disease caused by mechanisms beyond 
an individual’s control, which reduced the culture of blame 
and stigmatization surrounding depression, and more people sought help. In the 1990s, the number of people being
treated for depression skyrocketed. Psychotherapy and other treatments
fell by the wayside, and most people were treated 
solely with antidepressant drugs. Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced
view of how to treat depression— and of what causes it. Not everyone with depression responds 
to SSRIs like Prozac— some respond better to drugs 
that act on other neurotransmitters, or don't respond to medication at all. For many, a combination 
of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs is more effective than either alone. We’re also not sure why antidepressants
work the way they do: they change monoamine levels within
a few hours of taking the medication, but patients usually don’t feel
the benefit until weeks later. And after they stop 
taking antidepressants, some patients never experience 
depression again, while others relapse. We now recognize that we don’t
know what causes depression, or why anti-depressants work. The chemical imbalance theory 
is at best an incomplete explanation. It can’t be a coincidence that almost all
the antidepressants happen to act on serotonin, but that doesn’t mean serotonin deficiency
is the cause of depression. If that sounds odd, 
consider a more straightforward example: steroid creams can treat rashes
caused by poison ivy— the fact that they work doesn’t mean
steroid deficiency was the cause of the rash. We still have a ways to go in terms 
of understanding this disease. Fortunately, in the meantime, 
we have effective tools to treat it.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the common side effects of early antidepressants. The most similar generated MCQ is not present in the provided options, as none of them directly ask about the side effects of early antidepressants. However, Question 3 mentions the chemical imbalance theory, which is related to the mechanism of action of early antidepressants, but it does not ask about side effects.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it is still not a good match.

However, I can suggest a better approach. Since the generated MCQs do not directly ask about the side effects of early antidepressants, we can look for questions that mention the effects or mechanisms of early antidepressants.

In this case, I would recommend Question 3, but with a note that it is not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly ask about the side effects of early antidepressants.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, 
the discovery of two new drugs sparked what would become a multibillion 
dollar market for antidepressants. Neither drug was intended 
to treat depression at all— in fact, at the time, many doctors 
and scientists believed psychotherapy was the only approach 
to treating depression. The decades-long journey of discovery
that followed revolutionized our understanding 
of depression— and raised questions 
we hadn’t considered before. One of those first two antidepressant
drugs was ipronaizid, which was intended to treat tuberculosis. In a 1952 trial, 
it not only treated tuberculosis, it also improved the moods of patients who had previously been diagnosed 
with depression. In 1956, a Swiss clinician observed 
a similar effect when running a trial for imipramine, 
a drug for allergic reactions. Both drugs affected a class 
of neurotransmitters called monoamines. The discovery of these 
antidepressant drugs gave rise 
to the chemical imbalance theory, the idea that depression is caused
by having insufficient monoamines in the brain’s synapses. Ipronaizid, imipramine, 
and other drugs like them were thought to restore that balance by increasing the availability 
of monoamines in the brain. These drugs targeted several
different monoamines, each of which acted on a wide range
of receptors in the brain. This often meant a lot of side effects, including headaches, grogginess, 
and cognitive impairments including difficulty with memory, 
thinking, and judgment. Hoping to make the drugs more targeted 
and reduce side effects, scientists began studying existing 
antidepressants to figure out which specific monoamines 
were most associated with improvements in depression. In the 1970s, several different
researchers converged on an answer: the most effective antidepressants 
all seemed to act on one monoamine called serotonin. This discovery led to the production
of fluoxetine, or Prozac, in 1988. It was the first of a new class of drugs called Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI’s, which block the reabsorption of serotonin,
leaving more available in the brain. Prozac worked well 
and had fewer side effects than older, less targeted antidepressants. The makers of Prozac also worked 
to market the drug by raising awareness 
of the dangers of depression to both the public 
and the medical community. More people came to see depression 
as a disease caused by mechanisms beyond 
an individual’s control, which reduced the culture of blame 
and stigmatization surrounding depression, and more people sought help. In the 1990s, the number of people being
treated for depression skyrocketed. Psychotherapy and other treatments
fell by the wayside, and most people were treated 
solely with antidepressant drugs. Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced
view of how to treat depression— and of what causes it. Not everyone with depression responds 
to SSRIs like Prozac— some respond better to drugs 
that act on other neurotransmitters, or don't respond to medication at all. For many, a combination 
of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs is more effective than either alone. We’re also not sure why antidepressants
work the way they do: they change monoamine levels within
a few hours of taking the medication, but patients usually don’t feel
the benefit until weeks later. And after they stop 
taking antidepressants, some patients never experience 
depression again, while others relapse. We now recognize that we don’t
know what causes depression, or why anti-depressants work. The chemical imbalance theory 
is at best an incomplete explanation. It can’t be a coincidence that almost all
the antidepressants happen to act on serotonin, but that doesn’t mean serotonin deficiency
is the cause of depression. If that sounds odd, 
consider a more straightforward example: steroid creams can treat rashes
caused by poison ivy— the fact that they work doesn’t mean
steroid deficiency was the cause of the rash. We still have a ways to go in terms 
of understanding this disease. Fortunately, in the meantime, 
we have effective tools to treat it.

**Transcript**:
Each person who entered our therapy clinic answer a stack of questions
before beginning treatment. And during my years as a therapist there, there was one question I always reviewed
before meeting with a new client. It asked this: What is your purpose in life? Defined as a central motivating life aim,
something you're trying to accomplish. Now, to be fair,
this is a difficult question. Identifying a single purpose
in life feels really hard. It also feels consequential. Many people spend years searching for
and developing their purposes, and some never find it. But typically we see responses like this: to be an engaged parent, to make meaningful change in my community, to build a career I'm proud of, to live for a long time,
just keeping it simple. But then there was the answer
of one young woman who I worked with. Before meeting with her, as I always did, I flipped to see
how she described her purpose. And she wrote this: "To avoid being noticed by other people." This young woman, a bright, witty,
compassionate high schooler, decided that her purpose in life was to make sure that other people
did not know that she existed. This is the power of social anxiety. At its core, social anxiety
is about the fear of being rejected. When we feel socially anxious, we become hyper-focused
on how we are appearing to others. We scan the room looking for signs
of threat and disapproval, signs we might have slipped up
and are at risk for rejection. And then we seek comfort
in signs of approval, smiles, head nods, laughs and so on. And while social anxiety
can be exhausting, it exists for a reason. Social anxiety tries
to protect us from rejection, and it does that by tuning us in
to the nuances and norms and dynamics of a social group so we can match our behavior
to fit in with them and ultimately avoid being rejected. This is a good thing
because humans are social. We exist in social groups, we rely on each other
whether or not we like that, but also more simply
because rejection is painful. Take a moment to think
about your own rejection experiences, however cringeworthy, we all have them. Maybe you were ghosted after a first date. Been there. Maybe you were rejected
from your dream job. Maybe you were ousted from a friend group. Rejection's unpleasant. And social anxiety
tries to protect us from it. But social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere
with the life you want to live. And this happens
when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined
with your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have
some inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not
lovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not
intelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not
interesting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really
a fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe
society wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop
into social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned
about other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly
and ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct
their lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being
noticed by other people, then those people have fewer data
points on which to reject you. Now, social anxiety disorder is one of the most common
mental illnesses in the world. In the United States alone, more than 12 percent of Americans
at some point in their lives will have diagnosable
social anxiety disorder. That's roughly 40 million people. Now worldwide, the estimates
are lower, they're four percent, which in and of itself is interesting. But based on current population estimates, four percent of the world
is roughly 300 million people that will potentially have
social anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. And despite how prevalent it is,
it's widely misunderstood, widely misdiagnosed and often missed entirely. This is because several myths
about social anxiety pervade our culture. The first myth is that people
with social anxiety are happier alone. The stereotype of someone
with social anxiety as a recluse who'd rather be hiding away
alone in their bedroom than out interacting with the world. And this is simply not true. In research conducted in my lab, we find that people
with social anxiety disorder desire strong, healthy,
intimate relationships to the same degree
as those without mental illness. And they do socialize, they’re not robotic aliens. And when they socialize, they often enjoy doing so. In fact, when we ask people
with social anxiety how happy they are, they report feeling happier
when they are with other people than when they're alone. This is because not all social
interactions are stressful. Maybe someone feels
socially anxious with friends but not their romantic partner. Or they feel anxious with strangers
and acquaintances but not people like their
neighbors or coworkers. So even though some
interactions are stressful, people with social anxiety are not devoid
of the basic desire for human connection. They just have trouble obtaining it
in certain situations with certain people. OK, so maybe then people
with social anxiety do socialize, and when they do, they enjoy it. But it's with a small,
tight-knit group of people. And really, social anxiety is about
avoiding the spotlight. And this is the second myth. Social anxiety is not necessarily
about a fear of public performance. While this is true of some people, other people with social anxiety
find performing in front of others less anxiety-provoking than smaller, more intimate conversations, like when they have to carry
a conversation one on one. Many people with social anxiety
excel in careers that are intertwined with social
evaluation and social performance. Modeling, acting, sports. In May of 2021, Naomi Osaka declined to participate
in press conferences of the French Open. She courageously and preemptively shared that they exacerbated her social anxiety. Shortly thereafter, she received a wave
of public backlash and scrutiny. She goes on to play her first match, of course, wins, and then she withdraws
from the French Open. Many people were perplexed about how someone
could have social anxiety and also be the number one ranked
tennis player in the world, lead a fashion campaign
with Nike -- good choice -- and don the cover of Sports
Illustrated in a swimsuit. In an interview the year prior
discussing her social anxiety, Osaka explained: "On the court is completely different. I love playing at Arthur Ashe
because it’s the biggest stadium, and you feel the rumble of the crowd. You kind of feel like a gladiator
because it’s super-big and there are so many people
watching your match. But off the court, if I was ever thrown into a situation where I had to speak
in front of 100 people, I feel like I would start shaking." There is no one-size-fits-all
profile of social anxiety. Just like people who are depressed
have different collections of symptoms at different times for different reasons, social anxiety looks different
in different people. And last and maybe
the most problematic myth. That social anxiety
is fleeting and harmless. Social anxiety is not just
something you grow out of. It doesn't magically disappear when you graduate
middle school or high school. Without intervention, many people struggle
with social anxiety for years, for decades. And social anxiety can influence
every aspect of a person's life. It can influence the hobbies they choose, maybe opting for solo activities
like reading, writing, rather than things like team sports. It can influence
the careers people pursue. Maybe opting for careers
with more individual, like computer time, versus things like sales
or customer service. And social anxiety could influence
people's everyday lives. Ricky Williams, star NFL running back, Heisman-winning running back, dazzled millions of people
on the football field every week. And yet he shared that he struggled
with social anxiety, and because of it, he had difficulty interacting
with teammates, running everyday errands where he'd have to interact with people and even interacting
with his own daughter. The real tragedy of social anxiety is that it robs individuals
of their greatest resource: other people. Other people help us overcome adversity, like recovering from illness
or after you bomb a job interview. Other people help us celebrate milestones like showing up to the birth of our child
or a wedding or a graduation. And other people help us overcome loss, like grieving the death of a loved one. Our fear of rejection gets in the way
of obtaining and appreciating the benefits of being accepted,
the benefits of other people. And in our modern world, it is harder than ever
to manage social anxiety. We are more connected today
than any time in human history, and yet we are lonelier, more depressed and more socially anxious than ever. We have endless tools to socialize, and yet we're seeing
a decaying social connection. In a rapid amount of time, our social structures have been
upended and rewritten. Technology and social media
have created new standards for social relationships and interactions: "Do I post it, do I share it,
do I like it, do I love it?" We create these bizarre
extensions of ourselves through curated profiles and now avatars. We try to make sense of unlimited feedback from a massive and often
invisible audience. And the costs of social
blunders are higher. Things you do and things you say
can live online forever and subject you to unforgiving scrutiny, reputation loss and even job loss. It is a tough time to have social anxiety. But the world will become more,
not less, connected, and the influence of technology
and social media will grow, not shrink. Now is the time to address social anxiety. And here's how. The first and maybe easiest thing
we can do is identify early. Early detection is critical because of those who go on
to develop social anxiety disorder, more than half will have developed it
before their 14th birthday. More than half. And social anxiety puts people at risk for developing other
mental illnesses later on. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression, social anxiety came first
70 percent of the time. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, social anxiety came first. It was developed first approximately
80 percent of the time. What these data suggests
is that social anxiety starts early, and it puts people at risk
for developing other mental illnesses. But here's the incredible part. Social anxiety can be reliably
and accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions. Questions like: "Is your fear of rejection
among one of your worst fears?" And "Does your fear of rejection
get in the way of doing things that you'd otherwise
want to be or enjoy doing?" The cost of asking these questions
is like 30 seconds and zero dollars. We don't have to create
new infrastructures. We don't have to upend existing ones. We can embed early detection programs
into our existing structures like at schools, new year orientation, one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings. Because if a doctor
can screen for depression, then she can also screen
for social anxiety. Early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter
the trajectories of young people. The second thing we can do
is harness our platforms. One of the benefits of living
in this hyperconnected world is that a single person
can have a ton of power. They can use their platforms to create
meaningful and lasting social change. I mentioned Ricky Williams and Osaka, who have used their platforms to share
about their social anxiety. And just from these two people,
we’ve seen a ripple effect. In response to Osaka's announcement, Viola Davis, Oscar, Emmy, Tony-award winning actress, shared that she struggles
with social anxiety. A woman whose job it is as an actress to embody and express
the complexities of people in very vulnerable and very public ways. But frankly, these celebrities are not
the poster children for social anxiety. They're just three
of the millions who suffer, who were brave enough to talk about it. And we can do the same with our platforms,
however big or small. In our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities and in our homes. Because regular, candid and forthcoming
conversations about mental illness ultimately reduce stigma, correct harmful myths and get people the help that they need. The last thing that we can do
is foster social courage. Addressing social anxiety is not
about preventing or avoiding rejection. Addressing social anxiety
is about fostering social courage. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences and knowing that your chances
of rejection are not zero. In fact, the chances that you get rejected
at some point in your life, at some point this year, are high. And worse, you may be rejected
as a function of who you are. Things about yourself
that you cannot change. Where you come from, what you look like or who you love. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences because they are important to you and knowing that the successes
of those pursuits are not contingent
on your worth as a human being. Being socially courageous
means knowing your worth and finding people and social groups that love and accept that person. And being socially courageous
means asking that person out, applying for that job, speaking up at that meeting or that party or giving that big talk on that big stage, knowing that rejection lurks
around the corner. But the opportunity for growth
and for purpose shines brighter. A purpose not defined by ensuring
that you go unnoticed in this world, but a purpose that makes you feel
most alive, most present and most authentically you. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Each person who entered our therapy clinic answer a stack of questions
before beginning treatment. And during my years as a therapist there, there was one question I always reviewed
before meeting with a new client. It asked this: What is your purpose in life? Defined as a central motivating life aim,
something you're trying to accomplish. Now, to be fair,
this is a difficult question. Identifying a single purpose
in life feels really hard. It also feels consequential. Many people spend years searching for
and developing their purposes, and some never find it. But typically we see responses like this: to be an engaged parent, to make meaningful change in my community, to build a career I'm proud of, to live for a long time,
just keeping it simple. But then there was the answer
of one young woman who I worked with. Before meeting with her, as I always did, I flipped to see
how she described her purpose. And she wrote this: "To avoid being noticed by other people." This young woman, a bright, witty,
compassionate high schooler, decided that her purpose in life was to make sure that other people
did not know that she existed. This is the power of social anxiety. At its core, social anxiety
is about the fear of being rejected. When we feel socially anxious, we become hyper-focused
on how we are appearing to others. We scan the room looking for signs
of threat and disapproval, signs we might have slipped up
and are at risk for rejection. And then we seek comfort
in signs of approval, smiles, head nods, laughs and so on. And while social anxiety
can be exhausting, it exists for a reason. Social anxiety tries
to protect us from rejection, and it does that by tuning us in
to the nuances and norms and dynamics of a social group so we can match our behavior
to fit in with them and ultimately avoid being rejected. This is a good thing
because humans are social. We exist in social groups, we rely on each other
whether or not we like that, but also more simply
because rejection is painful. Take a moment to think
about your own rejection experiences, however cringeworthy, we all have them. Maybe you were ghosted after a first date. Been there. Maybe you were rejected
from your dream job. Maybe you were ousted from a friend group. Rejection's unpleasant. And social anxiety
tries to protect us from it. But social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere
with the life you want to live. And this happens
when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined
with your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have
some inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not
lovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not
intelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not
interesting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really
a fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe
society wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop
into social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned
about other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly
and ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct
their lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being
noticed by other people, then those people have fewer data
points on which to reject you. Now, social anxiety disorder is one of the most common
mental illnesses in the world. In the United States alone, more than 12 percent of Americans
at some point in their lives will have diagnosable
social anxiety disorder. That's roughly 40 million people. Now worldwide, the estimates
are lower, they're four percent, which in and of itself is interesting. But based on current population estimates, four percent of the world
is roughly 300 million people that will potentially have
social anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. And despite how prevalent it is,
it's widely misunderstood, widely misdiagnosed and often missed entirely. This is because several myths
about social anxiety pervade our culture. The first myth is that people
with social anxiety are happier alone. The stereotype of someone
with social anxiety as a recluse who'd rather be hiding away
alone in their bedroom than out interacting with the world. And this is simply not true. In research conducted in my lab, we find that people
with social anxiety disorder desire strong, healthy,
intimate relationships to the same degree
as those without mental illness. And they do socialize, they’re not robotic aliens. And when they socialize, they often enjoy doing so. In fact, when we ask people
with social anxiety how happy they are, they report feeling happier
when they are with other people than when they're alone. This is because not all social
interactions are stressful. Maybe someone feels
socially anxious with friends but not their romantic partner. Or they feel anxious with strangers
and acquaintances but not people like their
neighbors or coworkers. So even though some
interactions are stressful, people with social anxiety are not devoid
of the basic desire for human connection. They just have trouble obtaining it
in certain situations with certain people. OK, so maybe then people
with social anxiety do socialize, and when they do, they enjoy it. But it's with a small,
tight-knit group of people. And really, social anxiety is about
avoiding the spotlight. And this is the second myth. Social anxiety is not necessarily
about a fear of public performance. While this is true of some people, other people with social anxiety
find performing in front of others less anxiety-provoking than smaller, more intimate conversations, like when they have to carry
a conversation one on one. Many people with social anxiety
excel in careers that are intertwined with social
evaluation and social performance. Modeling, acting, sports. In May of 2021, Naomi Osaka declined to participate
in press conferences of the French Open. She courageously and preemptively shared that they exacerbated her social anxiety. Shortly thereafter, she received a wave
of public backlash and scrutiny. She goes on to play her first match, of course, wins, and then she withdraws
from the French Open. Many people were perplexed about how someone
could have social anxiety and also be the number one ranked
tennis player in the world, lead a fashion campaign
with Nike -- good choice -- and don the cover of Sports
Illustrated in a swimsuit. In an interview the year prior
discussing her social anxiety, Osaka explained: "On the court is completely different. I love playing at Arthur Ashe
because it’s the biggest stadium, and you feel the rumble of the crowd. You kind of feel like a gladiator
because it’s super-big and there are so many people
watching your match. But off the court, if I was ever thrown into a situation where I had to speak
in front of 100 people, I feel like I would start shaking." There is no one-size-fits-all
profile of social anxiety. Just like people who are depressed
have different collections of symptoms at different times for different reasons, social anxiety looks different
in different people. And last and maybe
the most problematic myth. That social anxiety
is fleeting and harmless. Social anxiety is not just
something you grow out of. It doesn't magically disappear when you graduate
middle school or high school. Without intervention, many people struggle
with social anxiety for years, for decades. And social anxiety can influence
every aspect of a person's life. It can influence the hobbies they choose, maybe opting for solo activities
like reading, writing, rather than things like team sports. It can influence
the careers people pursue. Maybe opting for careers
with more individual, like computer time, versus things like sales
or customer service. And social anxiety could influence
people's everyday lives. Ricky Williams, star NFL running back, Heisman-winning running back, dazzled millions of people
on the football field every week. And yet he shared that he struggled
with social anxiety, and because of it, he had difficulty interacting
with teammates, running everyday errands where he'd have to interact with people and even interacting
with his own daughter. The real tragedy of social anxiety is that it robs individuals
of their greatest resource: other people. Other people help us overcome adversity, like recovering from illness
or after you bomb a job interview. Other people help us celebrate milestones like showing up to the birth of our child
or a wedding or a graduation. And other people help us overcome loss, like grieving the death of a loved one. Our fear of rejection gets in the way
of obtaining and appreciating the benefits of being accepted,
the benefits of other people. And in our modern world, it is harder than ever
to manage social anxiety. We are more connected today
than any time in human history, and yet we are lonelier, more depressed and more socially anxious than ever. We have endless tools to socialize, and yet we're seeing
a decaying social connection. In a rapid amount of time, our social structures have been
upended and rewritten. Technology and social media
have created new standards for social relationships and interactions: "Do I post it, do I share it,
do I like it, do I love it?" We create these bizarre
extensions of ourselves through curated profiles and now avatars. We try to make sense of unlimited feedback from a massive and often
invisible audience. And the costs of social
blunders are higher. Things you do and things you say
can live online forever and subject you to unforgiving scrutiny, reputation loss and even job loss. It is a tough time to have social anxiety. But the world will become more,
not less, connected, and the influence of technology
and social media will grow, not shrink. Now is the time to address social anxiety. And here's how. The first and maybe easiest thing
we can do is identify early. Early detection is critical because of those who go on
to develop social anxiety disorder, more than half will have developed it
before their 14th birthday. More than half. And social anxiety puts people at risk for developing other
mental illnesses later on. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression, social anxiety came first
70 percent of the time. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, social anxiety came first. It was developed first approximately
80 percent of the time. What these data suggests
is that social anxiety starts early, and it puts people at risk
for developing other mental illnesses. But here's the incredible part. Social anxiety can be reliably
and accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions. Questions like: "Is your fear of rejection
among one of your worst fears?" And "Does your fear of rejection
get in the way of doing things that you'd otherwise
want to be or enjoy doing?" The cost of asking these questions
is like 30 seconds and zero dollars. We don't have to create
new infrastructures. We don't have to upend existing ones. We can embed early detection programs
into our existing structures like at schools, new year orientation, one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings. Because if a doctor
can screen for depression, then she can also screen
for social anxiety. Early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter
the trajectories of young people. The second thing we can do
is harness our platforms. One of the benefits of living
in this hyperconnected world is that a single person
can have a ton of power. They can use their platforms to create
meaningful and lasting social change. I mentioned Ricky Williams and Osaka, who have used their platforms to share
about their social anxiety. And just from these two people,
we’ve seen a ripple effect. In response to Osaka's announcement, Viola Davis, Oscar, Emmy, Tony-award winning actress, shared that she struggles
with social anxiety. A woman whose job it is as an actress to embody and express
the complexities of people in very vulnerable and very public ways. But frankly, these celebrities are not
the poster children for social anxiety. They're just three
of the millions who suffer, who were brave enough to talk about it. And we can do the same with our platforms,
however big or small. In our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities and in our homes. Because regular, candid and forthcoming
conversations about mental illness ultimately reduce stigma, correct harmful myths and get people the help that they need. The last thing that we can do
is foster social courage. Addressing social anxiety is not
about preventing or avoiding rejection. Addressing social anxiety
is about fostering social courage. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences and knowing that your chances
of rejection are not zero. In fact, the chances that you get rejected
at some point in your life, at some point this year, are high. And worse, you may be rejected
as a function of who you are. Things about yourself
that you cannot change. Where you come from, what you look like or who you love. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences because they are important to you and knowing that the successes
of those pursuits are not contingent
on your worth as a human being. Being socially courageous
means knowing your worth and finding people and social groups that love and accept that person. And being socially courageous
means asking that person out, applying for that job, speaking up at that meeting or that party or giving that big talk on that big stage, knowing that rejection lurks
around the corner. But the opportunity for growth
and for purpose shines brighter. A purpose not defined by ensuring
that you go unnoticed in this world, but a purpose that makes you feel
most alive, most present and most authentically you. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Friendships can hold an exceptional
place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step.

**Transcript**:
Friendships can hold an exceptional
place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step.

**Transcript**:
The body becomes its own corset. Past, present, and future 
exist as a single force. A swing without gravity soars 
to a terrifying height. The outlines of people and things 
dissolve. Countless poets and writers 
have tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack— a sensation so overwhelming, many people 
mistake it for a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don’t cause 
long-term physical harm, afterwards, the fear of another attack 
can limit someone’s daily life— and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one 
panic attack in our lives. And whether it’s your first, 
your hundredth, or you’re witnessing someone else 
go through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can 
be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary— because the first step to preventing 
panic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack 
is an overreaction to the body’s normal physiological response 
to the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved 
in processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates 
the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase 
in the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen 
to the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, 
making it more alert and responsive. During a panic attack, this response is exaggerated 
well past what would be useful in a dangerous situation, causing a racing heart, heavy breathing, 
or hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow 
cause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks 
within 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex 
takes over from the amygdala and stimulates 
the parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone 
called acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate 
and gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body’s 
perception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would
have to a real threat— and then some. We don't know for sure 
why this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment 
that remind us of traumatic past experience 
can trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part 
of anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, 
and generalized anxiety disorder. Recurring panic attacks, 
frequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes 
to avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis 
of a panic disorder. The two main treatments 
for panic disorder are antidepressant medication 
and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate— though someone who responds to one 
may not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications 
carry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse 
when they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, 
with only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic 
disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools 
to exert physical, and in turn mental, control over the sensations and thoughts 
associated with a panic attack. CBT begins with an explanation of the 
physiological causes of a panic attack, followed by breath and muscle exercises 
designed to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying 
and changing the thoughts that are common during attacks— such as believing you’ll stop breathing, 
have a heart attack, or die— and replacing them 
with more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure 
to the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief, 
through experience, that these sensations and situations 
are dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps 
isn’t easy in the grip of an attack. But with practice, these tools 
can both prevent and de-escalate attacks, and ultimately reduce the hold of panic 
on a person’s life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same 
beliefs CBT aims to instill: that fear can’t hurt you, 
but holding on to it will escalate panic. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify 
one in yourself or someone else— and recognizing them is the first step 
in preventing them.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the characteristics of panic disorder, specifically the fear of getting another panic attack and avoiding situations that may trigger an attack.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is about common thought patterns during a panic attack, which is related to the cognitive aspects of panic disorder. However, it does not directly address the characteristics of panic disorder mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that addresses the diagnostic criteria or characteristics of panic disorder. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, which is about the primary goal of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating panic disorder. While it does not directly address the characteristics of panic disorder, it is related to the treatment of panic disorder, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the characteristics of panic disorder mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (with a weak match)

be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary— because the first step to preventing 
panic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack 
is an overreaction to the body’s normal physiological response 
to the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved 
in processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates 
the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase 
in the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen 
to the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, 
making it more alert and responsive. During a panic attack, this response is exaggerated 
well past what would be useful in a dangerous situation, causing a racing heart, heavy breathing, 
or hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow 
cause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks 
within 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex 
takes over from the amygdala and stimulates 
the parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone 
called acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate 
and gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body’s 
perception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would
have to a real threat— and then some. We don't know for sure 
why this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment 
that remind us of traumatic past experience 
can trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part 
of anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, 
and generalized anxiety disorder. Recurring panic attacks, 
frequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes 
to avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis 
of a panic disorder. The two main treatments 
for panic disorder are antidepressant medication 
and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate— though someone who responds to one 
may not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications 
carry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse 
when they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, 
with only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic 
disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools 
to exert physical, and in turn mental, control over the sensations and thoughts 
associated with a panic attack. CBT begins with an explanation of the 
physiological causes of a panic attack, followed by breath and muscle exercises 
designed to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying 
and changing the thoughts that are common during attacks— such as believing you’ll stop breathing, 
have a heart attack, or die— and replacing them 
with more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure 
to the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief, 
through experience, that these sensations and situations 
are dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps 
isn’t easy in the grip of an attack. But with practice, these tools 
can both prevent and de-escalate attacks, and ultimately reduce the hold of panic 
on a person’s life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same 
beliefs CBT aims to instill: that fear can’t hurt you, 
but holding on to it will escalate panic. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify 
one in yourself or someone else— and recognizing them is the first step 
in preventing them.

**Transcript**:
The body becomes its own corset. Past, present, and future 
exist as a single force. A swing without gravity soars 
to a terrifying height. The outlines of people and things 
dissolve. Countless poets and writers 
have tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack— a sensation so overwhelming, many people 
mistake it for a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don’t cause 
long-term physical harm, afterwards, the fear of another attack 
can limit someone’s daily life— and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one 
panic attack in our lives. And whether it’s your first, 
your hundredth, or you’re witnessing someone else 
go through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can

**Transcript**:
In March of 1892, three Black grocery store owners 
in Memphis, Tennessee, were murdered by a mob of white men. Lynchings like these were happening 
all over the American South, often without any subsequent legal 
investigation or consequences for the murderers. But this time, a young journalist and 
friend of the victims set out to expose the truth 
about these killings. Her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an 
investigative journalist, civic leader, and civil rights advocate. Her name was Ida B. Wells. Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery 
in Holly Springs, Mississippi on July 16, 1862, several months before
the Emancipation Proclamation released her and her family. After losing both parents and a brother 
to yellow fever at the age of 16, she supported her five remaining siblings by working as a schoolteacher 
in Memphis, Tennessee. During this time, she began working as a journalist. Writing under the pen name “Iola,” by the early 1890s she gained 
a reputation as a clear voice against racial injustice and become co-owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech 
and Headlight newspaper. She had no shortage of material: in the decades following the Civil War, Southern whites attempted to reassert 
their power by committing crimes against Black people including suppressing their votes, vandalizing their businesses, 
and even murdering them. After the murder of her friends, Wells launched an investigation 
into lynching. She analyzed specific cases through 
newspaper reports and police records, and interviewed people who had lost 
friends and family to lynch mobs. She risked her life 
to get this information. As a Black person investigating racially 
motivated murders, she enraged many of the same southern 
white men involved in lynchings. Her bravery paid off. Most whites had claimed and 
subsequently reported that lynchings were responses to criminal
acts by Black people. But that was not usually the case. Through her research, Wells showed that these murders 
were actually a deliberate, brutal tactic to control or punish 
black people who competed with whites. Her friends, for example, had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business 
from a white competitor. Wells published her findings in 1892. In response, a white mob destroyed 
her newspaper presses. She was out of town when they struck, but they threatened to kill her 
if she ever returned to Memphis. So she traveled to New York, where that same year she re-published 
her research in a pamphlet titled Southern Horrors: Lynch Law 
in All Its Phases. In 1895, after settling in Chicago, she built on Southern Horrors in a longer 
piece called The Red Record. Her careful documentation of the horrors 
of lynching and impassioned public speeches 
drew international attention. Wells used her newfound fame 
to amplify her message. She traveled to Europe, where she rallied European outrage against
racial violence in the American South in hopes that the US government and public
would follow their example. Back in the US, she didn’t hesitate to confront powerful 
organizations, fighting the segregationist 
policies of the YMCA and leading a delegation 
to the White House to protest discriminatory 
workplace practices. She did all this while 
disenfranchised herself. Women didn’t win the right to vote 
until Wells was in her late 50s. And even then, the vote was primarily 
extended to white women only. Wells was a key player in the battle 
for voting inclusion, starting a Black women’s 
suffrage organization in Chicago. But in spite of her deep commitment 
to women’s rights, she clashed with white leaders 
of the movement. During a march for women’s 
suffrage in Washington D.C., she ignored the organizers’ attempt 
to placate Southern bigotry by placing Black women in the back, and marched up front alongside
the white women. She also chafed with other 
civil rights leaders, who saw her as a dangerous radical. She insisted on airing, in full detail, 
the atrocities taking place in the South, while others thought doing so would be 
counterproductive to negotiations with white politicians. Although she participated in the founding 
of the NAACP, she was soon sidelined 
from the organization. Wells’ unwillingness to compromise any 
aspect of her vision of justice shined a light on the weak points 
of the various rights movements, and ultimately made them stronger— but also made it difficult for her 
to find a place within them. She was ahead of her time, waging a tireless struggle 
for equality and justice decades before many had even begun 
to imagine it possible.

all over the American South, often without any subsequent legal 
investigation or consequences for the murderers. But this time, a young journalist and 
friend of the victims set out to expose the truth 
about these killings. Her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an 
investigative journalist, civic leader, and civil rights advocate. Her name was Ida B. Wells. Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery 
in Holly Springs, Mississippi on July 16, 1862, several months before
the Emancipation Proclamation released her and her family. After losing both parents and a brother 
to yellow fever at the age of 16, she supported her five remaining siblings by working as a schoolteacher 
in Memphis, Tennessee. During this time, she began working as a journalist. Writing under the pen name “Iola,” by the early 1890s she gained 
a reputation as a clear voice against racial injustice and become co-owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech 
and Headlight newspaper. She had no shortage of material: in the decades following the Civil War, Southern whites attempted to reassert 
their power by committing crimes against Black people including suppressing their votes, vandalizing their businesses, 
and even murdering them. After the murder of her friends, Wells launched an investigation 
into lynching. She analyzed specific cases through 
newspaper reports and police records, and interviewed people who had lost 
friends and family to lynch mobs. She risked her life 
to get this information. As a Black person investigating racially 
motivated murders, she enraged many of the same southern 
white men involved in lynchings. Her bravery paid off. Most whites had claimed and 
subsequently reported that lynchings were responses to criminal
acts by Black people. But that was not usually the case. Through her research, Wells showed that these murders 
were actually a deliberate, brutal tactic to control or punish 
black people who competed with whites. Her friends, for example, had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business 
from a white competitor. Wells published her findings in 1892. In response, a white mob destroyed 
her newspaper presses. She was out of town when they struck, but they threatened to kill her 
if she ever returned to Memphis. So she traveled to New York, where that same year she re-published 
her research in a pamphlet titled Southern Horrors: Lynch Law 
in All Its Phases. In 1895, after settling in Chicago, she built on Southern Horrors in a longer 
piece called The Red Record. Her careful documentation of the horrors 
of lynching and impassioned public speeches 
drew international attention. Wells used her newfound fame 
to amplify her message. She traveled to Europe, where she rallied European outrage against
racial violence in the American South in hopes that the US government and public
would follow their example. Back in the US, she didn’t hesitate to confront powerful 
organizations, fighting the segregationist 
policies of the YMCA and leading a delegation 
to the White House to protest discriminatory 
workplace practices. She did all this while 
disenfranchised herself. Women didn’t win the right to vote 
until Wells was in her late 50s. And even then, the vote was primarily 
extended to white women only. Wells was a key player in the battle 
for voting inclusion, starting a Black women’s 
suffrage organization in Chicago. But in spite of her deep commitment 
to women’s rights, she clashed with white leaders 
of the movement. During a march for women’s 
suffrage in Washington D.C., she ignored the organizers’ attempt 
to placate Southern bigotry by placing Black women in the back, and marched up front alongside
the white women. She also chafed with other 
civil rights leaders, who saw her as a dangerous radical. She insisted on airing, in full detail, 
the atrocities taking place in the South, while others thought doing so would be 
counterproductive to negotiations with white politicians. Although she participated in the founding 
of the NAACP, she was soon sidelined 
from the organization. Wells’ unwillingness to compromise any 
aspect of her vision of justice shined a light on the weak points 
of the various rights movements, and ultimately made them stronger— but also made it difficult for her 
to find a place within them. She was ahead of her time, waging a tireless struggle 
for equality and justice decades before many had even begun 
to imagine it possible.

**Transcript**:
On December 12, 1904, 
Chief Lontulu laid 110 twigs in front of a foreign commission. Every twig represented a person 
in his village who died because of King Leopold’s horrific regime
in the Congo— all in the name of rubber. Chief Lontulu separated the twigs 
into four piles: tribal nobles, men, women, and children— then proceeded
to name the dead of one-by-one. His testimony joined hundreds of others
to help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities 
in history. Beginning in the late 1800s, European countries participated in the
so-called “Scramble for Africa.” They colonized 90% of the continent, exploiting African resources 
and enriching their countries. Belgium had recently become
an independent kingdom. Its ruler, Leopold II, 
wanted to acquire what he called “a slice of this magnificent 
African cake.” Meanwhile, he read colonial explorer 
Henry Morton Stanley’s reports about traveling through Africa. Stanley emphasized 
the Congo basin’s majesty. So, in 1879, Leopold contracted him
to return to the Congo. There, Stanley deceived leaders 
into signing some 450 treaties allowing for land use. Leopold persuaded the US and European
powers to grant him ownership of the Congo, pledging to protect free trade 
in the region. And on May 29, 1885, a territory more than
80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people was declared
his own private colony— by no one it actually belonged to. Leopold lost no time consolidating power 
in what he called the Congo Free State. He claimed land, raised an army, and forced many Congolese men
to complete unpaid labor. Things got even worse when, in 1887, a Scottish inventor redeveloped
the pneumatic tire, creating a massive international
market for rubber. The Congo had one of the world’s
largest supplies. Leopold seized the opportunity, requiring villages to meet 
ever-greater rubber quotas. Congolese men had to harvest
the material from wild vines. As supplies drained, they walked for days
to gather enough. Leopold’s army entered villages and held 
women and children hostage until the impossible quota was met. Soldiers sexually violated women 
and deprived children of food and water. Congolese people rebelled— they refused to cooperate, 
fought Leopold’s soldiers, hid in the forests, 
and destroyed rubber vines. Leopold’s army responded to resistance 
or failure to meet quotas with unflinching torture and executions. Because guns and ammunition
were expensive, officers ordered soldiers to prove they 
used their bullets in the line of duty by removing a hand from anyone 
they killed. However, many soldiers hunted 
using their guns. To avoid harsh penalties and account 
for lost bullets, they cut off living people’s hands. They also used this practice
as punishment. If rubber quotas weren’t met, soldiers would sever people’s hands
and bring them to their commanders instead of rubber. The regime dramatically upended
daily life and agriculture, causing widespread starvation and disease. Meanwhile, King Leopold built monuments 
and private estates with the wealth he extracted. Soon, people brought international
attention to the horrific abuses of Leopold’s Congo Free State. In 1890, American journalist 
George Washington Williams accused King Leopold of “deceit, fraud, 
robberies, arson, murder, slave-raiding,
and [a] general policy of cruelty.” In 1903, Diplomat Roger Casement 
wrote a report that corroborated the nature and scale of the atrocities. It was published the following year. In response, Leopold appointed his own 
commission to investigate the accusations. They heard numerous witness statements 
in the Congo— Chief Lontulu’s included. The report only confirmed the worst. Facing pressure, Leopold relinquished 
control of the Congo to the Belgian government in 1908. But this did not mean justice. The Belgian state awarded Leopold
50 million francs “in testimony for his great sacrifice 
in favor of the Congo.” He died the following year. Crowds booed his funeral procession. For more than 50 years following,
the Congo remained a Belgian colony, until declaring independence in 1960. That year, the Congo elected its first
prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. But months later, he was unseated 
in a US and Belgium backed coup. In early 1961, Lumumba was assassinated 
under Belgian supervision. The coup launched the country 
into a decades-long dictatorship. Around 10 million Congolese people 
are thought to have died during Leopold’s occupation and looting 
of the Congo. Despite this devastation, calls 
for reparations have gone unanswered. To this day, throughout Belgium can be 
found the monuments King Leopold built on a foundation of inconceivable cruelty.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of the Congo declaring independence, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it still does not match the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 asks about King Leopold's control over the Congo in 1908, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the year the Congo declared independence.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ. A new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the year of the Congo's independence would be a better match.

However, if I had to provide an index, I would say: Question 8 (with the caveat that it's not a good match).

**Transcript**:
On December 12, 1904, 
Chief Lontulu laid 110 twigs in front of a foreign commission. Every twig represented a person 
in his village who died because of King Leopold’s horrific regime
in the Congo— all in the name of rubber. Chief Lontulu separated the twigs 
into four piles: tribal nobles, men, women, and children— then proceeded
to name the dead of one-by-one. His testimony joined hundreds of others
to help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities 
in history. Beginning in the late 1800s, European countries participated in the
so-called “Scramble for Africa.” They colonized 90% of the continent, exploiting African resources 
and enriching their countries. Belgium had recently become
an independent kingdom. Its ruler, Leopold II, 
wanted to acquire what he called “a slice of this magnificent 
African cake.” Meanwhile, he read colonial explorer 
Henry Morton Stanley’s reports about traveling through Africa. Stanley emphasized 
the Congo basin’s majesty. So, in 1879, Leopold contracted him
to return to the Congo. There, Stanley deceived leaders 
into signing some 450 treaties allowing for land use. Leopold persuaded the US and European
powers to grant him ownership of the Congo, pledging to protect free trade 
in the region. And on May 29, 1885, a territory more than
80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people was declared
his own private colony— by no one it actually belonged to. Leopold lost no time consolidating power 
in what he called the Congo Free State. He claimed land, raised an army, and forced many Congolese men
to complete unpaid labor. Things got even worse when, in 1887, a Scottish inventor redeveloped
the pneumatic tire, creating a massive international
market for rubber. The Congo had one of the world’s
largest supplies. Leopold seized the opportunity, requiring villages to meet 
ever-greater rubber quotas. Congolese men had to harvest
the material from wild vines. As supplies drained, they walked for days
to gather enough. Leopold’s army entered villages and held 
women and children hostage until the impossible quota was met. Soldiers sexually violated women 
and deprived children of food and water. Congolese people rebelled— they refused to cooperate, 
fought Leopold’s soldiers, hid in the forests, 
and destroyed rubber vines. Leopold’s army responded to resistance 
or failure to meet quotas with unflinching torture and executions. Because guns and ammunition
were expensive, officers ordered soldiers to prove they 
used their bullets in the line of duty by removing a hand from anyone 
they killed. However, many soldiers hunted 
using their guns. To avoid harsh penalties and account 
for lost bullets, they cut off living people’s hands. They also used this practice
as punishment. If rubber quotas weren’t met, soldiers would sever people’s hands
and bring them to their commanders instead of rubber. The regime dramatically upended
daily life and agriculture, causing widespread starvation and disease. Meanwhile, King Leopold built monuments 
and private estates with the wealth he extracted. Soon, people brought international
attention to the horrific abuses of Leopold’s Congo Free State. In 1890, American journalist 
George Washington Williams accused King Leopold of “deceit, fraud, 
robberies, arson, murder, slave-raiding,
and [a] general policy of cruelty.” In 1903, Diplomat Roger Casement 
wrote a report that corroborated the nature and scale of the atrocities. It was published the following year. In response, Leopold appointed his own 
commission to investigate the accusations. They heard numerous witness statements 
in the Congo— Chief Lontulu’s included. The report only confirmed the worst. Facing pressure, Leopold relinquished 
control of the Congo to the Belgian government in 1908. But this did not mean justice. The Belgian state awarded Leopold
50 million francs “in testimony for his great sacrifice 
in favor of the Congo.” He died the following year. Crowds booed his funeral procession. For more than 50 years following,
the Congo remained a Belgian colony, until declaring independence in 1960. That year, the Congo elected its first
prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. But months later, he was unseated 
in a US and Belgium backed coup. In early 1961, Lumumba was assassinated 
under Belgian supervision. The coup launched the country 
into a decades-long dictatorship. Around 10 million Congolese people 
are thought to have died during Leopold’s occupation and looting 
of the Congo. Despite this devastation, calls 
for reparations have gone unanswered. To this day, throughout Belgium can be 
found the monuments King Leopold built on a foundation of inconceivable cruelty.

**Transcript**:
In early 1828, Sojourner Truth approached
the Grand Jury of Kingston, New York. She had no experience 
with the legal system, no money, and no power 
in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for
custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold 
to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out 
over the next several months, Truth raised funds, 
strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, 
Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate 
the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding. Truth was born into slavery 
as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century
in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced 
the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of 
indentured servitude until their mid-20s. Throughout this period, 
enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented 
from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man 
named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep 
her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition 
threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, 
had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, 
Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able 
to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children 
remained in bondage. It would be two years before 
she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait 
another two years before she saw any of her other children. During this time, 
Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated 
to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community 
that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking 
aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers
took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice 
of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known 
as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on 
Biblical references, spiritual ideals, 
and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression 
of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns 
for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself 
Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary 
speaking tour. Truth saw her journey 
as a mission from God. Her faith often led her 
to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences 
as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded 
to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set 
fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling 
herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out 
and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, 
my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer,
until they had no desire to harm her. Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of
people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond
public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved
with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing 
supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that 
she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue 
that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government. Truth continued to travel 
and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883, 
she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard 
in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even
in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful 
and will prevail."

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, to identify the most similar generated MCQ, I will look for questions that share similar characteristics, such as asking about Sojourner Truth's personal life or background.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Sojourner Truth's name at birth. Among the generated MCQs, none ask about her birth name directly. However, some questions do ask about her life events or experiences.

Considering the options, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar in terms of intent, as it asks about a specific event in Sojourner Truth's life (embarking on a speaking tour) and provides options with specific years. However, this is still not a direct match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. However, if I had to pick one, I would say Question 6 is the most similar in terms of intent and format.

and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, 
my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer,
until they had no desire to harm her. Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of
people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond
public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved
with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing 
supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that 
she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue 
that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government. Truth continued to travel 
and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883, 
she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard 
in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even
in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful 
and will prevail."

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to Sojourner Truth's personal life.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of children Sojourner Truth had. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions her experience with her children, but it does not ask about the number of children she had.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar enough to be considered a match. However, if I had to choose one based on relevance to Sojourner Truth's personal life, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: None (or 3, if we consider relevance to personal life, but with a note that it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
In early 1828, Sojourner Truth approached
the Grand Jury of Kingston, New York. She had no experience 
with the legal system, no money, and no power 
in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for
custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold 
to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out 
over the next several months, Truth raised funds, 
strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, 
Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate 
the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding. Truth was born into slavery 
as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century
in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced 
the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of 
indentured servitude until their mid-20s. Throughout this period, 
enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented 
from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man 
named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep 
her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition 
threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, 
had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, 
Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able 
to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children 
remained in bondage. It would be two years before 
she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait 
another two years before she saw any of her other children. During this time, 
Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated 
to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community 
that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking 
aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers
took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice 
of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known 
as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on 
Biblical references, spiritual ideals, 
and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression 
of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns 
for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself 
Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary 
speaking tour. Truth saw her journey 
as a mission from God. Her faith often led her 
to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences 
as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded 
to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set 
fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling 
herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out 
and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, 
my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer,

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the moral Arc of the universe is long but it bends toward Justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a visions of humanity compassion and justce Justice and more than anything for those of you who share that I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on thank you very much Brian um so you heard and saw an obvious Desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue other than writing a check what what could we do well there are opportunities all around us if you live in the state of California for example there is a referendum coming up this uh spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment for example here in California we spend we're going to spend $1 billion on the death penalty in the next 5 years $1 billion uh and yet 46% of all homicide cases don't result in arrests uh 56% of all rape cases don't result so there's an opportunity to change that and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to uh law enforcement and and and safety and I think that opportunity exists all around us now there's been this huge decline in crime in in America over the last three decades and part of The Narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that well actually the violent crime rate has has remained relatively stable you know the the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided War on Drugs that's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population a and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low-level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back back to the people who they victimized I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one and I think that's the orientation that we have to change Brian you've you've struck a massive cord here you're an inspiring person thank you so much for coming to T thank you [Music] than

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not

be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the moral Arc of the universe is long but it bends toward Justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a visions of humanity compassion and justce Justice and more than anything for those of you who share that I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on thank you very much Brian um so you heard and saw an obvious Desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue other than writing a check what what could we do well there are opportunities all around us if you live in the state of California for example there is a referendum coming up this uh spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment for example here in California we spend we're going to spend $1 billion on the death penalty in the next 5 years $1 billion uh and yet 46% of all homicide cases don't result in arrests uh 56% of all rape cases don't result so there's an opportunity to change that and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to uh law enforcement and and and safety and I think that opportunity exists all around us now there's been this huge decline in crime in in America over the last three decades and part of The Narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that well actually the violent crime rate has has remained relatively stable you know the the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided War on Drugs that's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population a and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low-level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back back to the people who they victimized I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one and I think that's the orientation that we have to change Brian you've you've struck a massive cord here you're an inspiring person thank you so much for coming to T thank you [Music] than

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the moral Arc of the universe is long but it bends toward Justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a visions of humanity compassion and justce Justice and more than anything for

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of people in jails and prisons in the United States in 2012, compared to 1972. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions the current state of the US prison system, which is related to the topic.

However, I must note that Question 3 does not specifically ask about the number of people in jails and prisons, and its options do not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, but with the caveat that it is not a very close match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and it would be best to create a new MCQ that specifically asks about the number of people in jails and prisons in the United States in 2012, compared to 1972.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the moral Arc of the universe is long but it bends toward Justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a visions of humanity compassion and justce Justice and more than anything for those of you who share that I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on thank you very much Brian um so you heard and saw an obvious Desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue other than writing a check what what could we do well there are opportunities all around us if you live in the state of California for example there is a referendum coming up this uh spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment for example here in California we spend we're going to spend $1 billion on the death penalty in the next 5 years $1 billion uh and yet 46% of all homicide cases don't result in arrests uh 56% of all rape cases don't result so there's an opportunity to change that and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to uh law enforcement and and and safety and I think that opportunity exists all around us now there's been this huge decline in crime in in America over the last three decades and part of The Narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that well actually the violent crime rate has has remained relatively stable you know the the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided War on Drugs that's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population a and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low-level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back back to the people who they victimized I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one and I think that's the orientation that we have to change Brian you've you've struck a massive cord here you're an inspiring person thank you so much for coming to T thank you [Music] than

**Transcript**:
As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica, children flock to Mr. Kwaku for a story. They all know he’s full of tales 
from Ghana, the land of their ancestors. But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks, is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place. Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,
the all-seeing Sky God. People on Earth were bored 
and knew nothing about their history. But one creature decided
enough was enough. Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider, resolved to bring the stories
down to Earth. He spun a web that stretched 
into the clouds and climbed up to confront the Sky God. Crouching at Nyame’s feet,
Anansi shouted at the top of his lungs that he had come to take ownership 
of the world’s stories. Looking down from his golden stool, Nyame hooted with laughter 
at the spider’s absurd request. Nyame told Anansi that he could have
all the stories he wished— but only if he could complete
an impossible task. If Anansi brought him 
Osebo the Leopard, Onini the Python, Mmoboro the Hornet, 
and Mmoatia the Forest Spirit, then he could take the stories. Anansi humbly accepted. Nyame didn’t see him grinning 
as he scuttled away. Back on Earth, Anansi grabbed 
his magic bag and set to work. Anansi found Onini the Python
bathing in the sun. Anansi scoffed that Onini 
couldn’t be the longest animal, saying he looked no longer 
than a piece of bamboo cane. Enraged, Onini stretched himself across
the bamboo to prove his lengthiness. Anansi quickly bound him tight-tight 
to each end and placed him in his bag. Next, Anansi dug a great pit 
in the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,
and covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,
but offered to rescue him. As he helped Osebo out of the pit,
Anansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife. Osebo fell back to the ground where Anansi wound him up
tight-tight in spider thread. Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro 
and his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings 
could make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water 
and spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets
to shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:
to capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,
but Anansi knew she was lonely. So, he made a little doll covered in sap
and left it in her path. When she came upon it, 
Mmoatia spoke to the doll but became enraged when it didn’t answer. She hit the disrespectful doll and her small fists stuck 
to its sticky surface. Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tight-tight 
and scooped her into his bag along with the other creatures. Triumphantly, he climbed his web
back into the clouds. When the Sky God saw that Anansi 
had completed the impossible task, he was amazed. Nyame told Anansi 
that he had earned the world’s stories. Dancing for joy, Anansi gathered them up,
stuffed the stories into his bag, and descended to Earth. There, he scattered the stories 
throughout the world for people to share. And they did, Kwaku tells the children. Generations have continued
telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa
and enslaved. Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s
better than strong,” Kwaku says, and tells the children to take Anansi’s 
stories with them wherever they go. Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows
that Anansi will persist as a symbol of resourcefulness 
and resistance in the face of oppression, and a testament to the enduring power
of storytelling.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the origin of the Anansi stories. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 1 mentions the main character in the story that Mr. Kwaku tells the children, which is Anansi, and it is mentioned in the transcript that Anansi's stories are from Ghana (West Africa).

However, a more relevant question is not available. But if I had to choose one that could be indirectly related, I would choose Question 1, since it talks about Anansi, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

But since it is stated that "Generations have continued telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa and enslaved." in the transcript, Question 9 could be another option since it talks about how the stories have been passed down, which could be related to their origin.

However, please note that neither Question 1 nor Question 9 directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but with a very low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica, children flock to Mr. Kwaku for a story. They all know he’s full of tales 
from Ghana, the land of their ancestors. But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks, is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place. Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,
the all-seeing Sky God. People on Earth were bored 
and knew nothing about their history. But one creature decided
enough was enough. Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider, resolved to bring the stories
down to Earth. He spun a web that stretched 
into the clouds and climbed up to confront the Sky God. Crouching at Nyame’s feet,
Anansi shouted at the top of his lungs that he had come to take ownership 
of the world’s stories. Looking down from his golden stool, Nyame hooted with laughter 
at the spider’s absurd request. Nyame told Anansi that he could have
all the stories he wished— but only if he could complete
an impossible task. If Anansi brought him 
Osebo the Leopard, Onini the Python, Mmoboro the Hornet, 
and Mmoatia the Forest Spirit, then he could take the stories. Anansi humbly accepted. Nyame didn’t see him grinning 
as he scuttled away. Back on Earth, Anansi grabbed 
his magic bag and set to work. Anansi found Onini the Python
bathing in the sun. Anansi scoffed that Onini 
couldn’t be the longest animal, saying he looked no longer 
than a piece of bamboo cane. Enraged, Onini stretched himself across
the bamboo to prove his lengthiness. Anansi quickly bound him tight-tight 
to each end and placed him in his bag. Next, Anansi dug a great pit 
in the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,
and covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,
but offered to rescue him. As he helped Osebo out of the pit,
Anansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife. Osebo fell back to the ground where Anansi wound him up
tight-tight in spider thread. Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro 
and his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings 
could make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water 
and spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets
to shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:
to capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the story's context.

The ground truth MCQ asks about how Anansi's stories ended up being told in the Caribbean. The closest generated MCQ that relates to the story's context is Question 9: "How have Anansi's stories been passed down through generations?"

Although Question 9 does not directly ask about the Caribbean, it does mention the passing down of Anansi's stories through generations, which is related to the story's context of how the stories were shared and spread.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

and his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings 
could make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water 
and spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets
to shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:
to capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,
but Anansi knew she was lonely. So, he made a little doll covered in sap
and left it in her path. When she came upon it, 
Mmoatia spoke to the doll but became enraged when it didn’t answer. She hit the disrespectful doll and her small fists stuck 
to its sticky surface. Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tight-tight 
and scooped her into his bag along with the other creatures. Triumphantly, he climbed his web
back into the clouds. When the Sky God saw that Anansi 
had completed the impossible task, he was amazed. Nyame told Anansi 
that he had earned the world’s stories. Dancing for joy, Anansi gathered them up,
stuffed the stories into his bag, and descended to Earth. There, he scattered the stories 
throughout the world for people to share. And they did, Kwaku tells the children. Generations have continued
telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa
and enslaved. Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s
better than strong,” Kwaku says, and tells the children to take Anansi’s 
stories with them wherever they go. Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows
that Anansi will persist as a symbol of resourcefulness 
and resistance in the face of oppression, and a testament to the enduring power
of storytelling.

Translator: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years. Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy. The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready? Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind, that is "to follow." As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. Three trees together, we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire? Two fires together, I get really hot. Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning. For us, the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together, prosperous. Three together, that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door, it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home? This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. On the left, we have a woman. Two women together, they have an argument. (Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. So we have gone through almost 30 characters. By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old. So after we know the characters, we start building phrases. For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun, origin together, we build Japan. A person behind Japan, what do we get? A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Here we have an athlete
preparing for a game. They’ve put on their gear
and done their warmup, and now it’s time for one
more routine— stretching. Typically, athletes stretch before
physical activity to avoid injuries like muscle strains and tears. But does stretching actually prevent
these issues? And if so, how long do the benefits
of stretching last? To answer these questions, we need to know what's actually happening
in the body when we stretch. There are two kinds of stretching
our athlete might be doing. Dynamic stretches,
which are controlled movements that engage a range of muscles
throughout the motion. And static stretches, 
where the stretcher holds a position to keep specific muscles
at a fixed length and tension. Our athlete is currently doing
a static hamstring stretch— a 30 second interval 
where he pulls his hamstring beyond its usual range of motion. However, while we often think 
of stretching a muscle like stretching a rubber band, muscles are actually comprised
of various tissue types, which interact to make a complex material. Rubber is elastic, meaning 
it resists being stretched and then returns to its original shape. But muscle is viscoelastic. This means that, in addition
to those elastic qualities, muscle changes under the stress
of being stretched. Let’s see this in action. At the large scale, this hamstring stretch
is pulling on layers of protective tissue surrounding the muscle fibers, as well as the tendons that connect
this muscle to nearby bones. These tissues contain elastic proteins
like collagen and elastin, which allow them to slightly elongate
over the duration of the stretch. At the smaller scale, these skeletal
muscle fibers are comprised of millions of sarcomeres— the smallest contracting unit
of muscle tissue. Sarcomere’s long, fibrous proteins can
relax to elongate muscle fibers or they can contract to shorten them— pulling on tendons and protective tissue to create the force
propelling our athlete’s body. And when those tissues have
been stretched out, they retain their strength
at longer lengths, allowing our athlete to take full
advantage of his improved range of motion. Unlike a rubber band, this muscle’s
resistance to stretching decreases with each 30 second stretch, allowing our athlete
to continually elongate his hamstring. And this improved flexibility
likely decreases the chance of incurring certain muscle injuries. But due to muscle’s elastic properties, this effect will be gone in just 
10 minutes without further activity. The exercise from his match should
elevate his muscle’s temperature and continue elongating the muscle, maintaining his increased flexibility
throughout the game. But once he gives his hamstrings a break, they’ll retract back 
to their previous state. So if all this is just temporary, how can you permanently improve 
your flexibility? For skeletal muscles, improved flexibility
comes from additional sarcomeres, which allow you to maintain strength
at even greater lengths. Sarcomeres are added and subtracted
to muscles depending on how frequently they’re used, so improving overall flexibility requires
a comprehensive stretching regimen. Plus, you need to stretch often—
very often. Current research suggests at least 
10 minutes a day for roughly two months. And since it's unsafe to hold
any stretch for too long, it's recommended that you break up your
stretching within any given session. Frequent stretching also makes lasting
changes to your brain. The more you stretch a muscle,
the higher your pain threshold becomes, allowing you to stretch
further and further. Long-term improvements 
to your flexibility can provide a better range of motion for your joints, potentially reducing your risk of muscle
injury in the short and long-term. But it’s also possible
to stretch too much, as flexible people can move their joints
in potentially dangerous ways. Stretching also isn't helpful
for every kind of movement, especially those where muscle
injuries aren't very common. For example, long distance running only
involves a small range of motion for the joints involved, so stretching is unlikely to prevent
that sport’s most common injuries. When it comes down to it, different lifestyles require 
different kinds of mobility. And no single stretching regimen is
flexible enough to fit every situation.

at even greater lengths. Sarcomeres are added and subtracted
to muscles depending on how frequently they’re used, so improving overall flexibility requires
a comprehensive stretching regimen. Plus, you need to stretch often—
very often. Current research suggests at least 
10 minutes a day for roughly two months. And since it's unsafe to hold
any stretch for too long, it's recommended that you break up your
stretching within any given session. Frequent stretching also makes lasting
changes to your brain. The more you stretch a muscle,
the higher your pain threshold becomes, allowing you to stretch
further and further. Long-term improvements 
to your flexibility can provide a better range of motion for your joints, potentially reducing your risk of muscle
injury in the short and long-term. But it’s also possible
to stretch too much, as flexible people can move their joints
in potentially dangerous ways. Stretching also isn't helpful
for every kind of movement, especially those where muscle
injuries aren't very common. For example, long distance running only
involves a small range of motion for the joints involved, so stretching is unlikely to prevent
that sport’s most common injuries. When it comes down to it, different lifestyles require 
different kinds of mobility. And no single stretching regimen is
flexible enough to fit every situation.

**Transcript**:
Here we have an athlete
preparing for a game. They’ve put on their gear
and done their warmup, and now it’s time for one
more routine— stretching. Typically, athletes stretch before
physical activity to avoid injuries like muscle strains and tears. But does stretching actually prevent
these issues? And if so, how long do the benefits
of stretching last? To answer these questions, we need to know what's actually happening
in the body when we stretch. There are two kinds of stretching
our athlete might be doing. Dynamic stretches,
which are controlled movements that engage a range of muscles
throughout the motion. And static stretches, 
where the stretcher holds a position to keep specific muscles
at a fixed length and tension. Our athlete is currently doing
a static hamstring stretch— a 30 second interval 
where he pulls his hamstring beyond its usual range of motion. However, while we often think 
of stretching a muscle like stretching a rubber band, muscles are actually comprised
of various tissue types, which interact to make a complex material. Rubber is elastic, meaning 
it resists being stretched and then returns to its original shape. But muscle is viscoelastic. This means that, in addition
to those elastic qualities, muscle changes under the stress
of being stretched. Let’s see this in action. At the large scale, this hamstring stretch
is pulling on layers of protective tissue surrounding the muscle fibers, as well as the tendons that connect
this muscle to nearby bones. These tissues contain elastic proteins
like collagen and elastin, which allow them to slightly elongate
over the duration of the stretch. At the smaller scale, these skeletal
muscle fibers are comprised of millions of sarcomeres— the smallest contracting unit
of muscle tissue. Sarcomere’s long, fibrous proteins can
relax to elongate muscle fibers or they can contract to shorten them— pulling on tendons and protective tissue to create the force
propelling our athlete’s body. And when those tissues have
been stretched out, they retain their strength
at longer lengths, allowing our athlete to take full
advantage of his improved range of motion. Unlike a rubber band, this muscle’s
resistance to stretching decreases with each 30 second stretch, allowing our athlete
to continually elongate his hamstring. And this improved flexibility
likely decreases the chance of incurring certain muscle injuries. But due to muscle’s elastic properties, this effect will be gone in just 
10 minutes without further activity. The exercise from his match should
elevate his muscle’s temperature and continue elongating the muscle, maintaining his increased flexibility
throughout the game. But once he gives his hamstrings a break, they’ll retract back 
to their previous state. So if all this is just temporary, how can you permanently improve 
your flexibility? For skeletal muscles, improved flexibility
comes from additional sarcomeres, which allow you to maintain strength
at even greater lengths. Sarcomeres are added and subtracted
to muscles depending on how frequently they’re used, so improving overall flexibility requires
a comprehensive stretching regimen. Plus, you need to stretch often—
very often. Current research suggests at least

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the part of the muscle that primarily resists the stretch. The correct answer is the connective tissue surrounding the muscle.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 asks about the smallest contracting unit of muscle tissue, which is related to muscle structure but does not directly address the question of which part of the muscle resists stretching. However, it is the closest match in terms of discussing muscle components.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it is not a direct match. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that explicitly asks about the part of the muscle that resists stretching, with options that include the connective tissue surrounding the muscle.

Index: 4 (Please note that this is not a direct match, but rather the closest match based on the provided generated MCQs.)

**Transcript**:
When we watch a film or a play, we know that the actors probably learned
their lines from a script, which essentially tells them
what to say and when to say it. A piece of written music
operates on exactly the same principle. In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it. Aesthetically speaking,
there's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks
to create their music: notes. And although the end result
can sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes
is actually pretty straightforward. Let's take a look at the foundational
elements to music notation and how they interact
to create a work of art. Music is written on five parallel lines
that go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note
or what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it. Let's start with pitch. To help us out,
we're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much
any instrument you can think of. In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on. But how do these pitches get their names? Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound
pretty similar compared to, say, a B. Going back to the staff, every line and every space
between two lines represents a separate pitch. If we put a note on one of these lines
or one of these spaces, we're telling a performer
to play that pitch. The higher up on the staff
a note is placed, the higher the pitch. But there are obviously
many, many more pitches than the nine that these
lines and spaces gives us. A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. So how do we condense
88 notes onto a single staff? We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure
placed at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular
line or space corresponds to a specific note
on your instrument. If we want to play notes
that aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw
extra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them. If we have to draw so many ledger lines
that it gets confusing, then we need to change
to a different clef. As for telling a performer
when to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this. (Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily. It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really. The point is that just
like the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long
as every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time
that are all the same length: beats. With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music
really starts to happen. This is a quarter note. It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat. This is a half note,
and it's worth two beats. This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each. "Great," you say, "what does that mean?" You might have noticed
that across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it
into small sections. These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar. At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer
how many beats are in each bar. This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on. The bottom number tells
us what kind of note is to be used as the basic
unit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on. So this time signature here tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on. But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes
with different rhythms. Notice that even though
the number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats
in each bar hasn't. So, what does our musical
creation sound like? (Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe
a bit thin, right? Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm. Now it's sounding like music. Sure, it takes some practice
to get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber.

to a different clef. As for telling a performer
when to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this. (Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily. It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really. The point is that just
like the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long
as every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time
that are all the same length: beats. With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music
really starts to happen. This is a quarter note. It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat. This is a half note,
and it's worth two beats. This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each. "Great," you say, "what does that mean?" You might have noticed
that across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it
into small sections. These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar. At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer
how many beats are in each bar. This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on. The bottom number tells
us what kind of note is to be used as the basic
unit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on. So this time signature here tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on. But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes
with different rhythms. Notice that even though
the number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats
in each bar hasn't. So, what does our musical
creation sound like? (Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe
a bit thin, right? Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm. Now it's sounding like music. Sure, it takes some practice
to get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber.

**Transcript**:
When we watch a film or a play, we know that the actors probably learned
their lines from a script, which essentially tells them
what to say and when to say it. A piece of written music
operates on exactly the same principle. In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it. Aesthetically speaking,
there's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks
to create their music: notes. And although the end result
can sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes
is actually pretty straightforward. Let's take a look at the foundational
elements to music notation and how they interact
to create a work of art. Music is written on five parallel lines
that go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note
or what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it. Let's start with pitch. To help us out,
we're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much
any instrument you can think of. In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on. But how do these pitches get their names? Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound
pretty similar compared to, say, a B. Going back to the staff, every line and every space
between two lines represents a separate pitch. If we put a note on one of these lines
or one of these spaces, we're telling a performer
to play that pitch. The higher up on the staff
a note is placed, the higher the pitch. But there are obviously
many, many more pitches than the nine that these
lines and spaces gives us. A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. So how do we condense
88 notes onto a single staff? We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure
placed at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular
line or space corresponds to a specific note
on your instrument. If we want to play notes
that aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw
extra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them. If we have to draw so many ledger lines
that it gets confusing, then we need to change
to a different clef. As for telling a performer
when to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this.

**Transcript**:
Conventional wisdom about diets, including government 
health recommendations, seems to change all the time. And yet, ads routinely come about claiming to have the answer 
about what we should eat. So how do we distinguish 
what's actually healthy from what advertisers just want us
to believe is good for us? Marketing takes advantage of
the desire to drop weight fast, and be stronger, slimmer, and brighter. And in the big picture, diet plans
promising dramatic results, known as fad diets, are just what they seem:
too good to be true. So where do diet fads even come from? While the Ancient Greeks and Romans rallied behind large-scale 
health regimens centuries earlier, this phenomenon began in earnest
in the Victorian Era with crazes like the vinegar diet and the Banting Diet. Since then, diets have advised us 
all sorts of things: to excessively chew, to not chew at all, to swallow a grapefruit per meal, non-stop cabbage soup, even consumption of arsenic, or tapeworms. If the idea of diet crazes 
has withstood history, could this mean that they work? In the short term, 
the answer is often yes. Low-carbohydrate plans, like the popular Atkins 
or South Beach Diets, have an initial diuretic effect. Sodium is lost until the body
can balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,
you might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping 
your overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers 
its metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal
if the diet is abandoned. So while these diets 
may be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits
for your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,
can help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial 
in maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary
weight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting
back calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you
to only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds
in the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,
and other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient 
and remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism
for consumers. While so-called superfoods,
like blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities
are largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions 
to a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed
as part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties
outweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist 
with jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh
fruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have
either a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than
the natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions 
to how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best
left to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our 
individual circumstances. Diets and food fads 
aren't inherently wrong. Circumstantially, 
they might even be right, just not for everyone all of the time.

can balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,
you might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping 
your overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers 
its metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal
if the diet is abandoned. So while these diets 
may be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits
for your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,
can help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial 
in maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary
weight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting
back calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you
to only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds
in the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,
and other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient 
and remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism
for consumers. While so-called superfoods,
like blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities
are largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions 
to a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed
as part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties
outweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist 
with jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh
fruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have
either a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than
the natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions 
to how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best
left to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our 
individual circumstances. Diets and food fads 
aren't inherently wrong. Circumstantially, 
they might even be right, just not for everyone all of the time.

**Transcript**:
Since 2000, the annual number of people
convicted of crimes in the United States has stayed steady, but the average number
of people in jail each year has shot up. How can that be? The answer lies in the bail system— which isn’t doing 
what it was intended to do. The term "bail" refers to the release
of people awaiting trial on condition that they return 
to court to face charges. Countries around the world 
use many variations of bail, and some don’t use it at all. The U.S. bail system relies primarily 
on what’s called cash bail, which was supposed to work like this: When a person was accused of a crime, the judge would set 
a reasonable price for bail. The accused would pay this fee 
in order to be released from jail until the court reached 
a verdict on the case. Once the case ended, 
whether found guilty or innocent, they’d get the bail money back 
if they made all their court appearances. The rationale behind this system 
is that under U.S. law, people are presumed innocent
until proven guilty— so someone accused of a crime 
should not be imprisoned unless they’ve been convicted of a crime. But today, the bail system in the U.S. doesn’t honor the presumption
of innocence. Instead, it subverts peoples’ rights
and causes serious harm, particularly to people 
in low-income communities and communities of color. A key reason why is the cost of bail. In order for cash bail 
to work as intended, the price has to be affordable
for the accused. The cost of bail wasn’t meant to reflect
the likelihood of someone’s guilt— when bail is set, the court 
has not reviewed evidence. Under exceptional circumstances, 
such as charges of very serious crimes, judges could deny bail 
and jail the accused before their trial. Judges were supposed to exercise 
this power very rarely, and could come under scrutiny
for using it too often. Setting unaffordably high bail 
became a second path to denying people pretrial release. Judges' personal discretion 
and prejudices played a huge role in who they chose to detain this way. Bail amounts climbed higher and higher, 
and more and more defendants couldn’t pay— so they stayed in jail. By the late 19th century, these circumstances led to the rise 
of commercial bail bond companies. They pay a defendant’s bail, in exchange
for a hefty fee the company keeps. Today, the median bail is $10,000— a prohibitively high price 
for almost half of Americans, and as many as nine out of ten defendants. If the defendant can’t pay, they may apply for a loan 
from a commercial bail bond company. It’s completely up to the company 
to decide whose bail they’ll pay. They choose defendants they think 
will pay them back, turning a profit of about
$2 billion each year. In fact, in the past 20 years, pretrial detention has been the main
driver of jail growth in America. Every year, hundreds of thousands 
of people who can’t afford bail or secure a loan
stay in jail until their case is resolved. This injustice disproportionately affects
Americans who are Black and Latino, for whom judges often set higher bail than for white people accused
of the same offenses. Unaffordable bail puts even innocent
defendants in an impossible position. Some end up pleading guilty to crimes 
they did not commit. For minor offenses, the prosecution 
may offer a deal that credits time already spent in jail toward 
the accused’s sentence if they plead guilty. Often, the time they’ve already spent in
jail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately—
but they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely
awaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee 
an innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary
in the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished
cash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94% 
of defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned
to all their court dates. The nonprofit organization, 
The Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands
of low-income people every year, removing the financial incentive
that bail is designed to create. The result? People come back 
to 90% of their court dates without having any money on the line, and those who miss their court dates 
tended to because of circumstances like child care,
work conflicts, or medical crises. Studies have also found that holding
people in jail before trial, often because they cannot
afford cash bail, actually increases the likelihood
of rearrests and reoffending. The damage of incarcerating people 
before their trials extends to entire communities
and can harm families for generations. People who are incarcerated 
can lose their livelihoods, homes, and access to essential services— all before they’ve been convicted 
of a crime. It’s also incredibly expensive: American taxpayers spend 
nearly $14 billion every year incarcerating people 
who are legally presumed innocent. This undermines the promise 
of equal justice under the law, regardless of race or wealth. The issues surrounding cash bail 
are symptomatic of societal problems, like structural racism and over-reliance
on incarceration, that need to be addressed. In the meantime, 
reformers like The Bail Project are working to help people trapped 
by cash bail and to create a more just and humane
pretrial system for the future.

**Transcript**:
Since 2000, the annual number of people
convicted of crimes in the United States has stayed steady, but the average number
of people in jail each year has shot up. How can that be? The answer lies in the bail system— which isn’t doing 
what it was intended to do. The term "bail" refers to the release
of people awaiting trial on condition that they return 
to court to face charges. Countries around the world 
use many variations of bail, and some don’t use it at all. The U.S. bail system relies primarily 
on what’s called cash bail, which was supposed to work like this: When a person was accused of a crime, the judge would set 
a reasonable price for bail. The accused would pay this fee 
in order to be released from jail until the court reached 
a verdict on the case. Once the case ended, 
whether found guilty or innocent, they’d get the bail money back 
if they made all their court appearances. The rationale behind this system 
is that under U.S. law, people are presumed innocent
until proven guilty— so someone accused of a crime 
should not be imprisoned unless they’ve been convicted of a crime. But today, the bail system in the U.S. doesn’t honor the presumption
of innocence. Instead, it subverts peoples’ rights
and causes serious harm, particularly to people 
in low-income communities and communities of color. A key reason why is the cost of bail. In order for cash bail 
to work as intended, the price has to be affordable
for the accused. The cost of bail wasn’t meant to reflect
the likelihood of someone’s guilt— when bail is set, the court 
has not reviewed evidence. Under exceptional circumstances, 
such as charges of very serious crimes, judges could deny bail 
and jail the accused before their trial. Judges were supposed to exercise 
this power very rarely, and could come under scrutiny
for using it too often. Setting unaffordably high bail 
became a second path to denying people pretrial release. Judges' personal discretion 
and prejudices played a huge role in who they chose to detain this way. Bail amounts climbed higher and higher, 
and more and more defendants couldn’t pay— so they stayed in jail. By the late 19th century, these circumstances led to the rise 
of commercial bail bond companies. They pay a defendant’s bail, in exchange
for a hefty fee the company keeps. Today, the median bail is $10,000— a prohibitively high price 
for almost half of Americans, and as many as nine out of ten defendants. If the defendant can’t pay, they may apply for a loan 
from a commercial bail bond company. It’s completely up to the company 
to decide whose bail they’ll pay. They choose defendants they think 
will pay them back, turning a profit of about
$2 billion each year. In fact, in the past 20 years, pretrial detention has been the main
driver of jail growth in America. Every year, hundreds of thousands 
of people who can’t afford bail or secure a loan
stay in jail until their case is resolved. This injustice disproportionately affects
Americans who are Black and Latino, for whom judges often set higher bail than for white people accused
of the same offenses. Unaffordable bail puts even innocent
defendants in an impossible position. Some end up pleading guilty to crimes 
they did not commit. For minor offenses, the prosecution 
may offer a deal that credits time already spent in jail toward 
the accused’s sentence if they plead guilty. Often, the time they’ve already spent in
jail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately—
but they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely
awaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee 
an innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary
in the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished
cash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94% 
of defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned
to all their court dates. The nonprofit organization, 
The Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands
of low-income people every year, removing the financial incentive
that bail is designed to create. The result? People come back 
to 90% of their court dates without having any money on the line, and those who miss their court dates 
tended to because of circumstances like child care,
work conflicts, or medical crises. Studies have also found that holding
people in jail before trial, often because they cannot
afford cash bail, actually increases the likelihood
of rearrests and reoffending. The damage of incarcerating people 
before their trials extends to entire communities
and can harm families for generations. People who are incarcerated 
can lose their livelihoods, homes, and access to essential services— all before they’ve been convicted 
of a crime. It’s also incredibly expensive: American taxpayers spend 
nearly $14 billion every year incarcerating people 
who are legally presumed innocent. This undermines the promise 
of equal justice under the law, regardless of race or wealth. The issues surrounding cash bail 
are symptomatic of societal problems, like structural racism and over-reliance
on incarceration, that need to be addressed. In the meantime, 
reformers like The Bail Project are working to help people trapped 
by cash bail and to create a more just and humane
pretrial system for the future.

**Transcript**:
Emotional abuse can be
incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances 
of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves
one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth
and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be
subtle and difficult to spot, both from within 
and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse
often exploits or creates power imbalances 
between individuals, especially in relationships
where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between
a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,
teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because 
it often makes people doubt their perceptions 
of their own mistreatment. So let’s walk through some of the most
common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns
easier to spot in real life. First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion
to a situation, excessively harsh or personal,
or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions 
for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make
such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” 
and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; 
they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt
through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,
glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone
or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns 
of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements 
that might otherwise seem benign. Third, how someone reacts
to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful 
can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely 
and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize
the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try 
to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred 
to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,
humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss
the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you 
improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish 
and manipulative— you’re hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. Lastly, when someone directs any 
of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part 
of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling
or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have 
a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors
occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, 
whether days or years, can contribute 
to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember 
that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm 
don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle
of emotional manipulation. So what can you do if you think you
or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people
other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate 
their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing
emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences
with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national
confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know
is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen
whenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince
people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves
kindness and respect.

**Transcript**:
Emotional abuse can be
incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances 
of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves
one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth
and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be
subtle and difficult to spot, both from within 
and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse
often exploits or creates power imbalances 
between individuals, especially in relationships
where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between
a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,
teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because 
it often makes people doubt their perceptions 
of their own mistreatment. So let’s walk through some of the most
common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns
easier to spot in real life. First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion
to a situation, excessively harsh or personal,
or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions 
for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make
such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” 
and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; 
they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt
through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,
glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone
or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns 
of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements 
that might otherwise seem benign. Third, how someone reacts
to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful 
can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely 
and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize
the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try 
to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred 
to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,
humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss
the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you 
improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish 
and manipulative— you’re hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. Lastly, when someone directs any 
of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part 
of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling
or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have 
a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors
occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, 
whether days or years, can contribute 
to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember 
that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm 
don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle
of emotional manipulation. So what can you do if you think you
or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people
other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate 
their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing
emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences
with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national
confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know
is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen
whenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince
people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves
kindness and respect.

**Transcript**:
It's 4 a.m., 
and the big test is in eight hours, followed by a piano recital. You've been studying and playing for days,
but you still don't feel ready for either. So, what can you do? Well, you can drink another cup of coffee and spend the next few hours 
cramming and practicing, but believe it or not, you might be better off closing the books,
putting away the music, and going to sleep. Sleep occupies nearly 
a third of our lives, but many of us give surprisingly
little attention and care to it. This neglect is often the result 
of a major misunderstanding. Sleep isn't lost time, or just a way to rest 
when all our important work is done. Instead, it's a critical function, during which your body balances
and regulates its vital systems, affecting respiration and regulating everything from circulation
to growth and immune response. That's great, but you can worry about 
all those things after this test, right? Well, not so fast. It turns out that sleep 
is also crucial for your brain, with a fifth of your body's 
circulatory blood being channeled to it as you drift off. And what goes on 
in your brain while you sleep is an intensely active period 
of restructuring that's crucial for how our memory works. At first glance, our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all. 19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material within the first twenty minutes, a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve. But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation, the process by which
information is moved from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory. This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain, known as the hippocampus. Its role in long-term memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner in her research with 
a patient known as H.M. After having his hippocampus removed, H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged, but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition. Due to the removal of his hippocampus, H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged. What this case revealed,
among other things, was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory, such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test, rather than procedural memory, such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital. Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's, have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works. Sensory data is initially transcribed and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory. From there, it travels to the hippocampus, which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area. Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity, new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons, and strengthening the neural network where the information will be returned
as long-term memory. So why do we remember
some things and not others? Well, there are a few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention. For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling, or even stress, will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion. But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is, you guessed it, a good night's sleep. Sleep is composed of four stages, the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement. EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages have shown electrical impulses moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation. And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate different types of memories. During the non-REM slow-wave sleep, declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store in the anterior part of the hippocampus. Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus, it is then repeatedly reactivated, driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex. REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity, is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory. So based on the studies, going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal. So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep not only harms your long-term health, but actually makes it less likely that you'll retain all that knowledge
and practice from the previous night, all of which just goes to affirm
the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it." When you think about 
all the internal restructuring and forming of new connections
that occurs while you slumber, you could even say that proper sleep will have you waking up every morning
with a new and improved brain, ready to face the challenges ahead.

is also crucial for your brain, with a fifth of your body's 
circulatory blood being channeled to it as you drift off. And what goes on 
in your brain while you sleep is an intensely active period 
of restructuring that's crucial for how our memory works. At first glance, our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all. 19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material within the first twenty minutes, a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve. But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation, the process by which
information is moved from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory. This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain, known as the hippocampus. Its role in long-term memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner in her research with 
a patient known as H.M. After having his hippocampus removed, H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged, but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition. Due to the removal of his hippocampus, H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged. What this case revealed,
among other things, was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory, such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test, rather than procedural memory, such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital. Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's, have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works. Sensory data is initially transcribed and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory. From there, it travels to the hippocampus, which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area. Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity, new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons, and strengthening the neural network where the information will be returned
as long-term memory. So why do we remember
some things and not others? Well, there are a few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention. For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling, or even stress, will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion. But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is, you guessed it, a good night's sleep. Sleep is composed of four stages, the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement. EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages have shown electrical impulses moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation. And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate different types of memories. During the non-REM slow-wave sleep, declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store in the anterior part of the hippocampus. Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus, it is then repeatedly reactivated, driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex. REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity, is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory. So based on the studies, going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal. So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep not only harms your long-term health, but actually makes it less likely that you'll retain all that knowledge
and practice from the previous night, all of which just goes to affirm
the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it." When you think about 
all the internal restructuring and forming of new connections
that occurs while you slumber, you could even say that proper sleep will have you waking up every morning
with a new and improved brain, ready to face the challenges ahead.

It's 4 a.m.,

the phenomenon known as "choking," where despite months, 
even years, of practice, a person fails right when it matters most. Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs 
under intense pressure and depends on key moments. And yet, performance anxiety 
also haunts public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and even world-famous musicians. Most people intuitively
blame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous 
undermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily, choking 
under pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers 
when the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention
on performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts 
compete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process 
so much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental “scratch pad” we use to temporarily store phone numbers 
and grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to pressure. In a 2004 study, 
a group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex 
and memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem
types with nothing at stake, while the others completed them 
when calm and under pressure. While everyone did well 
on the easy problems, those who were stressed 
performed worse on the more difficult, 
memory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up 
the second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They’re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze
the task at hand. Here, the logic goes that 
once a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics 
interferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be
most vulnerable to this kind of choking. A study on competitive golfers compared 
their performance when instructed to simply focus on
putting as accurately as possible, versus when they were primed 
to be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke. Golfers usually perform 
this action subconsciously, so those who suddenly tuned in 
to the precise details of their own moves also became worse 
at making accurate shots. Choking may not be inevitable 
for everyone though. Research suggests that some are
more susceptible than others, especially those who are self-conscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged 
negatively by others. So, how can we avoid choking 
when it really counts? First, it helps to practice 
under stressful conditions. In a study on expert dart players, researchers found that those 
who hadn’t practiced under stress performed worse when anxious, compared to those who had 
become accustomed to pressure. Secondly, many performers extol the 
virtues of a pre-performance routine, whether it’s taking a few deep breaths, repeating a cue word, or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements. Studies on golfing, bowling, 
and water polo find that short rituals can lead 
to more consistent and accurate performance under pressure. And thirdly, researchers have shown that having an external focus 
on the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus, where someone is tuned into the mechanics 
of what they’re doing. A study of experienced golfers revealed 
that those who hit chip shots while focused on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those
who focused on the motion of their arms. So, perhaps we can modify 
that age-old saying: practice, under pressure, with focus, and with that glorious end goal in sight, makes perfect.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, 
the discovery of two new drugs sparked what would become a multibillion 
dollar market for antidepressants. Neither drug was intended 
to treat depression at all— in fact, at the time, many doctors 
and scientists believed psychotherapy was the only approach 
to treating depression. The decades-long journey of discovery
that followed revolutionized our understanding 
of depression— and raised questions 
we hadn’t considered before. One of those first two antidepressant
drugs was ipronaizid, which was intended to treat tuberculosis. In a 1952 trial, 
it not only treated tuberculosis, it also improved the moods of patients who had previously been diagnosed 
with depression. In 1956, a Swiss clinician observed 
a similar effect when running a trial for imipramine, 
a drug for allergic reactions. Both drugs affected a class 
of neurotransmitters called monoamines. The discovery of these 
antidepressant drugs gave rise 
to the chemical imbalance theory, the idea that depression is caused
by having insufficient monoamines in the brain’s synapses. Ipronaizid, imipramine, 
and other drugs like them were thought to restore that balance by increasing the availability 
of monoamines in the brain. These drugs targeted several
different monoamines, each of which acted on a wide range
of receptors in the brain. This often meant a lot of side effects, including headaches, grogginess, 
and cognitive impairments including difficulty with memory, 
thinking, and judgment. Hoping to make the drugs more targeted 
and reduce side effects, scientists began studying existing 
antidepressants to figure out which specific monoamines 
were most associated with improvements in depression. In the 1970s, several different
researchers converged on an answer: the most effective antidepressants 
all seemed to act on one monoamine called serotonin. This discovery led to the production
of fluoxetine, or Prozac, in 1988. It was the first of a new class of drugs called Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI’s, which block the reabsorption of serotonin,
leaving more available in the brain. Prozac worked well 
and had fewer side effects than older, less targeted antidepressants. The makers of Prozac also worked 
to market the drug by raising awareness 
of the dangers of depression to both the public 
and the medical community. More people came to see depression 
as a disease caused by mechanisms beyond 
an individual’s control, which reduced the culture of blame 
and stigmatization surrounding depression, and more people sought help. In the 1990s, the number of people being
treated for depression skyrocketed. Psychotherapy and other treatments
fell by the wayside, and most people were treated 
solely with antidepressant drugs. Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced
view of how to treat depression— and of what causes it. Not everyone with depression responds 
to SSRIs like Prozac— some respond better to drugs 
that act on other neurotransmitters, or don't respond to medication at all. For many, a combination 
of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs is more effective than either alone. We’re also not sure why antidepressants
work the way they do: they change monoamine levels within
a few hours of taking the medication, but patients usually don’t feel
the benefit until weeks later. And after they stop 
taking antidepressants, some patients never experience 
depression again, while others relapse. We now recognize that we don’t
know what causes depression, or why anti-depressants work. The chemical imbalance theory 
is at best an incomplete explanation. It can’t be a coincidence that almost all
the antidepressants happen to act on serotonin, but that doesn’t mean serotonin deficiency
is the cause of depression. If that sounds odd, 
consider a more straightforward example: steroid creams can treat rashes
caused by poison ivy— the fact that they work doesn’t mean
steroid deficiency was the cause of the rash. We still have a ways to go in terms 
of understanding this disease. Fortunately, in the meantime, 
we have effective tools to treat it.

with depression. In 1956, a Swiss clinician observed 
a similar effect when running a trial for imipramine, 
a drug for allergic reactions. Both drugs affected a class 
of neurotransmitters called monoamines. The discovery of these 
antidepressant drugs gave rise 
to the chemical imbalance theory, the idea that depression is caused
by having insufficient monoamines in the brain’s synapses. Ipronaizid, imipramine, 
and other drugs like them were thought to restore that balance by increasing the availability 
of monoamines in the brain. These drugs targeted several
different monoamines, each of which acted on a wide range
of receptors in the brain. This often meant a lot of side effects, including headaches, grogginess, 
and cognitive impairments including difficulty with memory, 
thinking, and judgment. Hoping to make the drugs more targeted 
and reduce side effects, scientists began studying existing 
antidepressants to figure out which specific monoamines 
were most associated with improvements in depression. In the 1970s, several different
researchers converged on an answer: the most effective antidepressants 
all seemed to act on one monoamine called serotonin. This discovery led to the production
of fluoxetine, or Prozac, in 1988. It was the first of a new class of drugs called Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI’s, which block the reabsorption of serotonin,
leaving more available in the brain. Prozac worked well 
and had fewer side effects than older, less targeted antidepressants. The makers of Prozac also worked 
to market the drug by raising awareness 
of the dangers of depression to both the public 
and the medical community. More people came to see depression 
as a disease caused by mechanisms beyond 
an individual’s control, which reduced the culture of blame 
and stigmatization surrounding depression, and more people sought help. In the 1990s, the number of people being
treated for depression skyrocketed. Psychotherapy and other treatments
fell by the wayside, and most people were treated 
solely with antidepressant drugs. Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced
view of how to treat depression— and of what causes it. Not everyone with depression responds 
to SSRIs like Prozac— some respond better to drugs 
that act on other neurotransmitters, or don't respond to medication at all. For many, a combination 
of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs is more effective than either alone. We’re also not sure why antidepressants
work the way they do: they change monoamine levels within
a few hours of taking the medication, but patients usually don’t feel
the benefit until weeks later. And after they stop 
taking antidepressants, some patients never experience 
depression again, while others relapse. We now recognize that we don’t
know what causes depression, or why anti-depressants work. The chemical imbalance theory 
is at best an incomplete explanation. It can’t be a coincidence that almost all
the antidepressants happen to act on serotonin, but that doesn’t mean serotonin deficiency
is the cause of depression. If that sounds odd, 
consider a more straightforward example: steroid creams can treat rashes
caused by poison ivy— the fact that they work doesn’t mean
steroid deficiency was the cause of the rash. We still have a ways to go in terms 
of understanding this disease. Fortunately, in the meantime, 
we have effective tools to treat it.

**Transcript**:
Each person who entered our therapy clinic answer a stack of questions
before beginning treatment. And during my years as a therapist there, there was one question I always reviewed
before meeting with a new client. It asked this: What is your purpose in life? Defined as a central motivating life aim,
something you're trying to accomplish. Now, to be fair,
this is a difficult question. Identifying a single purpose
in life feels really hard. It also feels consequential. Many people spend years searching for
and developing their purposes, and some never find it. But typically we see responses like this: to be an engaged parent, to make meaningful change in my community, to build a career I'm proud of, to live for a long time,
just keeping it simple. But then there was the answer
of one young woman who I worked with. Before meeting with her, as I always did, I flipped to see
how she described her purpose. And she wrote this: "To avoid being noticed by other people." This young woman, a bright, witty,
compassionate high schooler, decided that her purpose in life was to make sure that other people
did not know that she existed. This is the power of social anxiety. At its core, social anxiety
is about the fear of being rejected. When we feel socially anxious, we become hyper-focused
on how we are appearing to others. We scan the room looking for signs
of threat and disapproval, signs we might have slipped up
and are at risk for rejection. And then we seek comfort
in signs of approval, smiles, head nods, laughs and so on. And while social anxiety
can be exhausting, it exists for a reason. Social anxiety tries
to protect us from rejection, and it does that by tuning us in
to the nuances and norms and dynamics of a social group so we can match our behavior
to fit in with them and ultimately avoid being rejected. This is a good thing
because humans are social. We exist in social groups, we rely on each other
whether or not we like that, but also more simply
because rejection is painful. Take a moment to think
about your own rejection experiences, however cringeworthy, we all have them. Maybe you were ghosted after a first date. Been there. Maybe you were rejected
from your dream job. Maybe you were ousted from a friend group. Rejection's unpleasant. And social anxiety
tries to protect us from it. But social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere
with the life you want to live. And this happens
when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined
with your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have
some inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not
lovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not
intelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not
interesting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really
a fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe
society wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop
into social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned
about other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly
and ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct
their lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being
noticed by other people, then those people have fewer data
points on which to reject you. Now, social anxiety disorder is one of the most common
mental illnesses in the world. In the United States alone, more than 12 percent of Americans
at some point in their lives will have diagnosable
social anxiety disorder. That's roughly 40 million people. Now worldwide, the estimates
are lower, they're four percent, which in and of itself is interesting. But based on current population estimates, four percent of the world
is roughly 300 million people that will potentially have
social anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. And despite how prevalent it is,
it's widely misunderstood, widely misdiagnosed and often missed entirely. This is because several myths
about social anxiety pervade our culture. The first myth is that people
with social anxiety are happier alone. The stereotype of someone
with social anxiety as a recluse who'd rather be hiding away
alone in their bedroom than out interacting with the world. And this is simply not true. In research conducted in my lab, we find that people
with social anxiety disorder desire strong, healthy,
intimate relationships to the same degree
as those without mental illness. And they do socialize, they’re not robotic aliens. And when they socialize, they often enjoy doing so. In fact, when we ask people
with social anxiety how happy they are, they report feeling happier
when they are with other people than when they're alone. This is because not all social
interactions are stressful. Maybe someone feels
socially anxious with friends but not their romantic partner. Or they feel anxious with strangers
and acquaintances but not people like their
neighbors or coworkers. So even though some
interactions are stressful, people with social anxiety are not devoid
of the basic desire for human connection. They just have trouble obtaining it
in certain situations with certain people. OK, so maybe then people
with social anxiety do socialize, and when they do, they enjoy it. But it's with a small,
tight-knit group of people. And really, social anxiety is about
avoiding the spotlight. And this is the second myth. Social anxiety is not necessarily
about a fear of public performance. While this is true of some people, other people with social anxiety
find performing in front of others less anxiety-provoking than smaller, more intimate conversations, like when they have to carry
a conversation one on one. Many people with social anxiety
excel in careers that are intertwined with social
evaluation and social performance. Modeling, acting, sports. In May of 2021, Naomi Osaka declined to participate
in press conferences of the French Open. She courageously and preemptively shared that they exacerbated her social anxiety. Shortly thereafter, she received a wave
of public backlash and scrutiny. She goes on to play her first match, of course, wins, and then she withdraws
from the French Open. Many people were perplexed about how someone
could have social anxiety and also be the number one ranked
tennis player in the world, lead a fashion campaign
with Nike -- good choice -- and don the cover of Sports
Illustrated in a swimsuit. In an interview the year prior
discussing her social anxiety, Osaka explained: "On the court is completely different. I love playing at Arthur Ashe
because it’s the biggest stadium, and you feel the rumble of the crowd. You kind of feel like a gladiator
because it’s super-big and there are so many people
watching your match. But off the court, if I was ever thrown into a situation where I had to speak
in front of 100 people, I feel like I would start shaking." There is no one-size-fits-all
profile of social anxiety. Just like people who are depressed
have different collections of symptoms at different times for different reasons, social anxiety looks different
in different people. And last and maybe
the most problematic myth. That social anxiety
is fleeting and harmless. Social anxiety is not just
something you grow out of. It doesn't magically disappear when you graduate
middle school or high school. Without intervention, many people struggle
with social anxiety for years, for decades. And social anxiety can influence
every aspect of a person's life. It can influence the hobbies they choose, maybe opting for solo activities
like reading, writing, rather than things like team sports. It can influence
the careers people pursue. Maybe opting for careers
with more individual, like computer time, versus things like sales
or customer service. And social anxiety could influence
people's everyday lives. Ricky Williams, star NFL running back, Heisman-winning running back, dazzled millions of people
on the football field every week. And yet he shared that he struggled
with social anxiety, and because of it, he had difficulty interacting
with teammates, running everyday errands where he'd have to interact with people and even interacting
with his own daughter. The real tragedy of social anxiety is that it robs individuals
of their greatest resource: other people. Other people help us overcome adversity, like recovering from illness
or after you bomb a job interview. Other people help us celebrate milestones like showing up to the birth of our child
or a wedding or a graduation. And other people help us overcome loss, like grieving the death of a loved one. Our fear of rejection gets in the way
of obtaining and appreciating the benefits of being accepted,
the benefits of other people. And in our modern world, it is harder than ever
to manage social anxiety. We are more connected today
than any time in human history, and yet we are lonelier, more depressed and more socially anxious than ever. We have endless tools to socialize, and yet we're seeing
a decaying social connection. In a rapid amount of time, our social structures have been
upended and rewritten. Technology and social media
have created new standards for social relationships and interactions: "Do I post it, do I share it,
do I like it, do I love it?" We create these bizarre
extensions of ourselves through curated profiles and now avatars. We try to make sense of unlimited feedback from a massive and often
invisible audience. And the costs of social
blunders are higher. Things you do and things you say
can live online forever and subject you to unforgiving scrutiny, reputation loss and even job loss. It is a tough time to have social anxiety. But the world will become more,
not less, connected, and the influence of technology
and social media will grow, not shrink. Now is the time to address social anxiety. And here's how. The first and maybe easiest thing
we can do is identify early. Early detection is critical because of those who go on
to develop social anxiety disorder, more than half will have developed it
before their 14th birthday. More than half. And social anxiety puts people at risk for developing other
mental illnesses later on. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression, social anxiety came first
70 percent of the time. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, social anxiety came first. It was developed first approximately
80 percent of the time. What these data suggests
is that social anxiety starts early, and it puts people at risk
for developing other mental illnesses. But here's the incredible part. Social anxiety can be reliably
and accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions. Questions like: "Is your fear of rejection
among one of your worst fears?" And "Does your fear of rejection
get in the way of doing things that you'd otherwise
want to be or enjoy doing?" The cost of asking these questions
is like 30 seconds and zero dollars. We don't have to create
new infrastructures. We don't have to upend existing ones. We can embed early detection programs
into our existing structures like at schools, new year orientation, one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings. Because if a doctor
can screen for depression, then she can also screen
for social anxiety. Early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter
the trajectories of young people. The second thing we can do
is harness our platforms. One of the benefits of living
in this hyperconnected world is that a single person
can have a ton of power. They can use their platforms to create
meaningful and lasting social change. I mentioned Ricky Williams and Osaka, who have used their platforms to share
about their social anxiety. And just from these two people,
we’ve seen a ripple effect. In response to Osaka's announcement, Viola Davis, Oscar, Emmy, Tony-award winning actress, shared that she struggles
with social anxiety. A woman whose job it is as an actress to embody and express
the complexities of people in very vulnerable and very public ways. But frankly, these celebrities are not
the poster children for social anxiety. They're just three
of the millions who suffer, who were brave enough to talk about it. And we can do the same with our platforms,
however big or small. In our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities and in our homes. Because regular, candid and forthcoming
conversations about mental illness ultimately reduce stigma, correct harmful myths and get people the help that they need. The last thing that we can do
is foster social courage. Addressing social anxiety is not
about preventing or avoiding rejection. Addressing social anxiety
is about fostering social courage. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences and knowing that your chances
of rejection are not zero. In fact, the chances that you get rejected
at some point in your life, at some point this year, are high. And worse, you may be rejected
as a function of who you are. Things about yourself
that you cannot change. Where you come from, what you look like or who you love. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences because they are important to you and knowing that the successes
of those pursuits are not contingent
on your worth as a human being. Being socially courageous
means knowing your worth and finding people and social groups that love and accept that person. And being socially courageous
means asking that person out, applying for that job, speaking up at that meeting or that party or giving that big talk on that big stage, knowing that rejection lurks
around the corner. But the opportunity for growth
and for purpose shines brighter. A purpose not defined by ensuring
that you go unnoticed in this world, but a purpose that makes you feel
most alive, most present and most authentically you. Thank you.

with both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression, social anxiety came first
70 percent of the time. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, social anxiety came first. It was developed first approximately
80 percent of the time. What these data suggests
is that social anxiety starts early, and it puts people at risk
for developing other mental illnesses. But here's the incredible part. Social anxiety can be reliably
and accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions. Questions like: "Is your fear of rejection
among one of your worst fears?" And "Does your fear of rejection
get in the way of doing things that you'd otherwise
want to be or enjoy doing?" The cost of asking these questions
is like 30 seconds and zero dollars. We don't have to create
new infrastructures. We don't have to upend existing ones. We can embed early detection programs
into our existing structures like at schools, new year orientation, one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings. Because if a doctor
can screen for depression, then she can also screen
for social anxiety. Early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter
the trajectories of young people. The second thing we can do
is harness our platforms. One of the benefits of living
in this hyperconnected world is that a single person
can have a ton of power. They can use their platforms to create
meaningful and lasting social change. I mentioned Ricky Williams and Osaka, who have used their platforms to share
about their social anxiety. And just from these two people,
we’ve seen a ripple effect. In response to Osaka's announcement, Viola Davis, Oscar, Emmy, Tony-award winning actress, shared that she struggles
with social anxiety. A woman whose job it is as an actress to embody and express
the complexities of people in very vulnerable and very public ways. But frankly, these celebrities are not
the poster children for social anxiety. They're just three
of the millions who suffer, who were brave enough to talk about it. And we can do the same with our platforms,
however big or small. In our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities and in our homes. Because regular, candid and forthcoming
conversations about mental illness ultimately reduce stigma, correct harmful myths and get people the help that they need. The last thing that we can do
is foster social courage. Addressing social anxiety is not
about preventing or avoiding rejection. Addressing social anxiety
is about fostering social courage. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences and knowing that your chances
of rejection are not zero. In fact, the chances that you get rejected
at some point in your life, at some point this year, are high. And worse, you may be rejected
as a function of who you are. Things about yourself
that you cannot change. Where you come from, what you look like or who you love. Being socially courageous
means pursuing experiences because they are important to you and knowing that the successes
of those pursuits are not contingent
on your worth as a human being. Being socially courageous
means knowing your worth and finding people and social groups that love and accept that person. And being socially courageous
means asking that person out, applying for that job, speaking up at that meeting or that party or giving that big talk on that big stage, knowing that rejection lurks
around the corner. But the opportunity for growth
and for purpose shines brighter. A purpose not defined by ensuring
that you go unnoticed in this world, but a purpose that makes you feel
most alive, most present and most authentically you. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Each person who entered our therapy clinic answer a stack of questions
before beginning treatment. And during my years as a therapist there, there was one question I always reviewed
before meeting with a new client. It asked this: What is your purpose in life? Defined as a central motivating life aim,
something you're trying to accomplish. Now, to be fair,
this is a difficult question. Identifying a single purpose
in life feels really hard. It also feels consequential. Many people spend years searching for
and developing their purposes, and some never find it. But typically we see responses like this: to be an engaged parent, to make meaningful change in my community, to build a career I'm proud of, to live for a long time,
just keeping it simple. But then there was the answer
of one young woman who I worked with. Before meeting with her, as I always did, I flipped to see
how she described her purpose. And she wrote this: "To avoid being noticed by other people." This young woman, a bright, witty,
compassionate high schooler, decided that her purpose in life was to make sure that other people
did not know that she existed. This is the power of social anxiety. At its core, social anxiety
is about the fear of being rejected. When we feel socially anxious, we become hyper-focused
on how we are appearing to others. We scan the room looking for signs
of threat and disapproval, signs we might have slipped up
and are at risk for rejection. And then we seek comfort
in signs of approval, smiles, head nods, laughs and so on. And while social anxiety
can be exhausting, it exists for a reason. Social anxiety tries
to protect us from rejection, and it does that by tuning us in
to the nuances and norms and dynamics of a social group so we can match our behavior
to fit in with them and ultimately avoid being rejected. This is a good thing
because humans are social. We exist in social groups, we rely on each other
whether or not we like that, but also more simply
because rejection is painful. Take a moment to think
about your own rejection experiences, however cringeworthy, we all have them. Maybe you were ghosted after a first date. Been there. Maybe you were rejected
from your dream job. Maybe you were ousted from a friend group. Rejection's unpleasant. And social anxiety
tries to protect us from it. But social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere
with the life you want to live. And this happens
when your fear of rejection becomes intertwined
with your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have
some inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not
lovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not
intelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not
interesting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really
a fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe
society wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop
into social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned
about other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly
and ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct
their lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being
noticed by other people, then those people have fewer data
points on which to reject you. Now, social anxiety disorder is one of the most common
mental illnesses in the world. In the United States alone, more than 12 percent of Americans
at some point in their lives will have diagnosable
social anxiety disorder. That's roughly 40 million people. Now worldwide, the estimates
are lower, they're four percent, which in and of itself is interesting. But based on current population estimates, four percent of the world
is roughly 300 million people that will potentially have
social anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. And despite how prevalent it is,
it's widely misunderstood, widely misdiagnosed and often missed entirely. This is because several myths
about social anxiety pervade our culture. The first myth is that people
with social anxiety are happier alone. The stereotype of someone
with social anxiety as a recluse who'd rather be hiding away
alone in their bedroom than out interacting with the world. And this is simply not true. In research conducted in my lab, we find that people
with social anxiety disorder desire strong, healthy,
intimate relationships to the same degree
as those without mental illness. And they do socialize, they’re not robotic aliens. And when they socialize, they often enjoy doing so. In fact, when we ask people
with social anxiety how happy they are, they report feeling happier
when they are with other people than when they're alone. This is because not all social
interactions are stressful. Maybe someone feels
socially anxious with friends but not their romantic partner. Or they feel anxious with strangers
and acquaintances but not people like their
neighbors or coworkers. So even though some
interactions are stressful, people with social anxiety are not devoid
of the basic desire for human connection. They just have trouble obtaining it
in certain situations with certain people. OK, so maybe then people
with social anxiety do socialize, and when they do, they enjoy it. But it's with a small,
tight-knit group of people. And really, social anxiety is about
avoiding the spotlight. And this is the second myth. Social anxiety is not necessarily
about a fear of public performance. While this is true of some people, other people with social anxiety
find performing in front of others less anxiety-provoking than smaller, more intimate conversations, like when they have to carry
a conversation one on one. Many people with social anxiety
excel in careers that are intertwined with social
evaluation and social performance. Modeling, acting, sports. In May of 2021, Naomi Osaka declined to participate
in press conferences of the French Open. She courageously and preemptively shared that they exacerbated her social anxiety. Shortly thereafter, she received a wave
of public backlash and scrutiny. She goes on to play her first match, of course, wins, and then she withdraws
from the French Open. Many people were perplexed about how someone
could have social anxiety and also be the number one ranked
tennis player in the world, lead a fashion campaign
with Nike -- good choice -- and don the cover of Sports
Illustrated in a swimsuit. In an interview the year prior
discussing her social anxiety, Osaka explained: "On the court is completely different. I love playing at Arthur Ashe
because it’s the biggest stadium, and you feel the rumble of the crowd. You kind of feel like a gladiator
because it’s super-big and there are so many people
watching your match. But off the court, if I was ever thrown into a situation where I had to speak
in front of 100 people, I feel like I would start shaking." There is no one-size-fits-all
profile of social anxiety. Just like people who are depressed
have different collections of symptoms at different times for different reasons, social anxiety looks different
in different people. And last and maybe
the most problematic myth. That social anxiety
is fleeting and harmless. Social anxiety is not just
something you grow out of. It doesn't magically disappear when you graduate
middle school or high school. Without intervention, many people struggle
with social anxiety for years, for decades. And social anxiety can influence
every aspect of a person's life. It can influence the hobbies they choose, maybe opting for solo activities
like reading, writing, rather than things like team sports. It can influence
the careers people pursue. Maybe opting for careers
with more individual, like computer time, versus things like sales
or customer service. And social anxiety could influence
people's everyday lives. Ricky Williams, star NFL running back, Heisman-winning running back, dazzled millions of people
on the football field every week. And yet he shared that he struggled
with social anxiety, and because of it, he had difficulty interacting
with teammates, running everyday errands where he'd have to interact with people and even interacting
with his own daughter. The real tragedy of social anxiety is that it robs individuals
of their greatest resource: other people. Other people help us overcome adversity, like recovering from illness
or after you bomb a job interview. Other people help us celebrate milestones like showing up to the birth of our child
or a wedding or a graduation. And other people help us overcome loss, like grieving the death of a loved one. Our fear of rejection gets in the way
of obtaining and appreciating the benefits of being accepted,
the benefits of other people. And in our modern world, it is harder than ever
to manage social anxiety. We are more connected today
than any time in human history, and yet we are lonelier, more depressed and more socially anxious than ever. We have endless tools to socialize, and yet we're seeing
a decaying social connection. In a rapid amount of time, our social structures have been
upended and rewritten. Technology and social media
have created new standards for social relationships and interactions: "Do I post it, do I share it,
do I like it, do I love it?" We create these bizarre
extensions of ourselves through curated profiles and now avatars. We try to make sense of unlimited feedback from a massive and often
invisible audience. And the costs of social
blunders are higher. Things you do and things you say
can live online forever and subject you to unforgiving scrutiny, reputation loss and even job loss. It is a tough time to have social anxiety. But the world will become more,
not less, connected, and the influence of technology
and social media will grow, not shrink. Now is the time to address social anxiety. And here's how. The first and maybe easiest thing
we can do is identify early. Early detection is critical because of those who go on
to develop social anxiety disorder, more than half will have developed it
before their 14th birthday. More than half. And social anxiety puts people at risk for developing other
mental illnesses later on. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression, social anxiety came first
70 percent of the time. Of adults who were diagnosed
with both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, social anxiety came first. It was developed first approximately
80 percent of the time. What these data suggests
is that social anxiety starts early, and it puts people at risk

and accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions. Questions like: "Is your fear of rejection

is like 30 seconds and zero dollars. We don't have to create
new infrastructures. We don't have to upend existing ones. We can embed early detection programs
into our existing structures like at schools, new year orientation, one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings. Because if a doctor
can screen for depression, then she can also screen
for social anxiety. Early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter
the trajectories of young people. The second thing we can do
is harness our platforms. One of the benefits of living
in this hyperconnected world is that a single person
can have a ton of power. They can use their platforms to create
meaningful and lasting social change. I mentioned Ricky Williams and Osaka, who have used their platforms to share
about their social anxiety. And just from these two people,

**Transcript**:
Friendships can hold an exceptional
place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step.

feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step.

**Transcript**:
Friendships can hold an exceptional
place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks

**Transcript**:
The body becomes its own corset. Past, present, and future 
exist as a single force. A swing without gravity soars 
to a terrifying height. The outlines of people and things 
dissolve. Countless poets and writers 
have tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack— a sensation so overwhelming, many people 
mistake it for a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don’t cause 
long-term physical harm, afterwards, the fear of another attack 
can limit someone’s daily life— and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one 
panic attack in our lives. And whether it’s your first, 
your hundredth, or you’re witnessing someone else 
go through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can 
be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary— because the first step to preventing 
panic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack 
is an overreaction to the body’s normal physiological response 
to the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved 
in processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates 
the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase 
in the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen 
to the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, 
making it more alert and responsive. During a panic attack, this response is exaggerated 
well past what would be useful in a dangerous situation, causing a racing heart, heavy breathing, 
or hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow 
cause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks 
within 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex 
takes over from the amygdala and stimulates 
the parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone 
called acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate 
and gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body’s 
perception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would
have to a real threat— and then some. We don't know for sure 
why this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment 
that remind us of traumatic past experience 
can trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part 
of anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, 
and generalized anxiety disorder. Recurring panic attacks, 
frequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes 
to avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis 
of a panic disorder. The two main treatments 
for panic disorder are antidepressant medication 
and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate— though someone who responds to one 
may not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications 
carry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse 
when they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, 
with only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic 
disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools 
to exert physical, and in turn mental, control over the sensations and thoughts 
associated with a panic attack. CBT begins with an explanation of the 
physiological causes of a panic attack, followed by breath and muscle exercises 
designed to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying 
and changing the thoughts that are common during attacks— such as believing you’ll stop breathing, 
have a heart attack, or die— and replacing them 
with more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure 
to the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief, 
through experience, that these sensations and situations 
are dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps 
isn’t easy in the grip of an attack. But with practice, these tools 
can both prevent and de-escalate attacks, and ultimately reduce the hold of panic 
on a person’s life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same 
beliefs CBT aims to instill: that fear can’t hurt you, 
but holding on to it will escalate panic. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify 
one in yourself or someone else— and recognizing them is the first step 
in preventing them.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The body becomes its own corset. Past, present, and future 
exist as a single force. A swing without gravity soars 
to a terrifying height. The outlines of people and things 
dissolve. Countless poets and writers 
have tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack— a sensation so overwhelming, many people 
mistake it for a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don’t cause 
long-term physical harm, afterwards, the fear of another attack 
can limit someone’s daily life— and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one 
panic attack in our lives. And whether it’s your first, 
your hundredth, or you’re witnessing someone else 
go through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can 
be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary— because the first step to preventing 
panic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack 
is an overreaction to the body’s normal physiological response 
to the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved 
in processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates 
the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase 
in the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen 
to the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, 
making it more alert and responsive. During a panic attack, this response is exaggerated 
well past what would be useful in a dangerous situation, causing a racing heart, heavy breathing, 
or hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow 
cause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks 
within 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex 
takes over from the amygdala and stimulates 
the parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone 
called acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate 
and gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body’s 
perception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would
have to a real threat— and then some. We don't know for sure 
why this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment 
that remind us of traumatic past experience 
can trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part 
of anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, 
and generalized anxiety disorder. Recurring panic attacks, 
frequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes 
to avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis 
of a panic disorder. The two main treatments 
for panic disorder are antidepressant medication 
and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate— though someone who responds to one 
may not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications 
carry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse 
when they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, 
with only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic 
disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools 
to exert physical, and in turn mental, control over the sensations and thoughts 
associated with a panic attack. CBT begins with an explanation of the 
physiological causes of a panic attack, followed by breath and muscle exercises 
designed to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying 
and changing the thoughts that are common during attacks— such as believing you’ll stop breathing, 
have a heart attack, or die— and replacing them 
with more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure 
to the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief, 
through experience, that these sensations and situations 
are dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps 
isn’t easy in the grip of an attack. But with practice, these tools 
can both prevent and de-escalate attacks, and ultimately reduce the hold of panic 
on a person’s life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same 
beliefs CBT aims to instill: that fear can’t hurt you, 
but holding on to it will escalate panic. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify 
one in yourself or someone else— and recognizing them is the first step 
in preventing them.

**Transcript**:
In March of 1892, three Black grocery store owners 
in Memphis, Tennessee, were murdered by a mob of white men. Lynchings like these were happening 
all over the American South, often without any subsequent legal 
investigation or consequences for the murderers. But this time, a young journalist and 
friend of the victims set out to expose the truth 
about these killings. Her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an 
investigative journalist, civic leader, and civil rights advocate. Her name was Ida B. Wells. Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery 
in Holly Springs, Mississippi on July 16, 1862, several months before
the Emancipation Proclamation released her and her family. After losing both parents and a brother 
to yellow fever at the age of 16, she supported her five remaining siblings by working as a schoolteacher 
in Memphis, Tennessee. During this time, she began working as a journalist. Writing under the pen name “Iola,” by the early 1890s she gained 
a reputation as a clear voice against racial injustice and become co-owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech 
and Headlight newspaper. She had no shortage of material: in the decades following the Civil War, Southern whites attempted to reassert 
their power by committing crimes against Black people including suppressing their votes, vandalizing their businesses, 
and even murdering them. After the murder of her friends, Wells launched an investigation 
into lynching. She analyzed specific cases through 
newspaper reports and police records, and interviewed people who had lost 
friends and family to lynch mobs. She risked her life 
to get this information. As a Black person investigating racially 
motivated murders, she enraged many of the same southern 
white men involved in lynchings. Her bravery paid off. Most whites had claimed and 
subsequently reported that lynchings were responses to criminal
acts by Black people. But that was not usually the case. Through her research, Wells showed that these murders 
were actually a deliberate, brutal tactic to control or punish 
black people who competed with whites. Her friends, for example, had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business 
from a white competitor. Wells published her findings in 1892. In response, a white mob destroyed 
her newspaper presses. She was out of town when they struck, but they threatened to kill her 
if she ever returned to Memphis. So she traveled to New York, where that same year she re-published 
her research in a pamphlet titled Southern Horrors: Lynch Law 
in All Its Phases. In 1895, after settling in Chicago, she built on Southern Horrors in a longer 
piece called The Red Record. Her careful documentation of the horrors 
of lynching and impassioned public speeches 
drew international attention. Wells used her newfound fame 
to amplify her message. She traveled to Europe, where she rallied European outrage against
racial violence in the American South in hopes that the US government and public
would follow their example. Back in the US, she didn’t hesitate to confront powerful 
organizations, fighting the segregationist 
policies of the YMCA and leading a delegation 
to the White House to protest discriminatory 
workplace practices. She did all this while 
disenfranchised herself. Women didn’t win the right to vote 
until Wells was in her late 50s. And even then, the vote was primarily 
extended to white women only. Wells was a key player in the battle 
for voting inclusion, starting a Black women’s 
suffrage organization in Chicago. But in spite of her deep commitment 
to women’s rights, she clashed with white leaders 
of the movement. During a march for women’s 
suffrage in Washington D.C., she ignored the organizers’ attempt 
to placate Southern bigotry by placing Black women in the back, and marched up front alongside
the white women. She also chafed with other 
civil rights leaders, who saw her as a dangerous radical. She insisted on airing, in full detail, 
the atrocities taking place in the South, while others thought doing so would be 
counterproductive to negotiations with white politicians. Although she participated in the founding 
of the NAACP, she was soon sidelined 
from the organization. Wells’ unwillingness to compromise any 
aspect of her vision of justice shined a light on the weak points 
of the various rights movements, and ultimately made them stronger— but also made it difficult for her 
to find a place within them. She was ahead of her time, waging a tireless struggle 
for equality and justice decades before many had even begun

**Transcript**:
In March of 1892, three Black grocery store owners 
in Memphis, Tennessee, were murdered by a mob of white men. Lynchings like these were happening 
all over the American South, often without any subsequent legal 
investigation or consequences for the murderers. But this time, a young journalist and 
friend of the victims set out to expose the truth 
about these killings. Her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an 
investigative journalist, civic leader, and civil rights advocate. Her name was Ida B. Wells. Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery 
in Holly Springs, Mississippi on July 16, 1862, several months before
the Emancipation Proclamation released her and her family. After losing both parents and a brother

**Transcript**:
On December 12, 1904, 
Chief Lontulu laid 110 twigs in front of a foreign commission. Every twig represented a person 
in his village who died because of King Leopold’s horrific regime
in the Congo— all in the name of rubber. Chief Lontulu separated the twigs 
into four piles: tribal nobles, men, women, and children— then proceeded
to name the dead of one-by-one. His testimony joined hundreds of others
to help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities 
in history. Beginning in the late 1800s, European countries participated in the
so-called “Scramble for Africa.” They colonized 90% of the continent, exploiting African resources 
and enriching their countries. Belgium had recently become
an independent kingdom. Its ruler, Leopold II, 
wanted to acquire what he called “a slice of this magnificent 
African cake.” Meanwhile, he read colonial explorer 
Henry Morton Stanley’s reports about traveling through Africa. Stanley emphasized 
the Congo basin’s majesty. So, in 1879, Leopold contracted him
to return to the Congo. There, Stanley deceived leaders 
into signing some 450 treaties allowing for land use. Leopold persuaded the US and European
powers to grant him ownership of the Congo, pledging to protect free trade 
in the region. And on May 29, 1885, a territory more than
80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people was declared
his own private colony— by no one it actually belonged to. Leopold lost no time consolidating power 
in what he called the Congo Free State. He claimed land, raised an army, and forced many Congolese men
to complete unpaid labor. Things got even worse when, in 1887, a Scottish inventor redeveloped
the pneumatic tire, creating a massive international
market for rubber. The Congo had one of the world’s
largest supplies. Leopold seized the opportunity, requiring villages to meet 
ever-greater rubber quotas. Congolese men had to harvest
the material from wild vines. As supplies drained, they walked for days
to gather enough. Leopold’s army entered villages and held 
women and children hostage until the impossible quota was met. Soldiers sexually violated women 
and deprived children of food and water. Congolese people rebelled— they refused to cooperate, 
fought Leopold’s soldiers, hid in the forests, 
and destroyed rubber vines. Leopold’s army responded to resistance 
or failure to meet quotas with unflinching torture and executions. Because guns and ammunition
were expensive, officers ordered soldiers to prove they 
used their bullets in the line of duty by removing a hand from anyone 
they killed. However, many soldiers hunted 
using their guns. To avoid harsh penalties and account 
for lost bullets, they cut off living people’s hands. They also used this practice
as punishment. If rubber quotas weren’t met, soldiers would sever people’s hands
and bring them to their commanders instead of rubber. The regime dramatically upended
daily life and agriculture, causing widespread starvation and disease. Meanwhile, King Leopold built monuments 
and private estates with the wealth he extracted. Soon, people brought international
attention to the horrific abuses of Leopold’s Congo Free State. In 1890, American journalist 
George Washington Williams accused King Leopold of “deceit, fraud, 
robberies, arson, murder, slave-raiding,
and [a] general policy of cruelty.” In 1903, Diplomat Roger Casement 
wrote a report that corroborated the nature and scale of the atrocities. It was published the following year. In response, Leopold appointed his own 
commission to investigate the accusations. They heard numerous witness statements 
in the Congo— Chief Lontulu’s included. The report only confirmed the worst. Facing pressure, Leopold relinquished 
control of the Congo to the Belgian government in 1908. But this did not mean justice. The Belgian state awarded Leopold
50 million francs “in testimony for his great sacrifice 
in favor of the Congo.” He died the following year. Crowds booed his funeral procession. For more than 50 years following,
the Congo remained a Belgian colony, until declaring independence in 1960. That year, the Congo elected its first
prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. But months later, he was unseated 
in a US and Belgium backed coup. In early 1961, Lumumba was assassinated 
under Belgian supervision. The coup launched the country 
into a decades-long dictatorship. Around 10 million Congolese people 
are thought to have died during Leopold’s occupation and looting 
of the Congo. Despite this devastation, calls 
for reparations have gone unanswered. To this day, throughout Belgium can be 
found the monuments King Leopold built on a foundation of inconceivable cruelty.

**Transcript**:
On December 12, 1904, 
Chief Lontulu laid 110 twigs in front of a foreign commission. Every twig represented a person 
in his village who died because of King Leopold’s horrific regime
in the Congo— all in the name of rubber. Chief Lontulu separated the twigs 
into four piles: tribal nobles, men, women, and children— then proceeded
to name the dead of one-by-one. His testimony joined hundreds of others
to help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities 
in history. Beginning in the late 1800s, European countries participated in the
so-called “Scramble for Africa.” They colonized 90% of the continent, exploiting African resources 
and enriching their countries. Belgium had recently become
an independent kingdom. Its ruler, Leopold II, 
wanted to acquire what he called “a slice of this magnificent 
African cake.” Meanwhile, he read colonial explorer 
Henry Morton Stanley’s reports about traveling through Africa. Stanley emphasized 
the Congo basin’s majesty. So, in 1879, Leopold contracted him
to return to the Congo. There, Stanley deceived leaders 
into signing some 450 treaties allowing for land use. Leopold persuaded the US and European
powers to grant him ownership of the Congo, pledging to protect free trade 
in the region. And on May 29, 1885, a territory more than
80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people was declared
his own private colony— by no one it actually belonged to. Leopold lost no time consolidating power 
in what he called the Congo Free State. He claimed land, raised an army, and forced many Congolese men
to complete unpaid labor. Things got even worse when, in 1887, a Scottish inventor redeveloped
the pneumatic tire, creating a massive international
market for rubber. The Congo had one of the world’s
largest supplies. Leopold seized the opportunity, requiring villages to meet 
ever-greater rubber quotas. Congolese men had to harvest

and deprived children of food and water. Congolese people rebelled— they refused to cooperate,

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In early 1828, Sojourner Truth approached
the Grand Jury of Kingston, New York. She had no experience 
with the legal system, no money, and no power 
in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for
custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold 
to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out 
over the next several months, Truth raised funds, 
strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, 
Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate 
the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding. Truth was born into slavery 
as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century
in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced 
the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of 
indentured servitude until their mid-20s. Throughout this period, 
enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented 
from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man 
named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep 
her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition 
threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, 
had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, 
Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able 
to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children 
remained in bondage. It would be two years before 
she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait 
another two years before she saw any of her other children. During this time, 
Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated 
to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community 
that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking 
aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers
took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice 
of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known 
as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on 
Biblical references, spiritual ideals, 
and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression 
of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns 
for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself 
Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary 
speaking tour. Truth saw her journey 
as a mission from God. Her faith often led her 
to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences 
as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded 
to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set 
fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling 
herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out 
and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, 
my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer,
until they had no desire to harm her. Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of
people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond
public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved
with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing 
supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that 
she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue 
that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government. Truth continued to travel 
and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883, 
she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard 
in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even
in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful 
and will prevail."

the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of 
indentured servitude until their mid-20s. Throughout this period, 
enslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented 
from pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man 
named Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep 
her new family together— but the slow progress of abolition 
threatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, 
had promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, 
Baumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able 
to rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children 
remained in bondage. It would be two years before 
she regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait 
another two years before she saw any of her other children. During this time, 
Baumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated 
to religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community 
that shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking 
aloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers
took on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice 
of God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known 
as an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on 
Biblical references, spiritual ideals, 
and her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression 
of African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns 
for both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself 
Sojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary 
speaking tour. Truth saw her journey 
as a mission from God. Her faith often led her 
to the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences 
as the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded 
to her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set 
fire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling 
herself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out 
and quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, 
my body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer,
until they had no desire to harm her. Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of
people in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond
public speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved
with the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing 
supplies for Black troops. Her work was so well regarded that 
she was invited to meet President Lincoln. She took the occasion to argue 
that all formerly enslaved people should be granted land by the government. Truth continued to travel 
and speak well into her 80s. Until her death in 1883, 
she remained an outspoken critic who fought for her right to be heard 
in a hostile world. As Truth once said, “I feel safe even
in the midst of my enemies; for the truth is powerful 
and will prevail."

**Transcript**:
In early 1828, Sojourner Truth approached
the Grand Jury of Kingston, New York. She had no experience 
with the legal system, no money, and no power 
in the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for
custody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold 
to an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out 
over the next several months, Truth raised funds, 
strategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, 
Peter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate 
the rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding. Truth was born into slavery 
as Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century
in Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced 
the abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the

to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the moral Arc of the universe is long but it bends toward Justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a visions of humanity compassion and justce Justice and more than anything for those of you who share that I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on thank you very much Brian um so you heard and saw an obvious Desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue other than writing a check what what could we do well there are opportunities all around us if you live in the state of California for example there is a referendum coming up this uh spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment for example here in California we spend we're going to spend $1 billion on the death penalty in the next 5 years $1 billion uh and yet 46% of all homicide cases don't result in arrests uh 56% of all rape cases don't result so there's an opportunity to change that and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to uh law enforcement and and and safety and I think that opportunity exists all around us now there's been this huge decline in crime in in America over the last three decades and part of The Narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that well actually the violent crime rate has has remained relatively stable you know the the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided War on Drugs that's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population a and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low-level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back back to the people who they victimized I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one and I think that's the orientation that we have to change Brian you've you've struck a massive cord here you're an inspiring person thank you so much for coming to T thank you [Music] than

**Transcript**:
As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica, children flock to Mr. Kwaku for a story. They all know he’s full of tales 
from Ghana, the land of their ancestors. But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks, is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place. Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,
the all-seeing Sky God. People on Earth were bored 
and knew nothing about their history. But one creature decided
enough was enough. Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider, resolved to bring the stories
down to Earth. He spun a web that stretched 
into the clouds and climbed up to confront the Sky God. Crouching at Nyame’s feet,
Anansi shouted at the top of his lungs that he had come to take ownership 
of the world’s stories. Looking down from his golden stool, Nyame hooted with laughter 
at the spider’s absurd request. Nyame told Anansi that he could have
all the stories he wished— but only if he could complete
an impossible task. If Anansi brought him 
Osebo the Leopard, Onini the Python, Mmoboro the Hornet, 
and Mmoatia the Forest Spirit, then he could take the stories. Anansi humbly accepted. Nyame didn’t see him grinning 
as he scuttled away. Back on Earth, Anansi grabbed 
his magic bag and set to work. Anansi found Onini the Python
bathing in the sun. Anansi scoffed that Onini 
couldn’t be the longest animal, saying he looked no longer 
than a piece of bamboo cane. Enraged, Onini stretched himself across
the bamboo to prove his lengthiness. Anansi quickly bound him tight-tight 
to each end and placed him in his bag. Next, Anansi dug a great pit 
in the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,
and covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,
but offered to rescue him. As he helped Osebo out of the pit,
Anansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife. Osebo fell back to the ground where Anansi wound him up
tight-tight in spider thread. Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro 
and his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings 
could make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water 
and spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets
to shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:
to capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,
but Anansi knew she was lonely. So, he made a little doll covered in sap
and left it in her path. When she came upon it, 
Mmoatia spoke to the doll but became enraged when it didn’t answer. She hit the disrespectful doll and her small fists stuck 
to its sticky surface. Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tight-tight 
and scooped her into his bag along with the other creatures. Triumphantly, he climbed his web
back into the clouds. When the Sky God saw that Anansi 
had completed the impossible task, he was amazed. Nyame told Anansi 
that he had earned the world’s stories. Dancing for joy, Anansi gathered them up,
stuffed the stories into his bag, and descended to Earth. There, he scattered the stories 
throughout the world for people to share. And they did, Kwaku tells the children. Generations have continued
telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa
and enslaved. Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s
better than strong,” Kwaku says, and tells the children to take Anansi’s 
stories with them wherever they go. Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows
that Anansi will persist as a symbol of resourcefulness 
and resistance in the face of oppression, and a testament to the enduring power
of storytelling.

in the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,
and covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,
but offered to rescue him. As he helped Osebo out of the pit,
Anansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife. Osebo fell back to the ground where Anansi wound him up
tight-tight in spider thread. Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro 
and his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings 
could make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water 
and spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets
to shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:
to capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,
but Anansi knew she was lonely. So, he made a little doll covered in sap
and left it in her path. When she came upon it, 
Mmoatia spoke to the doll but became enraged when it didn’t answer. She hit the disrespectful doll and her small fists stuck 
to its sticky surface. Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tight-tight 
and scooped her into his bag along with the other creatures. Triumphantly, he climbed his web
back into the clouds. When the Sky God saw that Anansi 
had completed the impossible task, he was amazed. Nyame told Anansi 
that he had earned the world’s stories. Dancing for joy, Anansi gathered them up,
stuffed the stories into his bag, and descended to Earth. There, he scattered the stories 
throughout the world for people to share. And they did, Kwaku tells the children. Generations have continued
telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa
and enslaved. Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s
better than strong,” Kwaku says, and tells the children to take Anansi’s 
stories with them wherever they go. Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows
that Anansi will persist as a symbol of resourcefulness 
and resistance in the face of oppression, and a testament to the enduring power
of storytelling.

**Transcript**:
As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica, children flock to Mr. Kwaku for a story. They all know he’s full of tales 
from Ghana, the land of their ancestors. But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks, is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place. Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,
the all-seeing Sky God. People on Earth were bored 
and knew nothing about their history. But one creature decided
enough was enough. Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider, resolved to bring the stories
down to Earth. He spun a web that stretched 
into the clouds and climbed up to confront the Sky God. Crouching at Nyame’s feet,
Anansi shouted at the top of his lungs that he had come to take ownership 
of the world’s stories. Looking down from his golden stool, Nyame hooted with laughter 
at the spider’s absurd request. Nyame told Anansi that he could have
all the stories he wished— but only if he could complete
an impossible task. If Anansi brought him 
Osebo the Leopard, Onini the Python, Mmoboro the Hornet, 
and Mmoatia the Forest Spirit, then he could take the stories. Anansi humbly accepted. Nyame didn’t see him grinning 
as he scuttled away. Back on Earth, Anansi grabbed 
his magic bag and set to work. Anansi found Onini the Python
bathing in the sun. Anansi scoffed that Onini 
couldn’t be the longest animal, saying he looked no longer 
than a piece of bamboo cane. Enraged, Onini stretched himself across
the bamboo to prove his lengthiness. Anansi quickly bound him tight-tight 
to each end and placed him in his bag. Next, Anansi dug a great pit 
in the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,
and covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,

**Transcript**:
Translator: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years. Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy. The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready? Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind, that is "to follow." As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. Three trees together, we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire? Two fires together, I get really hot. Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning. For us, the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together, prosperous. Three together, that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door, it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home? This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. On the left, we have a woman. Two women together, they have an argument. (Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. So we have gone through almost 30 characters. By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old. So after we know the characters, we start building phrases. For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun, origin together, we build Japan. A person behind Japan, what do we get? A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. (Applause)

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The first eight radicals will allow you to build how many characters?
Options: A. 16, B. 32, C. 64
Correct Option: B

**Transcript**:
Here we have an athlete
preparing for a game. They’ve put on their gear
and done their warmup, and now it’s time for one
more routine— stretching. Typically, athletes stretch before
physical activity to avoid injuries like muscle strains and tears. But does stretching actually prevent
these issues? And if so, how long do the benefits
of stretching last? To answer these questions, we need to know what's actually happening
in the body when we stretch. There are two kinds of stretching
our athlete might be doing. Dynamic stretches,
which are controlled movements that engage a range of muscles
throughout the motion. And static stretches, 
where the stretcher holds a position to keep specific muscles
at a fixed length and tension. Our athlete is currently doing
a static hamstring stretch— a 30 second interval 
where he pulls his hamstring beyond its usual range of motion. However, while we often think 
of stretching a muscle like stretching a rubber band, muscles are actually comprised
of various tissue types, which interact to make a complex material. Rubber is elastic, meaning 
it resists being stretched and then returns to its original shape. But muscle is viscoelastic. This means that, in addition
to those elastic qualities, muscle changes under the stress
of being stretched. Let’s see this in action. At the large scale, this hamstring stretch
is pulling on layers of protective tissue surrounding the muscle fibers, as well as the tendons that connect
this muscle to nearby bones. These tissues contain elastic proteins
like collagen and elastin, which allow them to slightly elongate
over the duration of the stretch. At the smaller scale, these skeletal
muscle fibers are comprised of millions of sarcomeres— the smallest contracting unit
of muscle tissue. Sarcomere’s long, fibrous proteins can
relax to elongate muscle fibers or they can contract to shorten them— pulling on tendons and protective tissue to create the force
propelling our athlete’s body. And when those tissues have
been stretched out, they retain their strength
at longer lengths, allowing our athlete to take full
advantage of his improved range of motion. Unlike a rubber band, this muscle’s
resistance to stretching decreases with each 30 second stretch, allowing our athlete
to continually elongate his hamstring. And this improved flexibility
likely decreases the chance of incurring certain muscle injuries. But due to muscle’s elastic properties, this effect will be gone in just 
10 minutes without further activity. The exercise from his match should
elevate his muscle’s temperature and continue elongating the muscle, maintaining his increased flexibility
throughout the game. But once he gives his hamstrings a break, they’ll retract back 
to their previous state. So if all this is just temporary, how can you permanently improve 
your flexibility? For skeletal muscles, improved flexibility
comes from additional sarcomeres, which allow you to maintain strength
at even greater lengths. Sarcomeres are added and subtracted
to muscles depending on how frequently they’re used, so improving overall flexibility requires
a comprehensive stretching regimen. Plus, you need to stretch often—
very often. Current research suggests at least 
10 minutes a day for roughly two months. And since it's unsafe to hold
any stretch for too long, it's recommended that you break up your
stretching within any given session. Frequent stretching also makes lasting
changes to your brain. The more you stretch a muscle,
the higher your pain threshold becomes, allowing you to stretch
further and further. Long-term improvements 
to your flexibility can provide a better range of motion for your joints, potentially reducing your risk of muscle
injury in the short and long-term. But it’s also possible
to stretch too much, as flexible people can move their joints
in potentially dangerous ways. Stretching also isn't helpful
for every kind of movement, especially those where muscle
injuries aren't very common. For example, long distance running only
involves a small range of motion for the joints involved, so stretching is unlikely to prevent
that sport’s most common injuries. When it comes down to it, different lifestyles require 
different kinds of mobility. And no single stretching regimen is
flexible enough to fit every situation.

operates on exactly the same principle. In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it. Aesthetically speaking,
there's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks
to create their music: notes. And although the end result
can sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes
is actually pretty straightforward. Let's take a look at the foundational
elements to music notation and how they interact
to create a work of art. Music is written on five parallel lines
that go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note
or what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it. Let's start with pitch. To help us out,
we're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much
any instrument you can think of. In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on. But how do these pitches get their names? Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound
pretty similar compared to, say, a B. Going back to the staff, every line and every space
between two lines represents a separate pitch. If we put a note on one of these lines
or one of these spaces, we're telling a performer
to play that pitch. The higher up on the staff
a note is placed, the higher the pitch. But there are obviously
many, many more pitches than the nine that these
lines and spaces gives us. A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. So how do we condense
88 notes onto a single staff? We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure
placed at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular
line or space corresponds to a specific note
on your instrument. If we want to play notes
that aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw
extra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them. If we have to draw so many ledger lines
that it gets confusing, then we need to change
to a different clef. As for telling a performer
when to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this. (Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily. It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really. The point is that just
like the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long
as every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time
that are all the same length: beats. With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music
really starts to happen. This is a quarter note. It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat. This is a half note,
and it's worth two beats. This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each. "Great," you say, "what does that mean?" You might have noticed
that across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it
into small sections. These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar. At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer
how many beats are in each bar. This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on. The bottom number tells
us what kind of note is to be used as the basic
unit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on. So this time signature here tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on. But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes
with different rhythms. Notice that even though
the number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats
in each bar hasn't. So, what does our musical
creation sound like? (Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe
a bit thin, right? Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm. Now it's sounding like music. Sure, it takes some practice
to get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber.

**Transcript**:
When we watch a film or a play, we know that the actors probably learned
their lines from a script, which essentially tells them
what to say and when to say it. A piece of written music
operates on exactly the same principle. In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it. Aesthetically speaking,
there's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks
to create their music: notes. And although the end result
can sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes
is actually pretty straightforward. Let's take a look at the foundational
elements to music notation and how they interact
to create a work of art. Music is written on five parallel lines
that go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note
or what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it. Let's start with pitch. To help us out,
we're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much
any instrument you can think of. In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on. But how do these pitches get their names? Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound
pretty similar compared to, say, a B. Going back to the staff, every line and every space
between two lines represents a separate pitch. If we put a note on one of these lines
or one of these spaces, we're telling a performer
to play that pitch. The higher up on the staff
a note is placed, the higher the pitch. But there are obviously
many, many more pitches than the nine that these
lines and spaces gives us. A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. So how do we condense
88 notes onto a single staff? We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure
placed at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular
line or space corresponds to a specific note
on your instrument. If we want to play notes
that aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw
extra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them. If we have to draw so many ledger lines
that it gets confusing, then we need to change
to a different clef. As for telling a performer
when to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this. (Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily. It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really. The point is that just
like the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long
as every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time
that are all the same length: beats. With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music
really starts to happen. This is a quarter note. It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat. This is a half note,
and it's worth two beats. This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each. "Great," you say, "what does that mean?" You might have noticed
that across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it
into small sections. These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar. At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer
how many beats are in each bar. This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on. The bottom number tells
us what kind of note is to be used as the basic
unit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on. So this time signature here tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on. But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes
with different rhythms. Notice that even though
the number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats
in each bar hasn't. So, what does our musical
creation sound like? (Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe
a bit thin, right? Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm. Now it's sounding like music. Sure, it takes some practice
to get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber.

**Transcript**:
Conventional wisdom about diets, including government 
health recommendations, seems to change all the time. And yet, ads routinely come about claiming to have the answer 
about what we should eat. So how do we distinguish 
what's actually healthy from what advertisers just want us
to believe is good for us? Marketing takes advantage of
the desire to drop weight fast, and be stronger, slimmer, and brighter. And in the big picture, diet plans
promising dramatic results, known as fad diets, are just what they seem:
too good to be true. So where do diet fads even come from? While the Ancient Greeks and Romans rallied behind large-scale 
health regimens centuries earlier, this phenomenon began in earnest
in the Victorian Era with crazes like the vinegar diet and the Banting Diet. Since then, diets have advised us 
all sorts of things: to excessively chew, to not chew at all, to swallow a grapefruit per meal, non-stop cabbage soup, even consumption of arsenic, or tapeworms. If the idea of diet crazes 
has withstood history, could this mean that they work? In the short term, 
the answer is often yes. Low-carbohydrate plans, like the popular Atkins 
or South Beach Diets, have an initial diuretic effect. Sodium is lost until the body
can balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,
you might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping 
your overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers 
its metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal
if the diet is abandoned. So while these diets 
may be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits
for your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,
can help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial 
in maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary
weight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting
back calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you
to only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds
in the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,
and other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient 
and remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism
for consumers. While so-called superfoods,
like blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities
are largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions 
to a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed
as part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties
outweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist 
with jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh
fruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have
either a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than
the natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions 
to how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best
left to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our 
individual circumstances. Diets and food fads 
aren't inherently wrong. Circumstantially, 
they might even be right, just not for everyone all of the time.

and other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient 
and remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism
for consumers. While so-called superfoods,
like blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities
are largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions 
to a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed
as part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties
outweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist 
with jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh
fruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have
either a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than
the natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions 
to how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best
left to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our 
individual circumstances. Diets and food fads 
aren't inherently wrong. Circumstantially, 
they might even be right, just not for everyone all of the time.

**Transcript**:
Conventional wisdom about diets, including government 
health recommendations, seems to change all the time. And yet, ads routinely come about claiming to have the answer 
about what we should eat. So how do we distinguish 
what's actually healthy from what advertisers just want us
to believe is good for us? Marketing takes advantage of
the desire to drop weight fast, and be stronger, slimmer, and brighter. And in the big picture, diet plans
promising dramatic results, known as fad diets, are just what they seem:
too good to be true. So where do diet fads even come from? While the Ancient Greeks and Romans rallied behind large-scale 
health regimens centuries earlier, this phenomenon began in earnest
in the Victorian Era with crazes like the vinegar diet and the Banting Diet. Since then, diets have advised us 
all sorts of things: to excessively chew, to not chew at all, to swallow a grapefruit per meal, non-stop cabbage soup, even consumption of arsenic, or tapeworms. If the idea of diet crazes 
has withstood history, could this mean that they work? In the short term, 
the answer is often yes. Low-carbohydrate plans, like the popular Atkins 
or South Beach Diets, have an initial diuretic effect. Sodium is lost until the body
can balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,
you might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping 
your overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers 
its metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal
if the diet is abandoned. So while these diets 
may be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits
for your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,
can help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial 
in maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary
weight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting
back calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you
to only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds
in the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,
and other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient 
and remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism
for consumers. While so-called superfoods,
like blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities
