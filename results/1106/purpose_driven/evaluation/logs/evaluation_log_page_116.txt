**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What are the three core strategies for turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power?**

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the primary focus of the speaker in discussing the limitations of protest, and the correct option highlights the need for additional actions beyond protests to achieve lasting political impact. Question 3, on the other hand, asks about the three core strategies for turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power, which is closely related to the speaker's focus on the limitations of protest.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more similar in terms of intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 5: What is the purpose of choosing a defining fight?** is not the most similar, but **Question 3** is not the most similar either.

The most similar question is actually not present, but if I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but **Question 3** has some similarities.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **None of the above, but if I really had to choose: 3**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What was the outcome of the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East?**

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same topic and has a similar intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about what protest alone cannot achieve, and one of the options (B) mentions "Effectively selecting new democratic leaders." The Arab Spring protests, as mentioned in the transcript, were able to topple dictators, but the vacuum was often filled by militant and violent groups, implying that protest alone was not sufficient to establish new democratic leaders.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 2, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **2**

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, the options provided in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the first strategy for turning awareness into action and protest into political power.

Among the provided options, Question 3 is the closest match, but it asks about all three core strategies, not just the first one. If we were to modify the generated MCQs to better match the ground truth MCQ, a new question that specifically asks about the first strategy would be the most suitable match.

Given the current options, I would recommend Question 3 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ is about who can be part of expanding the frame of the possible, picking a defining fight, or securing an early win, and the correct answer is "Anyone willing to participate and live like a citizen."

However, if I had to choose the closest match from the generated MCQs, I would say Question 10 is the closest in terms of overall intent, as it talks about who can create change. But the options and content do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

So, I would say that there is no direct match, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 10 is the closest.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

**Question 2: Which of the following is an example of self-assembly in biology? Options: A. The formation of rocks, B. The folding of proteins into 3D structures, C. The assembly of a car engine, D. The growth of a crystal**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only mentions one example of self-assembly in biology (protein folding), whereas the ground truth MCQ mentions multiple examples (cell division, DNA and RNA, protein folding).

A more suitable match would be a question that includes all these examples. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest match, I would suggest:

**Question 2**

But I would recommend rephrasing the question to include all the examples mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, such as:

**Question: Where do we see self-assembly in biology? Options: A. Cell division, B. DNA and RNA, C. Protein folding, D. All of the above**

Since this is not an option, I will provide the index of the closest match:

**Index: 2**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely align with the ground truth MCQ.

You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is a potential application of self-assembly in the field of engineering? Options: A. The design of more efficient fossil fuel-based systems., B. The development of new materials that can repair themselves., C. The creation of more complex systems that require manual assembly., D.

However, an even more similar question is Question 9: What is a potential future application of self-assembly in the field of construction? Options: A. The development of new materials that can repair themselves., B. The creation of buildings that can adapt on their own to environmental or dynamic loading., C. The improvement of existing construction techniques., D. All of the above.

But the most similar question is actually Question 8 and Question 6's option B and Question 9  is not an exact match, the best match is actually Question 6's option B and more specifically Question 8's general idea of  "What is a potential application of self-assembly" 

However the best match is actually Question 9's option B  "The creation of buildings that can adapt on their own to environmental or dynamic loading" is not the correct match 

 Space structures is more closely related to construction and  "The creation of buildings" than to   "The development of new materials" or "The improvement of existing construction techniques"

However the original transcript contains the following sentence "Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans."

The correct answer would be an MCQ that contains an option that is an exact or a very close match to the option D of the ground truth MCQ, Namely "space structures can self assemble without humans"

Since none of the provided MCQs is an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the MCQ that has the closest match in terms of the content and the options 

The correct answer is actually Question 9, since it contains an option that is related to construction, however the correct answer is more specifically related to "space structures" 

I will provide the index of the MCQ that has the closest match to the ground truth MCQ

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What happens when a team of cognitively homogeneous individuals come up with ideas? Options: A. They come up with a wide range of different ideas., B. They come up with the same ideas as each other., C. They come up with a mix of similar and different ideas., D. They are unable to come up with any ideas.

However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the number of useful ideas generated by a cognitively homogeneous team.

A closer match can be found in Question 10, if we consider the opposite scenario: What is the result of a team of 10 cognitively diverse individuals coming up with 10 useful ideas each? Options: A. A total of 10 useful ideas., B. A total of 50 useful ideas., C. A total of 100 useful ideas., D. A total of 1000 useful ideas.

Considering the opposite scenario, we can infer that the speaker would suggest that a cognitively homogeneous team would generate a total of 10 useful ideas (Option A).

However, since this is not a direct match, we can also consider another question that is more similar in content. 

A more similar question in content is Question 2. 

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQs are Question 2 and Question 10.

However, if I must choose one index, I will choose Question 10 as the most similar, considering the opposite scenario.

[Music] when it comes to tasks that we're more familiar with like problem solving and coming up with creative ideas and strategies or new products and businesses the power of cognitive diversity is even more profound and perhaps a good way to make the point conceptually is to imagine you're putting together a group of 10 people in the team to come up with creative ideas to do the next big thing in your business or organization and let's also assume that this is a talented group of people each of whom comes up with 10 genuinely useful ideas so 10 people in the team each of whom is coming up with 10 useful ideas how many useful ideas do you have in total this is a slightly trick question because you think one would think a hundred ten people ten ideas each but if they're cognitively homogeneous if they think in the same way and they come up with the same 10 ideas you only have 10 overall if on the other hand they are cognitively diverse and come up with different ideas from one another you could have a hundred useful ideas in the space of innovation which is going to dominate the future of our economy our political institutions and more engineering cognitive diversity relative to the context you get this massive uplift in what i call collective intelligence and the tragedy is two things one a psychological point we are attracted unconsciously to people who think like us when people are mirroring our perspective back to us it makes us feel smarter it validates our world view the pleasure centers of our brains light up in brain scanners when people are telling us things we already suspect or believe all confirm our prejudices and can you see the problem when it's a simple task that's fine any one person has a solution you surround yourself with like-minded others you are able to deliver the solution but as the complexity increases and no one brain is sufficient to solve the problem when you're attracted to people who think in the same way you're getting no uplift at all in collective intelligence and by mirroring each other's perspectives you become more confident about a solution that might be gravely mistaken this is why cognitive diversity is so important and i believe will become the key feature of competitive advantage for the next 50 years but here's another thing it's not just a psychological problem it's a conceptual one whilst research in the book i talked to one of the most eminent economic forecasters in the world and he said if i truly believe that my model is the best one out there then by definition i should be working with people who think like me that logic is extremely compelling it is also spectacularly wrong wow [Music] you

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.
