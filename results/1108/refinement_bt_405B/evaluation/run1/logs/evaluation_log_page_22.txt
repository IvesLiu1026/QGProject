**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 1: What is the name of the queen of the Golden Horde mentioned in the transcript?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the Khanate in the Mongol Empire that Boraqchin is the queen of, while Question 1 asks about the name of the queen of the Golden Horde. Both questions are related to Boraqchin's role as a queen and her association with the Golden Horde.

However, if I had to choose a question that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ more closely, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match.

As dawn breaks over a moveable city

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that shares a similar intent and geographical context.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the river that guides Boraqchin's migration, while the generated MCQs do not mention a specific river. However, Question 2 mentions the reason for Queen Boraqchin's migration, which involves ensuring constant water and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. This question is related to the geographical context of the migration, but it does not specifically mention a river.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, as it is the only question that deals with the geographical context of the migration. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the river guiding the migration.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and content is not present in the provided options. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of oxen needed to pull Boraqchin's special wagon, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar in terms of intent, as it asks about a critical factor for Queen Boraqchin to consider when planning a move, which involves logistics and resource management, similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, the content and options are still quite different.

Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the number of oxen needed to pull Boraqchin's special wagon, with options that match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the class of medications approved for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, which asks about how ECT maintenance can be made more effective, even in patients who were resistant to medication before. Although the question content is not identical, both MCQs deal with the topic of treatment-resistant depression and the use of alternative or complementary treatments.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 8

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the specific question about the class of medications approved for treatment-resistant depression.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a diagnosis that is not effectively treated with ECT, with options including depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is somewhat related, as it discusses the effectiveness of ECT in treating patients who have not responded to other therapies. However, it does not specifically ask about a diagnosis that is not effectively treated with ECT.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the indications or contraindications of ECT, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would suggest Question 7, which discusses the effectiveness and potential side effects of ECT, but it's not a close match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or 7, but it's a weak match)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the ground truth MCQ specifically asks which option is NOT a potential side effect of ECT, and Question 4 asks about common side effects that patients may experience immediately after an ECT treatment session, both questions address the topic of side effects associated with ECT. The correct option in Question 4 (B. Achiness, fatigue, nausea, and mild memory loss) lists common side effects mentioned in the transcript, while the ground truth MCQ indicates that seizures (option D) are not a potential side effect in the context of modern ECT.

However, a more suitable match could be a generated MCQ that directly asks which option is NOT a potential side effect of ECT. Since no such question exists among the provided generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match based on the content and options related to ECT side effects.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 1 asks about the number of cells in the top row, not the total number of habitat cells, it's not a perfect match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 1 is the closest, but with a caveat that it's not asking the same thing.

But, if I really had to choose one, I would say:

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: How many cells are in the top row of the inverted pyramid habitat for the nano-rabbits?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the arrangement of the cells, and Question 1 mentions the "inverted pyramid habitat", which is the correct arrangement. However, Question 1 focuses on the number of cells in the top row, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the arrangement in general.

Unfortunately, there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 1, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of offspring produced by each pairing of rabbits. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, which asks about the primary method by which the nano-rabbits reproduce and where the newborn rabbits go. Although it does not directly ask about the number of offspring, it is related to the reproduction process of the rabbits.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question type and format, I would suggest Question 6, which asks about the number of trailing zeros in the product of 20 and 30. This question is similar in format to the ground truth MCQ, but it is not directly related to the number of offspring produced by each pairing of rabbits.

Since there is no generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is most similar in terms of question type and format:

Index: 6 (Note: This is not an exact match, but rather a suggestion based on the available generated MCQs)

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull

was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

**Transcript**:
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it takes for fallout to begin after a nuclear detonation. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 7 mentions a related time frame: "A person is in a poor shelter and needs urgent medical attention. What should they do? ... Seek outside help after an hour." 

However, a more relevant question is Question 6, which mentions the recommended duration for staying inside a shelter after a nuclear detonation and provides a time frame for the fallout in its explanation.

But the most relevant generated MCQ is actually not among the provided options, as none directly address the question of when fallout begins.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of time frames related to nuclear detonation, I would choose Question 7, but more accurately Question 6's explanation or another unlisted question would better match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] In April of 2014, under the control of an
Emergency Manager appointed by the state of Michigan to help the city
through an ongoing financial crisis, Flint, Michigan switched its water supply. For decades, the city’s water had been piped
in from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which got its water from Lake Huron and treated it. But in April of 2013, the decision was made
to build a pipeline and connect to a new system, the Karegnondi Water Authority. This would supply the city with lake water
that Flint would treat instead of Detroit, and was estimated to save 200 million dollars
over 25 years. In the meantime, as a sort of temporary fix
while the pipeline was being built, water would come in from the Flint River and be
treated at Flint's water treatment plant. Now, 4 years after that switch, we know that
it damaged hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure, caused deadly bacterial
outbreaks that killed at least 12 people, and exposed thousands of children to high
levels of lead in their drinking water. There are places to learn about the story
of how this happened, was covered up, and was eventually recognized, and the underlying situations that caused these massive mistakes to be made. So let's talk about the science of water. And how something as seemingly simple as a
switching to a different water source could lead to so many bad, but also seemingly unrelated,
outcomes. Humans have actually been using lead pipes
in water systems for hundreds of years, dating back to the ancient Romans. We eventually moved on to using other materials,
like iron. But in the late 1800s, engineers in the U.S.
were all about lead, because lead pipes were easier to bend around obstacles and were a
bit more durable than iron. People were suffering from lead poisoning,
but the public health risks weren’t seriously acknowledged until around the 1920s. And we gradually stopped making new water
pipes from lead. But in lots of cities in the U.S., like Flint,
Michigan, there are still several different kinds of metals in pipes for water. In Flint’s case, the pipes are made of lead
and iron. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn’t
have any sort of serious regulation about lead pipes until the Lead and Copper Rule
was enacted in 1991. It requires regular monitoring and action
plans if old lead pipes start becoming dangerous. So, all that to say, lead water pipes are
not that unusual, a 2016 study estimates that
there are still millions in use. And even though no amount of lead ingested
by a human is considered safe, maybe surprisingly, many of these
water systems are usually safe. A big part of the reason why is anti-corrosion
chemicals in the water, like orthophosphate. Orthophosphate helps lead and some other metal
pipes from corroding by forming a compound that makes a sort of protective layer on the
inside of the pipe. If that layer is patchy or missing, then electron-stealing
chemicals called oxidants, like dissolved oxygen gas, can react with the lead. And when that happens, the lead will dissolve
into the water and contaminate it. You’ve probably heard of that. It’s known as leaching, and it’s when
things get dangerous for people who need this water to drink or shower or do anything with
on their bodies. Flint, and it is unclear why besides possibly
cutting costs, did not add orthophosphate or any sort of anti-corrosion chemicals when
switching to Flint River water. Even though the treated water from Detroit
had had them. And because Flint was using iron and lead
pipes, both iron and lead ended up in the water. But that’s not the whole story. Not only were these pipes left unprotected,
but the water flowing through them also contained higher than average chloride levels. Research has found that chloride helps the
process of corrosion along. When there are enough chloride ions in the
water compared to some other ions, they start forming chemical complexes with lead and other
atoms. And these chloride complexes are soluble. So, basically, it’s another way that lead
can get into the water. Part of this too-much-chloride problem was
from the river water itself. Sodium chloride, which is just table salt,
would often wash into the river after being used as a de-icer on roads. But another part of it had to do with the
fact that, a couple of months after the switch to the Flint River water, there was also a
huge bacterial problem. The river water wasn’t just, like, extremely
dangerous, though. We know how to treat water. We put in disinfectants like chlorine, which can rip
open bacteria or mess with the molecules inside them. But it turns out that chlorine disinfectant
can react with metals from corroding pipes, especially iron, to become completely different compounds that do absolutely
nothing to control bacteria. So the disinfectants were made useless. Plus, more chloride ions ended up floating
around, which only made the corrosion process worse. And thus, the vicious cycle escalated. By August of 2014, there was a city warning
that E. coli and other typically gut-dwelling bacteria, collectively called fecal coliform
bacteria, were thriving in the water and could make people sick. The Flint treatment plant upped the amount
of chlorine they were using to try to kill off these contaminants. But because the pipes were already corroding,
it wasn’t working. Not only that, but all this extra chlorine
they were adding also reacted with some of the organic chemicals from the river water
to form disinfection byproducts called trihalomethanes. And, researchers have found trihalomethanes
to be linked to health problems and even cancer. So not only was the chlorine turning into
a bunch of non-disinfectant chemicals, one of those was potentially a carcinogen. Trihalomethanes in the water quickly swelled
to above the national regulatory limit. So to try and fix that problem, the treatment
plant added coagulants that would react with the organic matter in the water to help them
filter it out. Specifically, they used a chemical called
ferric chloride. Which took care of the trihalomethanes, but meant they were adding
even more chloride to the water. As the pipes got worse and more chlorine was
turned into useless compounds, the elevated bacterial levels became deadly. Between April 2014 and October 2015, at least
12 people died and 91 people got sick from an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, the
third largest recorded in U.S. history. Before the switch to the Flint River water,
there were only a handful of cases per year. Legionnaires’ disease is basically a really
intense pneumonia. It’s caused by breathing in water-borne
bacteria that infect the lungs so they get inflamed and lead to other symptoms. This outbreak was caused by a bacterium called
Legionella pneumophila, specifically the serogroup 6 strain, which isn’t usually detected in
the standard urine test for the disease. After some extensive studies, most researchers
agree that this chlorine inactivation at least played a part in letting these bacteria flourish. On top of that, some of the experts and investigative journalists think that there could have been more deaths than were officially confirmed, because of how tricky it can be
to diagnose Legionnaires’ disease. Some deaths caused by these bacterias could
have been attributed to pneumonia in general, and thus not counted. So, counterintuitive as it might seem, not
adding corrosion control also deactivated the chlorine disinfectant to basically undetectable
levels, resulting in tragic loss of life. In addition to all this, though, there was the ongoing
problem of metals leaching into the water supply. Which we definitely know was because of how
the Flint River water was treated. Because of all these chemical reactions, the
process by which lead and other metals got into the water was not slow and constant. Sometimes the pipes would leach metal slowly. But sometimes metal compounds, like the protective
layer that wasn’t being maintained, flaked off in little hunks, some of which were even
visible to the naked eye. The leached iron made the water look kind
of horrible and taste kind of rusty, but it isn’t a big health concern on its own. Lead is. But you can’t see, smell, or taste it in
water. A single tiny lead flake can take water from
safe, to far over the EPA’s limit of 15 parts per billion, which requires public action
to be taken. And besides randomly super contaminated samples
being right next to uncontaminated samples because of flakes, the protocols for testing
for lead can be manipulated to make it less likely to record how contaminated the water
actually is. Official EPA protocols for measuring drinking
water quality involves letting the water sit in pipes for at least 6 hours, and then collecting
it after a couple minutes. City protocols called for pre-flushing
the pipes for five minutes before letting them sit for 6 hours. And, according to experts, this pre-flushing
can sweep out initial bursts of lead particles so they’re not in the sample. Plus, people don’t just go turning on their
water every once in a while, so those samples aren’t necessarily reflective of what they’re
using and drinking. Even still, when the City of Flint tested
one resident’s water in February and March of 2015, they found lead levels at 104 ppb
and 397 ppb, far above the EPA’s action level. When researchers from Virginia Tech sampled
water from the same pipes at low, medium, and high flow rates, they found levels ranging
from 220 ppb to a whopping 13,200 ppb. And, to be totally clear about how intense
this is, a substance with more than 5,000 parts per billion of lead is considered hazardous
waste by the EPA. By September 2015, those same researchers
had collected and analyzed 252 water samples from various Flint homes. 101 of the samples had more than 5 ppb of
lead. And they estimated that 90% of homes had a
lead level below 25 ppb; 10% were above that. Which, and I can’t say this enough, was a lot of homes above that 15 parts per billion EPA limit for water. Protocols matter, y'all! So that's how metals ended up in the water. No corrosion control and high
corrosive chemical concentrations exposed many thousands
of people to lead poisoning. And lead poisoning can cause incredibly serious
health problems. Lead interferes with a lot of different enzymes,
can cause cells to die, and can slip past the protective blood-brain barrier to seriously
mess with the central nervous system. We don’t know exactly how it interacts with
all those systems, but lead ions are chemically pretty similar to calcium ions, which our
bodies use all the time in lots of chemical processes. So that may have something to do with it. In any case, it’s incredibly detrimental
to human bodies and brains, in adults and especially in children. All of this was made worse by the fact that
the city of Flint has a water system built to deliver water to over 200,000 people. Since the population peaked at around that in
the 1960s, it has declined to less than half that. So in some areas, the water moved through
some pipes slowly or sat stagnant. As the Flint River water sat in the pipes
and the corrosive chemistry did its thing, metal concentration rose, disinfectant concentration
decreased, and bacterial growth increased. The city of Flint switched back to piping
in treated water from the Detroit water system in October 2015, after 18 months. And they’re adding in extra phosphate chemicals
to try to build up that protective layer again. But that doesn't just fix the problem that
had escalated over that year and a half. The pipes have already corroded, as have plumbing
fixtures and water heaters of many residents. So while the gradual leaching is hopefully
going down, metal flakes may still be chipping off. Tests show that lead levels are down,
and that’s great news, but many residents have also, understandably, lost faith in the government agencies that are now
reporting that the water is safe. The city is now undergoing a massively expensive
process of replacing all of its lead pipes. A step that was taken to save money has ended
up costing far more money than it could have saved, not to mention lost health, and lost
lives. The way that science was ignored, unknown,
or even misused in this story is a lesson that we all have to live with, and one that
we at SciShow hope that we can learn from. Thanks to our patrons on Patreon who support

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 has some relevance to the topic of lead pipes. However, it does not specifically address the decade when the health risks of using lead pipes were recognized.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of lead pipes, I would say:

 Question 2

However, I would like to note that this is not a perfect match, and a new question that directly addresses the decade when the health risks of using lead pipes were recognized would be a better match.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new question that directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 8 does not directly ask about the subspecies that most modern house cats evolved from, I will look for other questions that might be related to the evolution or origin of domestic cats.

Question 6 discusses the genetic similarity between modern domestic cats and ancient wildcats, which is related to the evolution of domestic cats. However, it does not specifically ask about the subspecies.

Given the options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 6 is the closest, as it talks about the genetic makeup of modern domestic cats and their similarity to ancient wildcats.

and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: How did the Egyptians' relationship with cats differ from that of the Neolithic farmers?** is not the most similar, however, question 8 does discuss the migration of cats from one place to another.

**Question 9: What would likely happen if a domestic cat were introduced to a new environment, such as a ship or farm?** is also related to migration but does not discuss how cats migrated.

However, none of the questions directly discuss how ancient cats spread. But some questions do discuss the migration of cats.

But if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of the question (which is migration), I would choose:

**Question 8**

However, please note that this is not an exact match, as the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of how ancient cats spread.

It would be more accurate to say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm, and now you and your brother  are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you. And then you see the troll. It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net. You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go. The troll laughs. “If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer. If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures." You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something false,”
he continues, “then I’ll release your brother." Your statement can 
only be a single sentence. And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures." What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do. Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 2 are asking about the conditions under which the troll will release the creatures.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, they both involve the idea of saying something true or false to achieve a certain outcome.
- Content: Both questions are related to the rules set by the troll and how the narrator can use those rules to their advantage.

However, it's worth noting that Question 2 is not an exact match, as it asks about the condition for releasing all the creatures, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks specifically about what the troll will do if the narrator says something true.

If I had to choose the most similar question based on the provided options, I would choose Question 2, but I would recommend creating a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ. 

For example: 
Question: What will the troll do if the narrator says something true?
Options: A. Release the paradoxical creatures, B. Release the brother, C. Release both the creatures and the brother, D. Release no one

This new question would be a more direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording of the question is slightly different, the intent and content of the question are the same. The ground truth MCQ asks why the Norwegian team skied out in a grid-like shape when they got close to the South Pole, while Question 8 asks why Amundsen's team traversed the area around the South Pole in a grid. Both questions are asking about the same event and the reasons behind it.

The options for Question 8 are also similar to the options for the ground truth MCQ. Option B in Question 8 states that Amundsen's team traversed the area in a grid "to avoid the ambiguity surrounding Cook and Peary's North Pole claims", which is similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (Option D), which states that they wanted "to make sure they came close to the actual location of the Pole". Both options are referring to the same idea of ensuring the accuracy of their achievement.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the previous Antarctic experience of the two expedition leaders, while Question 4 asks about the main difference in the goals of Amundsen's and Scott's expeditions. Although the questions are not identical, Question 4 does mention the fact that Scott had a broader scientific research agenda and had been to the Antarctic before, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the previous Antarctic experience of the two expedition leaders.

Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible reason for this mismatch.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the colors of the connections between chrono-nodules, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript. However, none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3. However, please note that this is a weak match, as Question 3 asks about what happens when more nodules are activated, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the colors of the connections.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the randomness of the connection colors, such as:

Question: What determines the colors of the connections between chrono-nodules?
Options: A. The number of nodules activated, B. The type of nodules used, C. A predetermined pattern, D. Random chance

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this format.

Therefore, I will not provide an index for a matching generated MCQ, as none of them accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim, that we might end up 
making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is?

he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim, that we might end up 
making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is?

shirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up. You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations. You might get lucky within 
the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two 
good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you 
a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three 
possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for 
another three batteries. You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery. That would leave only two 
batteries untried. Since there are four good 
batteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result 
in 7 tries or less, no matter what order 
you test the piles in. With no time to spare, 
the iron comes to life, and you manage to get the shirt 
flawlessly ironed. The pleased elder and his family show up 
to the party dressed to the nines … well, almost.

However, this question does not directly ask for the number of possible combinations. A more similar question is not available, but Question 9 implies the correct number of combinations (28) in its correct option.

If we have to choose a question with a similar format, we can consider Question 4, which asks about the number of combinations in a smaller subset of batteries.

However, the question that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ's intent and format would be Question 9's implied correct option, but since that is not directly available, we can consider the closest match to be:

 Question 4 or Question 9 (with more emphasis on the implied correct option for Question 9).

However, if I must choose one index, I will choose Question 9 as the closest match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is about the water retention capacity of moss in the páramo, while the generated MCQs cover various environmental topics unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on a very broad interpretation of the topic (i.e., environmental topics related to water or ecosystems), I would say that Question 3 is the closest match. Question 3 is about the water cycle, which is a process that involves the movement of water in the environment, but it is still quite far from the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that this is a very weak match, and the generated MCQs do not adequately cover the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

None of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about a "water fund," which is a program where downstream businesses invest in protecting upstream water sources. None of the generated MCQs directly relate to this topic. However, Question 3 mentions the "water cycle," which is a process related to water. 

Although Question 3 is not a direct match, I will provide its index as it is the closest match among the generated MCQs:

Index: 3

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate match would require generated MCQs that directly relate to the concept of a "water fund."

**Transcript**:
[PBS BUMPER] There’s about 7.4 billion people on Earth
today ...and over 200 million dogs. So exactly where, when, and why did warm-hearted
wolves join our pack? And who trained who? [OPEN] So… Cat person? Or dog person? Me? I’m totally impartial. No matter where you sit – siiiiiiit, it’s
plain to see that the histories of dogs and humans are intertwined… maybe like no other
two species. If we take domestication out of the human
equation, it’s estimated just 1 or 2 million of us would be around today. And of all those animal alliances, our relationship
with dogs is the oldest. But figuring out why, where, and when domestic
dogs first originated is still a bone of contention. Why? Is the easiest to answer. Every continent is home to wild canids – like
Africa’s painted dogs or Asia’s doles, but thanks to genetic research we know modern
pups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their
DNA back to ancient wolves. You may have heard that wolves and ancient
people were hunting buddies that used teamwork to run down bigger prey. That’s a nice story, but wolf packs can
hunt just fine on their own – and usually aren’t too big on sharing. Plus, early humans tended to kill off most
carnivorous competition. It’s most likely that humans didn’t adopt
dogs. Dogs adopted us. Any “wolves gone mild” that were tolerant
of humans could have scrounged our scraps. They didn’t need us, but our leftovers could
have made their lives easier. Today, about 85 percent of domestic dogs still
survive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists
are still trying to figure out when and where that change occurred. Studying living wolves tells us the line that
led to our pups is extinct today, but we can still find their footprints in modern dog
genomes. Looking at DNA in mitochondria tells us dogs
split from their wolf ancestors somewhere in Europe between 19 and 32 thousand years
ago, but whole genomes from dozens of living dogs put the split somewhere in South Asia
around 33,000 years ago. It’s tough to pin down because dog genes
have mixed so much. Fossils don’t tell the whole story either,
because bones alone can’t tell us when the thing that looked like a wolf started to act
like a dog. But combining the two, fossils and DNA, could give us some hints. DNA extracted from ancient dog fossils has
suggested a new story: the domestication split happened in two places, at least 12,000 years
ago. And then at some point, Eastern dogs followed
people west, and became the dominant ancestor of our canine compadres. Dogs became useful herders, sled pullers,
and guards – against predators AND neighboring human tribes. And in a pinch, they could have served as
an emergency food supply. Dogs probably saved us more times than we
can count. We’re paying them back – pups now have
access to insurance, healthcare, some even have more instagram followers than you and
me. From a wolf mold, we’ve crafted 340 or so
dog breeds, even a few weird ones. It’s hard to believe every domestic dog
is still part of the same species, one whose story is so tightly wound to our own, that
we still can’t quite tell where it begins. Stay! Staaaay. Curious.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1: What is the estimated number of people on Earth today?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the number of dogs on Earth today.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly ask about the number of dogs on Earth today. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of population or numbers, I would choose:

**None of the provided options directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 1 is the closest in terms of topic (population numbers), but it's still not a good match.**

If I really had to choose an index, I would say: **1** (with the caveat that it's not a good match).

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly ask about the number of dogs on Earth today, to get a more accurate match.

survive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists
are still trying to figure out when and where that change occurred. Studying living wolves tells us the line that
led to our pups is extinct today, but we can still find their footprints in modern dog
genomes. Looking at DNA in mitochondria tells us dogs
split from their wolf ancestors somewhere in Europe between 19 and 32 thousand years
ago, but whole genomes from dozens of living dogs put the split somewhere in South Asia
around 33,000 years ago. It’s tough to pin down because dog genes
have mixed so much. Fossils don’t tell the whole story either,
because bones alone can’t tell us when the thing that looked like a wolf started to act
like a dog. But combining the two, fossils and DNA, could give us some hints. DNA extracted from ancient dog fossils has
suggested a new story: the domestication split happened in two places, at least 12,000 years
ago. And then at some point, Eastern dogs followed
people west, and became the dominant ancestor of our canine compadres. Dogs became useful herders, sled pullers,
and guards – against predators AND neighboring human tribes. And in a pinch, they could have served as
an emergency food supply. Dogs probably saved us more times than we
can count. We’re paying them back – pups now have
access to insurance, healthcare, some even have more instagram followers than you and
me. From a wolf mold, we’ve crafted 340 or so
dog breeds, even a few weird ones. It’s hard to believe every domestic dog
is still part of the same species, one whose story is so tightly wound to our own, that
we still can’t quite tell where it begins. Stay! Staaaay. Curious.

**Transcript**:
[PBS BUMPER] There’s about 7.4 billion people on Earth
today ...and over 200 million dogs. So exactly where, when, and why did warm-hearted
wolves join our pack? And who trained who? [OPEN] So… Cat person? Or dog person? Me? I’m totally impartial. No matter where you sit – siiiiiiit, it’s
plain to see that the histories of dogs and humans are intertwined… maybe like no other
two species. If we take domestication out of the human
equation, it’s estimated just 1 or 2 million of us would be around today. And of all those animal alliances, our relationship
with dogs is the oldest. But figuring out why, where, and when domestic
dogs first originated is still a bone of contention. Why? Is the easiest to answer. Every continent is home to wild canids – like
Africa’s painted dogs or Asia’s doles, but thanks to genetic research we know modern
pups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their
DNA back to ancient wolves. You may have heard that wolves and ancient
people were hunting buddies that used teamwork to run down bigger prey. That’s a nice story, but wolf packs can
hunt just fine on their own – and usually aren’t too big on sharing. Plus, early humans tended to kill off most
carnivorous competition. It’s most likely that humans didn’t adopt
dogs. Dogs adopted us. Any “wolves gone mild” that were tolerant
of humans could have scrounged our scraps. They didn’t need us, but our leftovers could
have made their lives easier. Today, about 85 percent of domestic dogs still
survive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since the ground truth MCQ is asking for a definition of a neutron star, and none of the generated MCQs directly ask for a definition, I will choose the one that provides the most relevant information about neutron stars.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

Reasoning: Although Question 2 does not directly ask for a definition of a neutron star, it provides information about the composition of a neutron star, specifically the "nuclear pasta" in its crust. This question is the closest in terms of content and intent to the ground truth MCQ, which asks for a definition of a neutron star.

Note: A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks for a definition of a neutron star, such as "What is a neutron star?" with options that include a dense compact object, a fundamental particle, etc. However, since such a question is not available among the generated MCQs, I chose the closest one based on content and intent.

whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth

**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have 
been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line – behind them winds 
the entire civilian city, which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children 
and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.

**Transcript**:
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening. A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home. This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

**Transcript**:
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure
during which patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under 
general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies, or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be, but patients can still 
experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session— for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication, even in patients who were
resistant to medication before. As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment, she worried that doing so
might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

to start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more 
down the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster.

**Transcript**:
After years of experiments, you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell directly below the 
two cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free 
and overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number for the count of rabbits

**Transcript**:
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth, and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures. But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits of getting inside. So while we’ll hopefully never need to, remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.

**Transcript**:
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two. This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away. There is tragically nothing 
that can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast are even better at 
guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated 
clothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward. Nuclear weapons are some of the most

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] In April of 2014, under the control of an
Emergency Manager appointed by the state of Michigan to help the city
through an ongoing financial crisis, Flint, Michigan switched its water supply. For decades, the city’s water had been piped
in from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which got its water from Lake Huron and treated it. But in April of 2013, the decision was made
to build a pipeline and connect to a new system, the Karegnondi Water Authority. This would supply the city with lake water
that Flint would treat instead of Detroit, and was estimated to save 200 million dollars
over 25 years. In the meantime, as a sort of temporary fix
while the pipeline was being built, water would come in from the Flint River and be
treated at Flint's water treatment plant. Now, 4 years after that switch, we know that
it damaged hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure, caused deadly bacterial
outbreaks that killed at least 12 people, and exposed thousands of children to high
levels of lead in their drinking water. There are places to learn about the story
of how this happened, was covered up, and was eventually recognized, and the underlying situations that caused these massive mistakes to be made. So let's talk about the science of water. And how something as seemingly simple as a
switching to a different water source could lead to so many bad, but also seemingly unrelated,
outcomes. Humans have actually been using lead pipes
in water systems for hundreds of years, dating back to the ancient Romans. We eventually moved on to using other materials,
like iron. But in the late 1800s, engineers in the U.S.
were all about lead, because lead pipes were easier to bend around obstacles and were a
bit more durable than iron. People were suffering from lead poisoning,
but the public health risks weren’t seriously acknowledged until around the 1920s. And we gradually stopped making new water
pipes from lead. But in lots of cities in the U.S., like Flint,
Michigan, there are still several different kinds of metals in pipes for water. In Flint’s case, the pipes are made of lead
and iron. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn’t
have any sort of serious regulation about lead pipes until the Lead and Copper Rule
was enacted in 1991. It requires regular monitoring and action
plans if old lead pipes start becoming dangerous. So, all that to say, lead water pipes are
not that unusual, a 2016 study estimates that
there are still millions in use. And even though no amount of lead ingested
by a human is considered safe, maybe surprisingly, many of these
water systems are usually safe. A big part of the reason why is anti-corrosion
chemicals in the water, like orthophosphate. Orthophosphate helps lead and some other metal
pipes from corroding by forming a compound that makes a sort of protective layer on the
inside of the pipe. If that layer is patchy or missing, then electron-stealing
chemicals called oxidants, like dissolved oxygen gas, can react with the lead. And when that happens, the lead will dissolve
into the water and contaminate it. You’ve probably heard of that. It’s known as leaching, and it’s when
things get dangerous for people who need this water to drink or shower or do anything with
on their bodies. Flint, and it is unclear why besides possibly
cutting costs, did not add orthophosphate or any sort of anti-corrosion chemicals when
switching to Flint River water. Even though the treated water from Detroit
had had them. And because Flint was using iron and lead
pipes, both iron and lead ended up in the water. But that’s not the whole story. Not only were these pipes left unprotected,
but the water flowing through them also contained higher than average chloride levels. Research has found that chloride helps the
process of corrosion along. When there are enough chloride ions in the
water compared to some other ions, they start forming chemical complexes with lead and other
atoms. And these chloride complexes are soluble. So, basically, it’s another way that lead
can get into the water. Part of this too-much-chloride problem was
from the river water itself. Sodium chloride, which is just table salt,
would often wash into the river after being used as a de-icer on roads. But another part of it had to do with the
fact that, a couple of months after the switch to the Flint River water, there was also a
huge bacterial problem. The river water wasn’t just, like, extremely
dangerous, though. We know how to treat water. We put in disinfectants like chlorine, which can rip
open bacteria or mess with the molecules inside them. But it turns out that chlorine disinfectant
can react with metals from corroding pipes, especially iron, to become completely different compounds that do absolutely
nothing to control bacteria. So the disinfectants were made useless. Plus, more chloride ions ended up floating
around, which only made the corrosion process worse. And thus, the vicious cycle escalated. By August of 2014, there was a city warning
that E. coli and other typically gut-dwelling bacteria, collectively called fecal coliform
bacteria, were thriving in the water and could make people sick. The Flint treatment plant upped the amount
of chlorine they were using to try to kill off these contaminants. But because the pipes were already corroding,
it wasn’t working. Not only that, but all this extra chlorine
they were adding also reacted with some of the organic chemicals from the river water
to form disinfection byproducts called trihalomethanes. And, researchers have found trihalomethanes
to be linked to health problems and even cancer. So not only was the chlorine turning into
a bunch of non-disinfectant chemicals, one of those was potentially a carcinogen. Trihalomethanes in the water quickly swelled
to above the national regulatory limit. So to try and fix that problem, the treatment
plant added coagulants that would react with the organic matter in the water to help them
filter it out. Specifically, they used a chemical called
ferric chloride. Which took care of the trihalomethanes, but meant they were adding
even more chloride to the water. As the pipes got worse and more chlorine was
turned into useless compounds, the elevated bacterial levels became deadly. Between April 2014 and October 2015, at least
12 people died and 91 people got sick from an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, the
third largest recorded in U.S. history. Before the switch to the Flint River water,
there were only a handful of cases per year. Legionnaires’ disease is basically a really
intense pneumonia. It’s caused by breathing in water-borne
bacteria that infect the lungs so they get inflamed and lead to other symptoms. This outbreak was caused by a bacterium called
Legionella pneumophila, specifically the serogroup 6 strain, which isn’t usually detected in
the standard urine test for the disease. After some extensive studies, most researchers
agree that this chlorine inactivation at least played a part in letting these bacteria flourish. On top of that, some of the experts and investigative journalists think that there could have been more deaths than were officially confirmed, because of how tricky it can be
to diagnose Legionnaires’ disease. Some deaths caused by these bacterias could
have been attributed to pneumonia in general, and thus not counted. So, counterintuitive as it might seem, not
adding corrosion control also deactivated the chlorine disinfectant to basically undetectable
levels, resulting in tragic loss of life. In addition to all this, though, there was the ongoing
problem of metals leaching into the water supply. Which we definitely know was because of how
the Flint River water was treated. Because of all these chemical reactions, the
process by which lead and other metals got into the water was not slow and constant. Sometimes the pipes would leach metal slowly. But sometimes metal compounds, like the protective
layer that wasn’t being maintained, flaked off in little hunks, some of which were even
visible to the naked eye. The leached iron made the water look kind
of horrible and taste kind of rusty, but it isn’t a big health concern on its own. Lead is. But you can’t see, smell, or taste it in
water. A single tiny lead flake can take water from
safe, to far over the EPA’s limit of 15 parts per billion, which requires public action
to be taken. And besides randomly super contaminated samples
being right next to uncontaminated samples because of flakes, the protocols for testing
for lead can be manipulated to make it less likely to record how contaminated the water
actually is. Official EPA protocols for measuring drinking
water quality involves letting the water sit in pipes for at least 6 hours, and then collecting
it after a couple minutes. City protocols called for pre-flushing
the pipes for five minutes before letting them sit for 6 hours. And, according to experts, this pre-flushing
can sweep out initial bursts of lead particles so they’re not in the sample. Plus, people don’t just go turning on their
water every once in a while, so those samples aren’t necessarily reflective of what they’re
using and drinking. Even still, when the City of Flint tested
one resident’s water in February and March of 2015, they found lead levels at 104 ppb
and 397 ppb, far above the EPA’s action level. When researchers from Virginia Tech sampled
water from the same pipes at low, medium, and high flow rates, they found levels ranging
from 220 ppb to a whopping 13,200 ppb. And, to be totally clear about how intense
this is, a substance with more than 5,000 parts per billion of lead is considered hazardous
waste by the EPA. By September 2015, those same researchers
had collected and analyzed 252 water samples from various Flint homes. 101 of the samples had more than 5 ppb of
lead. And they estimated that 90% of homes had a
lead level below 25 ppb; 10% were above that. Which, and I can’t say this enough, was a lot of homes above that 15 parts per billion EPA limit for water. Protocols matter, y'all! So that's how metals ended up in the water. No corrosion control and high
corrosive chemical concentrations exposed many thousands
of people to lead poisoning. And lead poisoning can cause incredibly serious
health problems. Lead interferes with a lot of different enzymes,
can cause cells to die, and can slip past the protective blood-brain barrier to seriously
mess with the central nervous system. We don’t know exactly how it interacts with
all those systems, but lead ions are chemically pretty similar to calcium ions, which our
bodies use all the time in lots of chemical processes. So that may have something to do with it. In any case, it’s incredibly detrimental
to human bodies and brains, in adults and especially in children. All of this was made worse by the fact that
the city of Flint has a water system built to deliver water to over 200,000 people. Since the population peaked at around that in
the 1960s, it has declined to less than half that. So in some areas, the water moved through
some pipes slowly or sat stagnant. As the Flint River water sat in the pipes
and the corrosive chemistry did its thing, metal concentration rose, disinfectant concentration
decreased, and bacterial growth increased. The city of Flint switched back to piping
in treated water from the Detroit water system in October 2015, after 18 months. And they’re adding in extra phosphate chemicals
to try to build up that protective layer again. But that doesn't just fix the problem that
had escalated over that year and a half. The pipes have already corroded, as have plumbing
fixtures and water heaters of many residents. So while the gradual leaching is hopefully
going down, metal flakes may still be chipping off. Tests show that lead levels are down,
and that’s great news, but many residents have also, understandably, lost faith in the government agencies that are now
reporting that the water is safe. The city is now undergoing a massively expensive
process of replacing all of its lead pipes. A step that was taken to save money has ended
up costing far more money than it could have saved, not to mention lost health, and lost
lives. The way that science was ignored, unknown,
or even misused in this story is a lesson that we all have to live with, and one that
we at SciShow hope that we can learn from. Thanks to our patrons on Patreon who support

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

**Transcript**:
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time, but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other. He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world and were determined to prove
it in a competition. The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them
more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers. And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.

**Transcript**:
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors, or cooperative companions 
of any kind. But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature
to their will, producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents, as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate
from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point --

**Transcript**:
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm, and now you and your brother  are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you. And then you see the troll. It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net. You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go. The troll laughs. “If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer. If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures." You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something false,”
he continues, “then I’ll release your brother." Your statement can 
only be a single sentence. And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures." What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do. Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words

to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm, and now you and your brother  are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you. And then you see the troll. It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net. You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go. The troll laughs. “If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer. If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures." You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something false,”
he continues, “then I’ll release your brother." Your statement can 
only be a single sentence. And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures." What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do. Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option 
is for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll 
has to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.

**Transcript**:
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest. Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake– birds, after all, 
have better color vision. One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm when those other species 
have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos 
with much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely 
to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times
from different locations, and they had very different 
plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs, as well as specially
designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition, he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic 
research stations. But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.

**Transcript**:
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the
opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped, with only two key locations
remaining: the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims
to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

**Transcript**:
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close, and your only way back will be 
to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose
or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect
to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections
between them were red. But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal. You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time.

**Transcript**:
a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

a group of youths sneak into the woods, where they take mind-altering substances, switch it up romantically, and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension. "A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic – and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page. First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time, taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena 
definitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best – when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up

and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop
some genuine hope. They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around
a shared purpose. These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is." We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re

**Transcript**:
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience
events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be
the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune
in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned
straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change 
the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace

the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two 
good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you 
a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three 
possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for 
another three batteries. You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery. That would leave only two 
batteries untried. Since there are four good 
batteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result

**Transcript**:
[PBS BUMPER] There’s about 7.4 billion people on Earth
today ...and over 200 million dogs. So exactly where, when, and why did warm-hearted
wolves join our pack? And who trained who? [OPEN] So… Cat person? Or dog person? Me? I’m totally impartial. No matter where you sit – siiiiiiit, it’s
plain to see that the histories of dogs and humans are intertwined… maybe like no other
two species. If we take domestication out of the human
equation, it’s estimated just 1 or 2 million of us would be around today. And of all those animal alliances, our relationship
with dogs is the oldest. But figuring out why, where, and when domestic
dogs first originated is still a bone of contention. Why? Is the easiest to answer. Every continent is home to wild canids – like
Africa’s painted dogs or Asia’s doles, but thanks to genetic research we know modern
pups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their
DNA back to ancient wolves. You may have heard that wolves and ancient
people were hunting buddies that used teamwork to run down bigger prey. That’s a nice story, but wolf packs can
hunt just fine on their own – and usually aren’t too big on sharing. Plus, early humans tended to kill off most
carnivorous competition. It’s most likely that humans didn’t adopt
dogs. Dogs adopted us. Any “wolves gone mild” that were tolerant
of humans could have scrounged our scraps. They didn’t need us, but our leftovers could
have made their lives easier. Today, about 85 percent of domestic dogs still
survive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists
are still trying to figure out when and where that change occurred. Studying living wolves tells us the line that
led to our pups is extinct today, but we can still find their footprints in modern dog
genomes. Looking at DNA in mitochondria tells us dogs
split from their wolf ancestors somewhere in Europe between 19 and 32 thousand years
ago, but whole genomes from dozens of living dogs put the split somewhere in South Asia
around 33,000 years ago. It’s tough to pin down because dog genes
have mixed so much. Fossils don’t tell the whole story either,
because bones alone can’t tell us when the thing that looked like a wolf started to act
like a dog. But combining the two, fossils and DNA, could give us some hints. DNA extracted from ancient dog fossils has
suggested a new story: the domestication split happened in two places, at least 12,000 years
ago. And then at some point, Eastern dogs followed
people west, and became the dominant ancestor of our canine compadres. Dogs became useful herders, sled pullers,
and guards – against predators AND neighboring human tribes. And in a pinch, they could have served as
an emergency food supply. Dogs probably saved us more times than we
can count. We’re paying them back – pups now have
access to insurance, healthcare, some even have more instagram followers than you and
me. From a wolf mold, we’ve crafted 340 or so
dog breeds, even a few weird ones. It’s hard to believe every domestic dog
is still part of the same species, one whose story is so tightly wound to our own, that
we still can’t quite tell where it begins. Stay! Staaaay. Curious.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its 
innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects 
in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.

fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion, gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact. That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity, bolster important theories 
in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.
