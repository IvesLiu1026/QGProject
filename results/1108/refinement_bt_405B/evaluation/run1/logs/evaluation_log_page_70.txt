[Music] [Music] thank you so much it's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart I'm here to tell you a few Tales of passion there's a Jewish saying that I love what is truer than truth answer the story I'm a Storyteller I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common Humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until I end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues Freedom I'm aware of the mystery around us so I write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years I have published a few books but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in Macy and my grandchildren don't think that I'm cool allow me to tell you about my 4 Minutes of Fame one of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker I was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag five women representing five continents and three Olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was I going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anarak looking like the Micheline Man by the middle of February I found my myself in touring where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserve to win but there's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics passion lives here isn't it always true heart is what drives us and determines Our Fate that is what I need for my characters in my books a passionate heart I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers Outsiders and Rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in The Green Room of the stadium I met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses Susan sandon and Sophia Lauren also two women with passionate Hearts when G maai the Noble Prize winner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather and in some in some places in Africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somal Mom a Cambodian activist who fights passionately Against Child prostitution when she was 14 years years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS and of brothels where children are forced to receive 55 clients per day and if they Rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room I received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear but it was far from the Michel in Man's suit that I had anticipated not bad really I look like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag bearers except Sophia Lauren the universal symbol of beauty and passion Sophia is over 70 and she looks great she's sexy slim and Tall with a deep tan now H how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles I don't know when asked in a TV interview how could she look so good she replied posture my back is always straight and I don't make old people's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she didn't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the AA March Sophia Lauren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than I am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the African Savannah holding the flag on her shoulder I joged behind on my tiptoes holding my the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on Sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo I appear too although often between Sophia's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic Stadium my husband is offended when I say this although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than 4 minutes so he shouldn't take it personally I have all the Press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tootsi refugees in Congo by the way 80% of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in Congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of these of this story are a young woman Rose Mendo and her children she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins to tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the Camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young American man Sasha sharnov she manages who manages to put her in a US rescue plane Rose maen and her nine children end up in Phoenix Arizona where they are now living and thriving mapendo in s Swahili means great love the protagonist of my books are strong and passionate women like rose Mendo I don't make them up there's no need for that I look around and I see them everywhere I have worked with women and for women all my life I know them well I was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist although the term had not reached Chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but I was happy to pay it because for every blow that I received I was able to deliver too once when my daughter paa was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that I should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forc labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no Freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called the feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and I have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term change it for God's sake call it afterite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name doesn't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year is 2005 Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her 3-week vacation she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a Hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten mullers Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth teeth she's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she's terrified she doesn't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine Jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called Clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes the husband Furious threatens to kill the American Jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do 2third of the world's labor they own less than 1% of the world's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they are paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families Prosper The Village prospers and eventually so does the whole country when G matai goes to a village in Kenya she talks to the women and explains that the land is Barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a woman's program $20 are given to men's programs women are 51% of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any War today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged in January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Boo's paintings at the UC Berkeley Library no Museum or Gallery in the United States except for the New York gallery that carries bto's work has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu grabe prison there are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous batoo style I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart what I fear most is power with impunity I fear abuse of power and the power to abuse in our specie the alpha males Define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them and in this case the trickle down effect which does not work in economics works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men men have someone they can abuse a woman or a child I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender income race and class I think that the time is right to make fundamental changes in our civilization but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men I'm talking about men with young minds of course old guys are hopeless we have to wait for them to die off yes I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts but given a choice I would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maai Somali M Jenny and Rose mapendo I want to make this world good not better but to make it good why not it is possible look around in this room all this knowledge energy talent and Technology let's get off our fannies roll up our sleeves and get to work passionately in creating an almost perfect world thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you thank you [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in Industries like manufacturing and energy they're using Predictive Analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save Millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM let's build a smarter planet

**Question 3: According to the speaker, what is the key to winning in the Olympics? Options: A. A combination of luck and talent, B. Rigorous training and preparation, C. Passion and a fearless heart, D. Mental toughness and focus Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match is not found in the generated MCQs, but Question 3 is related to the Olympics and the concept of "passion," which is also present in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **3**

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically target the content of the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them directly ask about the Olympic slogan. If I were to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**New Question: What was the slogan of the Olympics mentioned by the speaker? Options: A. Passion Is Alive, B. Passion, Heart, Soul, C. Passion Lives Here, D. Passion Changes Us Correct Option: C**

This new question directly matches the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, this question is not among the generated MCQs, so I couldn't provide an index for it.

answer the story I'm a Storyteller I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common Humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until I end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues Freedom I'm aware of the mystery around us so I write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years I have published a few books but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in Macy and my grandchildren don't think that I'm cool allow me to tell you about my 4 Minutes of Fame one of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker I was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag five women representing five continents and three Olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was I going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anarak looking like the Micheline Man by the middle of February I found my myself in touring where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserve to win but there's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics passion lives here isn't it always true heart is what drives us and determines Our Fate that is what I need for my characters in my books a passionate heart I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers Outsiders and Rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in The Green Room of the stadium I met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses Susan sandon and Sophia Lauren also two women with passionate Hearts when G maai the Noble Prize winner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather and in some in some places in Africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somal Mom a Cambodian activist who fights passionately Against Child prostitution when she was 14 years years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS and of brothels where children are forced to receive 55 clients per day and if they Rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room I received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear but it was far from the Michel in Man's suit that I had anticipated not bad really I look like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag bearers except Sophia Lauren the universal symbol of beauty and passion Sophia is over 70 and she looks great she's sexy slim and Tall with a deep tan now H how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles I don't know when asked in a TV interview how could she look so good she replied posture my back is always straight and I don't make old people's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she didn't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the AA March Sophia Lauren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than I am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the African Savannah holding the flag on her shoulder I joged behind on my tiptoes holding my the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on Sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo I appear too although often between Sophia's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic Stadium my husband is offended when I say this although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than 4 minutes so he shouldn't take it personally I have all the Press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tootsi refugees in Congo by the way 80% of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in Congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of these of this story are a young woman Rose Mendo and her children she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins to tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the Camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young American man Sasha sharnov she manages who manages to put her in a US rescue plane Rose maen and her nine children end up in Phoenix Arizona where they are now living and thriving mapendo in s Swahili means great love the protagonist of my books are strong and passionate women like rose Mendo I don't make them up there's no need for that I look around and I see them everywhere I have worked with women and for women all my life I know them well I was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist although the term had not reached Chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but I was happy to pay it because for every blow that I received I was able to deliver too once when my daughter paa was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that I should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forc labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no Freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called the feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and I have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term change it for God's sake call it afterite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name doesn't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year is 2005 Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her 3-week vacation she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a Hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten mullers Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth teeth she's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she's terrified she doesn't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine Jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called Clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes the husband Furious threatens to kill the American Jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do 2third of the world's labor they own less than 1% of the world's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they are paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families Prosper The Village prospers and eventually so does the whole country when G matai goes to a village in Kenya she talks to the women and explains that the land is Barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a woman's program $20 are given to men's programs women are 51% of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any War today most of the casualties are civilians

[Music] [Music] thank you so much it's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart I'm here to tell you a few Tales of passion there's a Jewish saying that I love what is truer than truth answer the story I'm a Storyteller I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common Humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until I end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues Freedom I'm aware of the mystery around us so I write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years I have published a few books but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in Macy and my grandchildren don't think that I'm cool allow me to tell you about my 4 Minutes of Fame one of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker I was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag five women representing five continents and three Olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was I going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anarak looking like the Micheline Man by the middle of February I found my myself in touring where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserve to win but there's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics passion lives here isn't it always true heart is what drives us and determines Our Fate that is what I need for my characters in my books a passionate heart I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers Outsiders and Rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in The Green Room of the stadium I met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses Susan sandon and Sophia Lauren also two women with passionate Hearts when G maai the Noble Prize winner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather and in some in some places in Africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somal Mom a Cambodian activist who fights passionately Against Child prostitution when she was 14 years years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS and of brothels where children are forced to receive 55 clients per day and if they Rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room I received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear but it was far from the Michel in Man's suit that I had anticipated not bad really I look like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag bearers except Sophia Lauren the universal symbol of beauty and passion Sophia is over 70 and she looks great she's sexy slim and Tall with a deep tan now H how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles I don't know when asked in a TV interview how could she look so good she replied posture my back is always straight and I don't make old people's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she didn't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the AA March Sophia Lauren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than I am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the African Savannah holding the flag on her shoulder I joged behind on my tiptoes holding my the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on Sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo I appear too although often between Sophia's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic Stadium my husband is offended when I say this although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than 4 minutes so he shouldn't take it personally I have all the Press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tootsi refugees in Congo by the way 80% of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in Congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of these of this story are a young woman Rose Mendo and her children she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins to tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the Camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young American man Sasha sharnov she manages who manages to put her in a US rescue plane Rose maen and her nine children end up in Phoenix Arizona where they are now living and thriving mapendo in s Swahili means great love the protagonist of my books are strong and passionate women like rose Mendo I don't make them up there's no need for that I look around and I see them everywhere I have worked with women and for women all my life I know them well I was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist although the term had not reached Chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but I was happy to pay it because for every blow that I received I was able to deliver too once when my daughter paa was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that I should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forc labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no Freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called the feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and I have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term change it for God's sake call it afterite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name doesn't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year is 2005 Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her 3-week vacation she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a Hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten mullers Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth teeth she's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she's terrified she doesn't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine Jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called Clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes the husband Furious threatens to kill the American Jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do 2third of the world's labor they own less than 1% of the world's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they are paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families Prosper The Village prospers and eventually so does the whole country when G matai goes to a village in Kenya she talks to the women and explains that the land is Barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a woman's program $20 are given to men's programs women are 51% of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any War today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged in January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Boo's paintings at the UC Berkeley Library no Museum or Gallery in the United States except for the New York gallery that carries bto's work has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu grabe prison there are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous batoo style I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart what I fear most is power with impunity I fear abuse of power and the power to abuse in our specie the alpha males Define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them and in this case the trickle down effect which does not work in economics works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men men have someone they can abuse a woman or a child I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender income race and class I think that the time is right to make fundamental changes in our civilization but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men I'm talking about men with young minds of course old guys are hopeless we have to wait for them to die off yes I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts but given a choice I would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maai Somali M Jenny and Rose mapendo I want to make this world good not better but to make it good why not it is possible look around in this room all this knowledge energy talent and Technology let's get off our fannies roll up our sleeves and get to work passionately in creating an almost perfect world thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you thank you [Applause] what does a machine know about itself can it know when it needs to be repaired and when it doesn't in Industries like manufacturing and energy they're using Predictive Analytics to detect signs of trouble helping some companies save Millions on maintenance because machines seek help before they're broken and don't when they're not that's what I'm working on I'm an IBM let's build a smarter planet

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs

this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none

this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This might seem like a far-away place in a far-away land. My house is right there in the middle. This was 1992 L.A. Riots. And I remember being 8 years old and looking out there and thinking to myself, "This is it, this is game over. I'm done." The military came in, the cops came in, and I thought they were going to save us, and for some reason they kept on pointing the guns at my people. So I grew up angry, I grew up mad. I struggled watching my parents pay rent at the end of the month. Sometimes they had to take food out of their mouths so that we, my two younger sisters and I, could eat. And the people that I saw taking care of their family and taking care of business were the gang members. So I considered that as a career path, not because they were the ones that, you know, had the girls, had the cars, it was because they were the ones who took care of their families. And I love my family enough to even to consider that as a possibility. But it wasn't always bad. If you haven't put two and two together, I'm a Dodgers fan. I like the Dodgers even more so because Dodgers Stadium sits in the middle of the Elysian Park, one of the biggest parks in L.A., and I remember going out on the weekends with my family and for la carne asada and sharing our cultura and them taking me on trails and showing me all this amazing stuff that they knew. I grew up, I went to Dorsey High School. You might not know Dorsey that much, but you might know Crenshaw High School. Crenshaw and Dorsey are rival high schools, but they are more than just rivals in the traditional sense of rival high schools, they are the birth place of The Bloods and The Crips. So I was in 9th grade detention, and they gave me an ultimatum: They said, "Either you stay in detention, or you go to this thing called Eco Club." And I said, "What?!? Eco Club? Forget you!" But I took a chance and I went over to Eco Club. And the first thing that they said was, "Grab a bag of seeds and let's go out." And I picked jalapeños because I wanted to grill salsa for my mom at the end of that. And they tricked me! Then all of a sudden, I started worrying about photosynthesis and the pH balance, and the UV radiation, and all this different stuff that would make my jalapeños grow. At the end of that semester, they gave me an opportunity to go to the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming. For a kid who has never been out of South Central, to see mountains for the first time, to look up at the night sky and count, I couldn't even count, the stars. For the first time in my life at the age of 15 I saw more stars than I could count. I had to pinch myself and look at that shooting star and say, "No, that's not the ghetto bird coming up at me." And the ghetto bird, you won't find in the Audobon book, it's a police helicopter in case you don't know. And I went back home and I found mentors and friends and family and people who supported me in this, and in 2005, this guy named Richard Louv wrote a book called Last Child in the Woods, and he coined a phrase called "nature-deficit disorder". It's not a medical term, don't worry, you don't have to take drugs for it, it's an easy fix: all you have to do is get outside. Because we have 7 billion people in the world today, but if you were to put all those 7 billion people shoulder-to-shoulder with each other, they could all fit in the city of L.A. It's not necessarily that we are running out of space, it's how we are using that space up. The average U.S. teenager now spends somewhere between 40 and 65 hours a week connected to some type of media device, some kind of technology. That's a full-time job! We're not saying that its bad, we're just saying get out, have fun! And I got together with some friends and we created this thing called the "Natural Leaders Network". And we wanted to find out how other people are getting outside all over the world. We thought it was just us here in the U.S., but no, no, it's all over the world. And we started getting amazing things back: the beaches, the mountains, in the middle of the city, how people got out, just the pure joy of celebrating our connection with nature. And it all started with that one group. I want to give you this new motivation about a new nature movement, and 7 reasons for a new nature movement. You can create your own reasons, but these are 7 reasons that we're talking about. I'm going to speed up a little bit because of time. But, take it from these kids, let's go get outside! Last year I got to climb the grand Teton. I went from being that kid from South Central realizing that somehow I was connected to those mountains, that my community in South Central L.A. was connected to the mountains up there. And it all made sense, the world made sense to me. Science, and math, and history, and English, and all the different things that were happening in this world made sense to me because of that. I went out to be the first one to graduate from my family in high school. I'm the first one. I'm a National Geographic Explorer today. I do these amazing talks, and I'm not telling you these things so I can brag about it, or that I can show off, I'm telling you these things because if a kid from South Central who was about to be a gang member can grow up to be a National Geographic Explorer and sit here in front of you and address you like I am today, then don't ever, ever in your life doubt what you can do. At the end of the day, I do what I do because of my family. My family means the world to me and from this day forward, each one of you in this room is part of that family. I want you go to away with that and I'll leave it with this one quote, which has driven me to this point: "Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. We have seen the future, and the future is ours." It's your future, it's our future, so go get 'em!

**Question 6: How did the speaker's experience at the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming affect their perspective on life?**

Although this question does not directly ask where Martinez traveled to see mountains for the first time, it does mention the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. The options for Question 6 do not match the options for the ground truth MCQ, but the content and intent of the question are related.

However, if I had to choose a question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This might seem like a far-away place in a far-away land. My house is right there in the middle. This was 1992 L.A. Riots. And I remember being 8 years old and looking out there and thinking to myself, "This is it, this is game over. I'm done." The military came in, the cops came in, and I thought they were going to save us, and for some reason they kept on pointing the guns at my people. So I grew up angry, I grew up mad. I struggled watching my parents pay rent at the end of the month. Sometimes they had to take food out of their mouths so that we, my two younger sisters and I, could eat. And the people that I saw taking care of their family and taking care of business were the gang members. So I considered that as a career path, not because they were the ones that, you know, had the girls, had the cars, it was because they were the ones who took care of their families. And I love my family enough to even to consider that as a possibility. But it wasn't always bad. If you haven't put two and two together, I'm a Dodgers fan. I like the Dodgers even more so because Dodgers Stadium sits in the middle of the Elysian Park, one of the biggest parks in L.A., and I remember going out on the weekends with my family and for la carne asada and sharing our cultura and them taking me on trails and showing me all this amazing stuff that they knew. I grew up, I went to Dorsey High School. You might not know Dorsey that much, but you might know Crenshaw High School. Crenshaw and Dorsey are rival high schools, but they are more than just rivals in the traditional sense of rival high schools, they are the birth place of The Bloods and The Crips. So I was in 9th grade detention, and they gave me an ultimatum: They said, "Either you stay in detention, or you go to this thing called Eco Club." And I said, "What?!? Eco Club? Forget you!" But I took a chance and I went over to Eco Club. And the first thing that they said was, "Grab a bag of seeds and let's go out." And I picked jalapeños because I wanted to grill salsa for my mom at the end of that. And they tricked me! Then all of a sudden, I started worrying about photosynthesis and the pH balance, and the UV radiation, and all this different stuff that would make my jalapeños grow. At the end of that semester, they gave me an opportunity to go to the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming. For a kid who has never been out of South Central, to see mountains for the first time, to look up at the night sky and count, I couldn't even count, the stars. For the first time in my life at the age of 15 I saw more stars than I could count. I had to pinch myself and look at that shooting star and say, "No, that's not the ghetto bird coming up at me." And the ghetto bird, you won't find in the Audobon book, it's a police helicopter in case you don't know. And I went back home and I found mentors and friends and family and people who supported me in this, and in 2005, this guy named Richard Louv wrote a book called Last Child in the Woods, and he coined a phrase called "nature-deficit disorder". It's not a medical term, don't worry, you don't have to take drugs for it, it's an easy fix: all you have to do is get outside. Because we have 7 billion people in the world today, but if you were to put all those 7 billion people shoulder-to-shoulder with each other, they could all fit in the city of L.A. It's not necessarily that we are running out of space, it's how we are using that space up. The average U.S. teenager now spends somewhere between 40 and 65 hours a week connected to some type of media device, some kind of technology. That's a full-time job! We're not saying that its bad, we're just saying get out, have fun! And I got together with some friends and we created this thing called the "Natural Leaders Network". And we wanted to find out how other people are getting outside all over the world. We thought it was just us here in the U.S., but no, no, it's all over the world. And we started getting amazing things back: the beaches, the mountains, in the middle of the city, how people got out, just the pure joy of celebrating our connection with nature. And it all started with that one group. I want to give you this new motivation about a new nature movement, and 7 reasons for a new nature movement.

For the first time in my life at the age of 15 I saw more stars than I could count. I had to pinch myself and look at that shooting star and say, "No, that's not the ghetto bird coming up at me." And the ghetto bird, you won't find in the Audobon book, it's a police helicopter in case you don't know. And I went back home and I found mentors and friends and family and people who supported me in this, and in 2005, this guy named Richard Louv wrote a book called Last Child in the Woods, and he coined a phrase called "nature-deficit disorder". It's not a medical term, don't worry, you don't have to take drugs for it, it's an easy fix: all you have to do is get outside. Because we have 7 billion people in the world today, but if you were to put all those 7 billion people shoulder-to-shoulder with each other, they could all fit in the city of L.A. It's not necessarily that we are running out of space, it's how we are using that space up. The average U.S. teenager now spends somewhere between 40 and 65 hours a week connected to some type of media device, some kind of technology. That's a full-time job! We're not saying that its bad, we're just saying get out, have fun! And I got together with some friends and we created this thing called the "Natural Leaders Network". And we wanted to find out how other people are getting outside all over the world. We thought it was just us here in the U.S., but no, no, it's all over the world. And we started getting amazing things back: the beaches, the mountains, in the middle of the city, how people got out, just the pure joy of celebrating our connection with nature. And it all started with that one group. I want to give you this new motivation about a new nature movement, and 7 reasons for a new nature movement. You can create your own reasons, but these are 7 reasons that we're talking about. I'm going to speed up a little bit because of time. But, take it from these kids, let's go get outside! Last year I got to climb the grand Teton. I went from being that kid from South Central realizing that somehow I was connected to those mountains, that my community in South Central L.A. was connected to the mountains up there. And it all made sense, the world made sense to me. Science, and math, and history, and English, and all the different things that were happening in this world made sense to me because of that. I went out to be the first one to graduate from my family in high school. I'm the first one. I'm a National Geographic Explorer today. I do these amazing talks, and I'm not telling you these things so I can brag about it, or that I can show off, I'm telling you these things because if a kid from South Central who was about to be a gang member can grow up to be a National Geographic Explorer and sit here in front of you and address you like I am today, then don't ever, ever in your life doubt what you can do. At the end of the day, I do what I do because of my family. My family means the world to me and from this day forward, each one of you in this room is part of that family. I want you go to away with that and I'll leave it with this one quote, which has driven me to this point: "Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. We have seen the future, and the future is ours." It's your future, it's our future, so go get 'em!

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the area that 7 billion people would occupy if they stood shoulder to shoulder. The closest generated MCQ is Question 4, which is about the primary contributor to "nature-deficit disorder" and mentions the excessive use of technology and media devices. However, this question does not directly relate to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant question would be one that discusses the speaker's statement about the 7 billion people and the area they would occupy. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with low confidence)

Note: A more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that directly address the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This might seem like a far-away place in a far-away land. My house is right there in the middle. This was 1992 L.A. Riots. And I remember being 8 years old and looking out there and thinking to myself, "This is it, this is game over. I'm done." The military came in, the cops came in, and I thought they were going to save us, and for some reason they kept on pointing the guns at my people. So I grew up angry, I grew up mad. I struggled watching my parents pay rent at the end of the month. Sometimes they had to take food out of their mouths so that we, my two younger sisters and I, could eat. And the people that I saw taking care of their family and taking care of business were the gang members. So I considered that as a career path, not because they were the ones that, you know, had the girls, had the cars, it was because they were the ones who took care of their families. And I love my family enough to even to consider that as a possibility. But it wasn't always bad. If you haven't put two and two together, I'm a Dodgers fan. I like the Dodgers even more so because Dodgers Stadium sits in the middle of the Elysian Park, one of the biggest parks in L.A., and I remember going out on the weekends with my family and for la carne asada and sharing our cultura and them taking me on trails and showing me all this amazing stuff that they knew. I grew up, I went to Dorsey High School. You might not know Dorsey that much, but you might know Crenshaw High School. Crenshaw and Dorsey are rival high schools, but they are more than just rivals in the traditional sense of rival high schools, they are the birth place of The Bloods and The Crips. So I was in 9th grade detention, and they gave me an ultimatum: They said, "Either you stay in detention, or you go to this thing called Eco Club." And I said, "What?!? Eco Club? Forget you!" But I took a chance and I went over to Eco Club. And the first thing that they said was, "Grab a bag of seeds and let's go out." And I picked jalapeños because I wanted to grill salsa for my mom at the end of that. And they tricked me! Then all of a sudden, I started worrying about photosynthesis and the pH balance, and the UV radiation, and all this different stuff that would make my jalapeños grow. At the end of that semester, they gave me an opportunity to go to the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming. For a kid who has never been out of South Central, to see mountains for the first time, to look up at the night sky and count, I couldn't even count, the stars.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Coral reefs are some of the most
spectacular ecosystems on the planet. They're also some of the most vulnerable. But how can we protect the reefs and the animals and plants
who rely on them? And how can we make sure our protected areas aren't hurting those
who use reefs to survive? These are some of the big questions facing marine conservation
biologists today. Let's take Fiji, for example. Fiji is series of islands
in the South Pacific Ocean. To help balance the need
for conservation and making a living, scientists had suggested
that instead of one big park which provides a lot of coverage
for one reef system while leaving the rest unprotected, a better way is to create
a system of protected areas nested together like pearls on a string. This idea is called connectivity. In this way, scientists can protect
lots of different habitats while not excluding people
from their traditional fishing grounds. Now, the only way this string-of-pearls
kind of reserve network is going to work is if each park is connected
to other parks. There are two main benefits to this. First of all, insurance. If something bad happens to one park, say, an oil spill or coral bleaching, then because that park
is part of a system, it can be reseeded from other parks
that escaped the event. The second benefit is representation. By conserving many different areas, scientists ensure that lots
of different habitats get protected. This way, they can make sure
all the different marine habitats in Fiji, such as coral reefs,
mangroves, and sea-grass beds, are all represented. This way, we don't unduly settle
any particular village or group of people with the economic burden of having
their fishing grounds off-limits. By sharing the cost
around the communities, they can also share the benefits. So if we agree
that rather than one big park, we should have lots of parks of different sizes
and covering different habitats, then scientists need to make sure
those smaller parks are connected, because if they're not,
they probably won't be self-sustaining. But how do we know that? That's where genetics and DNA come in. By looking at how closely related the fish in each one
of these small reserves in Fiji are to each other, scientists can figure out how much migration is going on
among the reserves within the system. Now it's important to look
at a variety of different species because there's no guarantee
that what's going on with these guys is what's going on with these guys. But if we look closely
and at enough species, we can see whether or not
the necklace is working. What scientists have found
so far is that, in general, there's a fair amount of connectivity
amongst the parks within Fiji. But it's not just a big free-for-all; rather, it seems that, for some species, babies born in the far west
are having a hard time making it to the islands in the far east. To help deal with that,
conservation biologists are suggesting that there be enough parks
in both the east and the west to keep the populations healthy. This isn't just in Fiji, either. Lessons about reserve connectivity
can help across the world. In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Bahamas, scientists are using a variety
of tools to help understand how individual parks
can function together, so that their sum is greater
than their whole. And this way, we can keep
the beautiful necklace that is our coral reefs, intact.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

The challenge is to protect coral reefs from climate change, which can be addressed by reducing carbon emissions., B. The challenge is to balance the need for conservation and the livelihoods of those who depend on reefs, which can be addressed by implementing sustainable fishing practices and establishing a connected system of protected areas., C. The challenge is to establish a single large park for conservation, which can be addressed by creating a network of protected areas., D. The challenge is to study the genetics and DNA of fish in coral reefs, which can be addressed by conducting extensive research. Correct Option: B
Question 2: What does the concept of "connectivity" refer to in the context of coral reef conservation, and what are its benefits? Options: A. Connectivity refers to protecting only coral reefs and excluding other marine habitats, which provides benefits such as increased biodiversity., B. Connectivity refers to establishing a network of protected areas that are linked together, which provides benefits such as insurance and representation., C. Connectivity refers to studying the genetics and DNA of fish in coral reefs, which provides benefits such as improved understanding of migration patterns., D. Connectivity refers to creating a single large park for conservation, which provides benefits such as increased protection and reduced human impact. Correct Option: B
Question 3: What are the two primary benefits of a "string-of-pearls" reserve network, and how do they contribute to effective coral reef conservation? Options: A. The benefits are insurance and representation, which contribute to effective conservation by providing a safeguard against catastrophic events and ensuring the protection of diverse habitats., B. The benefits are conservation and research, which contribute to effective conservation by protecting coral reefs and advancing scientific knowledge., C. The benefits are protection and education, which contribute to effective conservation by safeguarding coral reefs and raising awareness about their importance., D. The benefits are tourism and recreation, which contribute to effective conservation by generating revenue and promoting sustainable tourism practices. Correct Option: A
Question 4: How do scientists determine if a system of protected areas is connected and self-sustaining, and what tools do they use to make this assessment? Options: A. Scientists determine connectivity by analyzing the size and shape of the protected areas, using tools such as geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing., B. Scientists determine connectivity by studying the economic benefits of the protected areas, using tools such as cost-benefit analysis and economic modeling., C. Scientists determine connectivity by examining the genetic relationships among fish in each reserve, using tools such as genetic analysis and DNA sequencing., D.

Question 5: Why is it essential to study a variety of different species in a system of protected areas, and what are the implications of not doing so? Options: A. Studying multiple species is essential because all species have the same migration patterns, and not doing so would lead to incomplete understanding of ecosystem dynamics., B. Studying multiple species is essential because different species have different migration patterns, and not doing so would lead to inadequate representation of ecosystem diversity., C. Studying multiple species is essential because some species are more important than others, and not doing so would lead to neglect of key species., D. Studying multiple species is essential because it is easier to study a single species, and not doing so would lead to increased complexity and cost. Correct Option: B
Question 6: What have scientists discovered regarding the connectivity of parks within Fiji, and what are the implications of these findings? Options: A. Scientists have discovered that there is no connectivity among the parks, which implies that the parks are not self-sustaining and require additional conservation efforts., B. Scientists have discovered that there is a moderate level of connectivity among the parks, with some limitations, which implies that the parks are partially self-sustaining but require additional conservation efforts to address the limitations., C. Scientists have discovered that the parks are all completely self-sustaining, which implies that no additional conservation efforts are needed., D. Scientists have discovered that the parks are all connected, with no limitations, which implies that the parks are fully self-sustaining and require no additional conservation efforts. Correct Option: B
Question 7: How can lessons about reserve connectivity in Fiji be applied to other parts of the world, and what are the potential benefits of doing so? Options: A. Lessons from Fiji can be applied by creating a single large park for conservation in each country, which would provide benefits such as increased protection and reduced human impact., B. Lessons from Fiji can be applied by using a variety of tools to understand how individual parks can function together, which would provide benefits such as improved conservation outcomes and increased ecosystem resilience., C. Lessons from Fiji can be applied by studying only coral reefs and excluding other marine habitats, which would provide benefits such as increased biodiversity and improved ecosystem health., D. Lessons from Fiji can be applied by ignoring the economic benefits of protected areas, which would provide benefits such as increased conservation effectiveness and reduced costs. Correct Option: B
Question 8: What is the potential consequence of not having a connected system of protected areas, and how can this be addressed? Options: A. The consequence is that the protected areas will become too large, which can be addressed by reducing the size of the protected areas., B. The consequence is that the protected areas will become too small, which can be addressed by increasing the size of the protected areas., C. The consequence is that the protected areas will not be self-sustaining, which can be addressed by establishing connectivity among the protected areas., D. The consequence is that the protected areas will be too expensive to maintain, which can be addressed by reducing the costs of maintaining the protected areas. Correct Option: C
Question 9: How can a connected system of protected areas benefit local communities, and what are the implications of not involving local communities in conservation efforts? Options: A. A connected system can benefit local communities by excluding them from their traditional fishing grounds, which would imply that local communities are not important stakeholders in conservation efforts., B. A connected system can benefit local communities by providing economic benefits and sharing the costs, which would imply that local communities are essential stakeholders in conservation efforts., C. A connected system can benefit local communities by creating a single large park for conservation, which would imply that local communities are not necessary for conservation efforts., D. A connected system can benefit local communities by ignoring their needs and concerns, which would imply that local communities are not important stakeholders in conservation efforts. Correct Option: B
Question 10: What is the ultimate goal of coral reef conservation efforts, and how can it be achieved? Options: A. The ultimate goal is to protect coral reefs from human impacts, which can be achieved by establishing a connected system of protected areas., B.

to other parks. There are two main benefits to this. First of all, insurance. If something bad happens to one park, say, an oil spill or coral bleaching, then because that park
is part of a system, it can be reseeded from other parks
that escaped the event. The second benefit is representation. By conserving many different areas, scientists ensure that lots
of different habitats get protected. This way, they can make sure
all the different marine habitats in Fiji, such as coral reefs,
mangroves, and sea-grass beds, are all represented. This way, we don't unduly settle
any particular village or group of people with the economic burden of having
their fishing grounds off-limits. By sharing the cost
around the communities, they can also share the benefits. So if we agree
that rather than one big park, we should have lots of parks of different sizes
and covering different habitats, then scientists need to make sure
those smaller parks are connected, because if they're not,
they probably won't be self-sustaining. But how do we know that? That's where genetics and DNA come in. By looking at how closely related the fish in each one
of these small reserves in Fiji are to each other, scientists can figure out how much migration is going on
among the reserves within the system. Now it's important to look
at a variety of different species because there's no guarantee
that what's going on with these guys is what's going on with these guys. But if we look closely
and at enough species, we can see whether or not
the necklace is working. What scientists have found
so far is that, in general, there's a fair amount of connectivity
amongst the parks within Fiji. But it's not just a big free-for-all; rather, it seems that, for some species, babies born in the far west
are having a hard time making it to the islands in the far east. To help deal with that,
conservation biologists are suggesting that there be enough parks
in both the east and the west to keep the populations healthy. This isn't just in Fiji, either. Lessons about reserve connectivity
can help across the world. In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Bahamas, scientists are using a variety
of tools to help understand how individual parks
can function together, so that their sum is greater
than their whole. And this way, we can keep
the beautiful necklace that is our coral reefs, intact.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the major habitats surrounding Fiji and which one is not a major habitat, whereas the generated MCQs focus on various aspects of coral reef conservation, such as connectivity, benefits of protected areas, and conservation efforts.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 2, which mentions coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds as part of the concept of "connectivity" in coral reef conservation. Although this question does not directly ask about the major habitats surrounding Fiji, it does mention some of the habitats mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

that escaped the event. The second benefit is representation. By conserving many different areas, scientists ensure that lots
of different habitats get protected. This way, they can make sure
all the different marine habitats in Fiji, such as coral reefs,
mangroves, and sea-grass beds, are all represented. This way, we don't unduly settle
any particular village or group of people with the economic burden of having
their fishing grounds off-limits. By sharing the cost
around the communities, they can also share the benefits. So if we agree
that rather than one big park, we should have lots of parks of different sizes
and covering different habitats, then scientists need to make sure
those smaller parks are connected, because if they're not,
they probably won't be self-sustaining. But how do we know that? That's where genetics and DNA come in. By looking at how closely related the fish in each one
of these small reserves in Fiji are to each other, scientists can figure out how much migration is going on
among the reserves within the system. Now it's important to look
at a variety of different species because there's no guarantee
that what's going on with these guys is what's going on with these guys. But if we look closely
and at enough species, we can see whether or not
the necklace is working. What scientists have found
so far is that, in general, there's a fair amount of connectivity
amongst the parks within Fiji. But it's not just a big free-for-all; rather, it seems that, for some species, babies born in the far west
are having a hard time making it to the islands in the far east. To help deal with that,
conservation biologists are suggesting that there be enough parks
in both the east and the west to keep the populations healthy. This isn't just in Fiji, either. Lessons about reserve connectivity
can help across the world. In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Bahamas, scientists are using a variety
of tools to help understand how individual parks
can function together, so that their sum is greater
than their whole. And this way, we can keep
the beautiful necklace that is our coral reefs, intact.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] let's just start by looking at some great photographs this is an icon of National Geographic an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry but the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic and I shudder to think what they are going to do to this photograph oh the wrath of Photoshop this is a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale oh he mounted the camera on the tail poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas bronze sculptures the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklin polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth they're not very good swimmers and we know what's happening into the ice these are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa photographed by Chris John's shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels this is a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard a great portraitist and Jane Goodall making her own special connection photographed by Nick Nichols this is a soap disco in Spain photographed by David Alan Harvey and David said that there was a lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but hey it's at least it's hygienic these are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance by David Doubilet and this is a comet captured by dr. you and Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic without movie stars photographed by Emory Kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl today's saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here's an example four years ago I was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware Beaches but I turned away for a moment and he got caught into a Riptide and started to be pulled out towards a jetty I went I can stand here right now and see as I go tearing into the water after him the moment slowing down and freezing into this arrangement I can see the rocks are over here there's a wave about to crash onto him I can see his hands reaching out and I can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad I got him the wave break Oh broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it's called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer now I have to tell you I was talking to Kyle last week about this that I was going to tell this story he said oh yeah I remember that too I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me I thought I was a hero so this represents this is a across sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photo journalists working at the very top of their craft except one this photograph was taken by dr. Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in Chad called zoo coma the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what Nick did up to a point this is a serval cat he's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's cutting across and he stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole Nick or the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of a lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of zoo coma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa here's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for that was with the elephants this story pivoted Nick along with researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her Annie and they began tracking her movements the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of Park Rangers but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd and they only came for the ivory and this is actually one of the Rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there that it was still valuable but what Nick did was he brought back with it was a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the Rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflict now let's go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live in urban rather than rural environs and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them Jonas bendixson a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my here's my proposal let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of Mumbai India and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really you know major part of the city what Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exists in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned by staying tightly focused in one place Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community and he did it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with the sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer Brian scary and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that Bryan and Randy created are among the best capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja I've seen sort of okay pictures of by catch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to Europe and here in China Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain but there are also glimmers of hope and I think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we're not only going we're not we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions and Brian photographed a Marine Sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who was honored last year at last year's Ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other Jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fitted with high-tech prothesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you could imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins you know of the march of the Penguins this is sort of the munch of the Penguins here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out but then Paul got in the water and he he said he was never really afraid of this well this this one female came up to him she's probably it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph but she's 12 feet long so she is pretty significant in size and Paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how look how big I am or you know my what big teeth you have then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him she dropped them off and then they would swim away she kind of look at him go what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him she did this for over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head it's just resulted in a fantastic photograph eventually though Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her kind of just puffing out you know snorting out and sort of disgust and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and came back with not just a collection of photographs but an amazing experience and a great story it is these kinds of stories ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism I believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the incident that David and his son remember so differently, it does reference the same story and the concept of a "flashbulb memory" that David describes when recalling his son's near-drowning experience at the beach. However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an answer, I would say Question 2 is the closest match, but I would rate the similarity as low.

A better option would be to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the incident, such as:

Question: What incident did David recall as an example of a flashbulb memory?
Options: A. His son was caught in a riptide, B. He was caught in a storm while hiking, C. He witnessed a car accident, D. He experienced a medical emergency.

This new MCQ would be a much closer match to the ground truth MCQ.

[Music] [Applause] let's just start by looking at some great photographs this is an icon of National Geographic an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry but the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic and I shudder to think what they are going to do to this photograph oh the wrath of Photoshop this is a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale oh he mounted the camera on the tail poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas bronze sculptures the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklin polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth they're not very good swimmers and we know what's happening into the ice these are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa photographed by Chris John's shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels this is a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard a great portraitist and Jane Goodall making her own special connection photographed by Nick Nichols this is a soap disco in Spain photographed by David Alan Harvey and David said that there was a lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but hey it's at least it's hygienic these are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance by David Doubilet and this is a comet captured by dr. you and Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic without movie stars photographed by Emory Kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl today's saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here's an example four years ago I was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware Beaches but I turned away for a moment and he got caught into a Riptide and started to be pulled out towards a jetty I went I can stand here right now and see as I go tearing into the water after him the moment slowing down and freezing into this arrangement I can see the rocks are over here there's a wave about to crash onto him I can see his hands reaching out and I can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad I got him the wave break Oh broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it's called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer now I have to tell you I was talking to Kyle last week about this that I was going to tell this story he said oh yeah I remember that too I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me I thought I was a hero so this represents this is a across sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photo journalists working at the very top of their craft except one this photograph was taken by dr. Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in Chad called zoo coma the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what Nick did up to a point this is a serval cat he's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's cutting across and he stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole Nick or the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of a lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of zoo coma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa here's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for that was with the elephants this story pivoted Nick along with researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her Annie and they began tracking her movements the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of Park Rangers but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd and they only came for the ivory and this is actually one of the Rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there that it was still valuable but what Nick did was he brought back with it was a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the Rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflict now let's go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live in urban rather than rural environs and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them Jonas bendixson a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my here's my proposal let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of Mumbai India and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really you know major part of the city what Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exists in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned by staying tightly focused in one place Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community and he did it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with the sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer Brian scary and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that Bryan and Randy created are among the best capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja I've seen sort of okay pictures of by catch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to Europe and here in China Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain but there are also glimmers of hope and I think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we're not only going we're not we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions and Brian photographed a Marine Sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who was honored last year at last year's Ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other Jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fitted with high-tech prothesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you could imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins you know of the march of the Penguins this is sort of the munch of the Penguins here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out but then Paul got in the water and he he said he was never really afraid of this well this this one female came up to him she's probably it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph but she's 12 feet long so she is pretty significant in size and Paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how look how big I am or you know my what big teeth you have then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him she dropped them off and then they would swim away she kind of look at him go what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him she did this for over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head it's just resulted in a fantastic photograph eventually though Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her kind of just puffing out you know snorting out and sort of disgust and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and came back with not just a collection of photographs but an amazing experience and a great story it is these kinds of stories ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism I believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today thank you

Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in Chad called zoo coma the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what Nick did up to a point this is a serval cat he's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's cutting across and he stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole Nick or the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of a lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of zoo coma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa here's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for that was with the elephants this story pivoted Nick along with researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her Annie and they began tracking her movements the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of Park Rangers but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd and they only came for the ivory and this is actually one of the Rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there that it was still valuable but what Nick did was he brought back with it was a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the Rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflict now let's go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live in urban rather than rural environs and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them Jonas bendixson a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my here's my proposal let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of Mumbai India and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really you know major part of the city what Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exists in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned by staying tightly focused in one place Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community and he did it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with the sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer Brian scary and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that Bryan and Randy created are among the best capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja I've seen sort of okay pictures of by catch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to Europe and here in China Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain but there are also glimmers of hope and I think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we're not only going we're not we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions and Brian photographed a Marine Sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who was honored last year at last year's Ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other Jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fitted with high-tech prothesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you could imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins you know of the march of the Penguins this is sort of the munch of the Penguins here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out but then Paul got in the water and he he said he was never really afraid of this well this this one female came up to him she's probably it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph but she's 12 feet long so she is pretty significant in size and Paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how look how big I am or you know my what big teeth you have then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him she dropped them off and then they would swim away she kind of look at him go what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him she did this for over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head it's just resulted in a fantastic photograph eventually though Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her kind of just puffing out you know snorting out and sort of disgust and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and came back with not just a collection of photographs but an amazing experience and a great story it is these kinds of stories ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism I believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today thank you

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a potential match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the largest source of food in the world, with options including "Ocean" as the correct answer. Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the largest source of food. However, Question 1 mentions the percentage of the Earth's surface inhabited by humans and notes that the remaining 70% is the ocean, which is the largest source of food. But this is not a direct match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can propose a new MCQ that could be a potential match:

Question: What is the largest source of food in the world?
Options: A. Land, B. Ocean, C. Farms, D. Forests
Correct Option: B

Since this MCQ is not among the generated ones, I will not provide an index. However, if I had to choose the most relevant generated MCQ, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's not a direct match.

Index: No direct match (but Question 1 is the closest)

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nearly every one of your science classes starts off with the scientific method. You recognize this? Ask a question, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, collect data, draw conclusions, and then memorize a bunch of facts. This is really boring! Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook, and learning is not memorizing facts for tests. Yet, that is exactly what we do. We have to change this! We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society by looking towards tomorrow, by going through a path from involvement to imagination to invention to innovation. And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story about how we discovered how geckos stick. First you need to get involved. You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself. We know that learning by being an active researcher is the best way to learn. Imagine being in my lab and trying to discover how geckos stick. "Here is one of our subjects. This is a crested gecko. We are going to put the gecko on glass and we're going to use a high speed camera that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second. There he goes. OK, record it. There's the animal's toes." "So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?" How do they do this? We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right? It's hard to believe. Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes, and those hairs are really small compared to your hair, and the little tips at the end are even smaller. Well, my student Tanya, who is not much older than some of you when she did this, a sophomore undergraduate, tried to figure this out, and we told that her that in order to do this, you'd have to measure the force of a single hair. Though we kind of only did this jokingly because these hairs are so small, we didn't think it was possible. But Tanya didn't know that, and she went on to build the simplest, most beautiful measurement device ever. Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nearly every one of your science classes starts off with the scientific method. You recognize this? Ask a question, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, collect data, draw conclusions, and then memorize a bunch of facts. This is really boring! Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook, and learning is not memorizing facts for tests. Yet, that is exactly what we do. We have to change this! We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society by looking towards tomorrow, by going through a path from involvement to imagination to invention to innovation. And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story about how we discovered how geckos stick. First you need to get involved. You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself. We know that learning by being an active researcher is the best way to learn. Imagine being in my lab and trying to discover how geckos stick. "Here is one of our subjects. This is a crested gecko. We are going to put the gecko on glass and we're going to use a high speed camera that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second. There he goes. OK, record it. There's the animal's toes." "So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?" How do they do this? We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right? It's hard to believe. Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes, and those hairs are really small compared to your hair, and the little tips at the end are even smaller. Well, my student Tanya, who is not much older than some of you when she did this, a sophomore undergraduate, tried to figure this out, and we told that her that in order to do this, you'd have to measure the force of a single hair. Though we kind of only did this jokingly because these hairs are so small, we didn't think it was possible. But Tanya didn't know that, and she went on to build the simplest, most beautiful measurement device ever. Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is unique about the hairs on a gecko's toes that allows them to stick to surfaces?**

However, this question does not directly ask about the force of a single hair. A more relevant question would be one that asks about the measurement or property of the gecko's hair that Tanya needed to figure out.

A closer match would be a question that asks about the force or property of the gecko's hair. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the force of a single hair.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 4: How do geckos stick to surfaces, according to the research mentioned in the transcript?** is the closest match, as it is related to the property of the gecko's hair that allows them to stick to surfaces.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question is about the unique properties of gecko hair, specifically what allows them to stick to surfaces. The correct option, B, mentions split ends that help create inter-molecular forces, which is related to the information provided in the ground truth MCQ. Although the ground truth MCQ asks which statement is not true about a gecko's hairy feet, and Question 3 asks what is unique about the hairs on a gecko's toes, both questions are focused on the properties of gecko hair and its ability to stick to surfaces.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 4, is also closely related to the ground truth MCQ. It asks how geckos stick to surfaces, and the correct option, C, mentions inter-molecular forces, specifically van der Waals forces, which is also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

But if we consider the question content and options more closely, we can see that Question 3 is more focused on the properties of gecko hair, while Question 4 is more focused on the mechanism of how geckos stick to surfaces.

Considering all the generated MCQs again, we can see that Question 3 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nearly every one of your science classes starts off with the scientific method. You recognize this? Ask a question, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, collect data, draw conclusions, and then memorize a bunch of facts. This is really boring! Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook, and learning is not memorizing facts for tests. Yet, that is exactly what we do. We have to change this! We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society by looking towards tomorrow, by going through a path from involvement to imagination to invention to innovation. And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story about how we discovered how geckos stick. First you need to get involved. You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself. We know that learning by being an active researcher is the best way to learn. Imagine being in my lab and trying to discover how geckos stick. "Here is one of our subjects. This is a crested gecko. We are going to put the gecko on glass and we're going to use a high speed camera that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second. There he goes. OK, record it. There's the animal's toes." "So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?" How do they do this? We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right? It's hard to believe. Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes, and those hairs are really small compared to your hair, and the little tips at the end are even smaller. Well, my student Tanya, who is not much older than some of you when she did this, a sophomore undergraduate, tried to figure this out, and we told that her that in order to do this, you'd have to measure the force of a single hair. Though we kind of only did this jokingly because these hairs are so small, we didn't think it was possible. But Tanya didn't know that, and she went on to build the simplest, most beautiful measurement device ever. Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Tap dance: one of America's major contributions to the world of percussive dance, born out of the melding of African and European dance traditions. There's so many variations within tap dance, as many approaches as there have been tap dancers. And there have been a lot! Since its birth, over 125 years ago, tap dance has grown up in the world of American popular entertainment. From minstral shows and vaudeville, to night clubs, musical theater, and movie musicals, tap dance has held a featured role. And your approach depends on when in the history's lineage you decide to connect. The landscape of American entertainment shifted in the 1950s and 60s. Big bands became cost-prohibitive, rock and roll was becoming a popular music, and American musical theater moved towards a format incorporating ballet with narrative rather than the extension of variety shows that it had been in the past. All these factors pushed tap dancing to the fringes of the entertainment world. Tap dance still existed; there were dancers, but it was outside of the popular discourse. There were fewer and fewer places to dance and very little need for new tap dancers, so those who have been dancing in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, really had no one to pass along the art form to. In the 1970s, a multifaceted resurgence began. Modern dancers became interested in the older tap dancers, drawing them out of retirement to teach. Grassroots-organized tap festivals began to spring up, featuring the older tap dancers teaching the technique and the history of the craft. Older dancers also came out of retirement to perform with groups such as The Copasetics and The Original Hoofers, traveling the world. Even Broadway regained interest in the form, with Gregory Hines becoming a public figure for tap dance on the stage and in feature films. Since then, the resurgence has spawned a more popular interest, with Savion Glover at the nexus of the crowd. Considered the quintessential tap dancer, Glover presents the form as a pure musician. Since the 1990s, and thanks in a large part to the work of Savion Glover, we've seen a rise in young people's interest in tap dance. I'm part of that generation. Today, as we begin to rediscover the craft, we continue to look back and take examples of what tap dance was from past generations, at the same time, discovering our own unique approaches. There is so much freedom today. We can take what exists and apply past examples within our own unique context - today's perspective on tap dance. It all really boils down to two pieces of metal on a leather-soled shoe, the wood to dance on, an audience to watch and listen, and something to say. It's the balancing of these elements that is a tap dancer's craft work.

Grassroots-organized tap festivals began to spring up, featuring the older tap dancers teaching the technique and the history of the craft. Older dancers also came out of retirement to perform with groups such as The Copasetics and The Original Hoofers, traveling the world. Even Broadway regained interest in the form, with Gregory Hines becoming a public figure for tap dance on the stage and in feature films. Since then, the resurgence has spawned a more popular interest, with Savion Glover at the nexus of the crowd. Considered the quintessential tap dancer, Glover presents the form as a pure musician. Since the 1990s, and thanks in a large part to the work of Savion Glover, we've seen a rise in young people's interest in tap dance. I'm part of that generation. Today, as we begin to rediscover the craft, we continue to look back and take examples of what tap dance was from past generations, at the same time, discovering our own unique approaches. There is so much freedom today. We can take what exists and apply past examples within our own unique context - today's perspective on tap dance. It all really boils down to two pieces of metal on a leather-soled shoe, the wood to dance on, an audience to watch and listen, and something to say. It's the balancing of these elements that is a tap dancer's craft work.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Tap dance: one of America's major contributions to the world of percussive dance, born out of the melding of African and European dance traditions. There's so many variations within tap dance, as many approaches as there have been tap dancers. And there have been a lot! Since its birth, over 125 years ago, tap dance has grown up in the world of American popular entertainment. From minstral shows and vaudeville, to night clubs, musical theater, and movie musicals, tap dance has held a featured role. And your approach depends on when in the history's lineage you decide to connect. The landscape of American entertainment shifted in the 1950s and 60s.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not directly ask about the number of styles in tap dance, its options and content address the idea of tap dance being a rigid and traditional art form (Option A) versus being vibrant and evolving (Option C). This indirectly relates to the idea of there being only one style of tap dance (as stated in the ground truth MCQ) versus multiple styles and approaches.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of styles or approaches in tap dance. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 7, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

One of the most striking properties
about life is that it has color. To understand the phenomenon of color,
it helps to think about light as a wave. But, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit
about waves in general. Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean
watching a cork bob up and down in the water. The first thing you notice about
the motion is that it repeats itself. The cork traces the same path over and
over again... up and down, up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion
is characteristic of waves. Then you notice something else... using a stopwatch, you measure
the time it takes for the piece of cork to go over its highest position down
to its lowest and then back up again. Suppose this takes two seconds. To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on. That is, how long it takes a wave to go
through its full range of motion once. The same information can be expressed
in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency. Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you
how frequent the waves are. That is, how many of them
go by in one second. If you know how many seconds
one full wave takes, then it's easy to work out
how many waves go by in one second. In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second. So enough about bobbing corks...
What about light and color? If light is a wave, then it must
have a frequency. Right? Well... yes, it does. And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It's called color. That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure
of how quickly the light waves are waving. If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly, like we can with the cork and the ocean. But the frequency of the light
we see is so high, it waves up and down about
400 million million times a second, that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is. The lowest frequency light that we can see
is red and the highest frequency is purple. In between all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum. So, what if you had a yellow pencil
sitting on your desk? Well, the sun emits all colors of light,
so light of all colors is hitting your pencil. The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors. What happens to the blue,
purple and red light? They get absorbed and the energy
they are carrying is turned into heat. It is similar with objects
of other colors. Blue things reflect blue light,
red things reflect red light and so on. White objects reflect all colors of light, while black things do exactly the opposite
and absorb at all frequencies. This - by the way - is why it's uncomfortable
to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: According to Kelleher, what is the first step in understanding the phenomenon of color?

Question 2: If a wave takes 4 seconds to complete its full range of motion, what is its frequency? Options: A. 0.25 waves per second, B. 0.5 waves per second, C. 1 wave per second, D. 2 waves per second Correct Option: A
Question 3: What is the relationship between the frequency of light and the color we perceive? Options: A. Color is a measure of the amplitude of light waves, B. Color is a measure of the frequency of light waves, C. Color is a measure of the speed of light waves, D. Color is a measure of the wavelength of light waves Correct Option: B
Question 4: Why do objects appear colored to us? Options: A. Because they absorb all colors of light, B. Because they reflect all colors of light, C. Because they reflect certain colors of light more than others, D. Because they emit certain colors of light Correct Option: C
Question 5: What happens to the energy carried by light that is absorbed by an object? Options: A. It is reflected back into the environment, B. It is transmitted through the object, C. It is turned into heat, D. It is stored in the object Correct Option: C
Question 6: A white object is placed in a beam of light containing all colors of the visible spectrum. What will happen to the light? Options: A. All colors will be absorbed, B. All colors will be reflected, C. Some colors will be absorbed, while others will be reflected, D. The light will be transmitted through the object Correct Option: B
Question 7: If you were to wear a black t-shirt on a sunny day, what would happen to the light that hits it? Options: A. It would be reflected back into the environment, B. It would be transmitted through the t-shirt, C. It would be absorbed and turned into heat, D. It would be stored in the t-shirt Correct Option: C
Question 8: Suppose you have a red ball, a blue ball, and a yellow ball. If you shine a light containing all colors of the visible spectrum on each ball, what will happen to the light that hits each ball? Options: A. The red ball will absorb all colors, the blue ball will reflect all colors, and the yellow ball will transmit all colors, B. The red ball will reflect red light, the blue ball will reflect blue light, and the yellow ball will reflect yellow light, C. The red ball will absorb all colors except red, the blue ball will absorb all colors except blue, and the yellow ball will absorb all colors except yellow, D.

Question 10: Imagine you are designing a new material that you want to appear green in color. What property would you need to give the material in order for it to appear green? Options: A. The ability to absorb all colors of light, B. The ability to reflect all colors of light, C. The ability to reflect green light more than other colors, D. The ability to transmit green light Correct Option: C

**Transcript**:
One of the most striking properties
about life is that it has color. To understand the phenomenon of color,
it helps to think about light as a wave. But, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit
about waves in general. Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean
watching a cork bob up and down in the water. The first thing you notice about
the motion is that it repeats itself. The cork traces the same path over and
over again... up and down, up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion
is characteristic of waves. Then you notice something else... using a stopwatch, you measure
the time it takes for the piece of cork to go over its highest position down
to its lowest and then back up again. Suppose this takes two seconds. To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on. That is, how long it takes a wave to go
through its full range of motion once. The same information can be expressed
in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency. Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you
how frequent the waves are. That is, how many of them
go by in one second. If you know how many seconds
one full wave takes, then it's easy to work out
how many waves go by in one second. In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second. So enough about bobbing corks...
What about light and color? If light is a wave, then it must
have a frequency. Right? Well... yes, it does. And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It's called color. That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure
of how quickly the light waves are waving. If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly, like we can with the cork and the ocean. But the frequency of the light
we see is so high, it waves up and down about
400 million million times a second, that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is. The lowest frequency light that we can see
is red and the highest frequency is purple. In between all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum. So, what if you had a yellow pencil
sitting on your desk? Well, the sun emits all colors of light,
so light of all colors is hitting your pencil. The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors. What happens to the blue,
purple and red light? They get absorbed and the energy
they are carrying is turned into heat. It is similar with objects
of other colors. Blue things reflect blue light,
red things reflect red light and so on. White objects reflect all colors of light, while black things do exactly the opposite
and absorb at all frequencies. This - by the way - is why it's uncomfortable
to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the period of a wave, it is related to the concept of measuring the time it takes for a wave to complete its full range of motion, which is the definition of period. The correct option for Question 2 (A. 0.25 waves per second) is calculated based on the period of the wave (4 seconds), which shows an understanding of the relationship between period and frequency.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about what is being measured when measuring the period of a wave, whereas the generated MCQs focus on related concepts such as frequency and wave characteristics.

If I had to choose the most similar one, I would say Question 2 is the closest match, but a more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the definition of period, which is not present among the generated MCQs.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

This question asks what happens to light when a white object is placed in a beam of light containing all colors of the visible spectrum. The correct answer is that all colors will be reflected, which aligns with the statement in the ground truth MCQ that white objects reflect all colors of light. Additionally, this question is related to the statement in the ground truth MCQ that black objects absorb all colors of light, as it provides a contrast to how white objects interact with light.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. This question asks what happens to light when it hits a black t-shirt, and the correct answer is that it would be absorbed and turned into heat. This aligns with the statement in the ground truth MCQ that black objects absorb all colors of light.

Between Questions 6 and 7, Question 6 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ because it directly addresses the behavior of both white and black objects in relation to light, whereas Question 7 only addresses black objects.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy because of the letter "b". Since it doesn't spell a sound, most folks can't figure out what it's doing there. But in spite of what most of us learn in school, sound is never the most important aspect of spelling an English word. A word's meaning and history need to come first. To doubt means to question, to waver, to hesitate. As a noun, it means uncertainty or confusion. The present-day English word "doubt" started as a Latin word, "dubitare". It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both its "buh" sound and its letter "b". And then it came into English in the 13th century. About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the "b" into the word's spelling, even though no one pronounced it that way. But why would they do this? Why would anyone in their right mind reinsert a silent letter into a spelling? Well, because they knew Latin, the scribes understood that the root of "doubt" had a "b" in it. Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin, the "b" was kept because it marked important, meaningful connections to other related words, like "dubious" and "indubitalbly," which were subsequently borrowed into English from the same Latin root, "dubitare". Understanding these historical connections not only helped us to spell "doubt," but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words. But the story doesn't end there. If we look even deeper, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt, just how revealing that "b" can be. There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters "d-o-u-b": one is doubt, and the other is double. We can build lots of other words on each of these bases, like doubtful and doubtless, or doublet, and redouble, and doubloon. It turns out that if we look into their history, we can see that they both derive from the same Latin forms. The meaning of double, two, is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt. See, when we doubt, when we hesitate, we second guess ourselves. When we have doubts about something, when we have questions or confusion, we are of two minds. Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt. That Old English word was "tweogan," a word whose relationship to "two" is clear in its spelling as well. So the next time you are in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does, take a second look. What you find just might make you do a double-take.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy because of the letter "b". Since it doesn't spell a sound, most folks can't figure out what it's doing there. But in spite of what most of us learn in school, sound is never the most important aspect of spelling an English word. A word's meaning and history need to come first. To doubt means to question, to waver, to hesitate. As a noun, it means uncertainty or confusion. The present-day English word "doubt" started as a Latin word, "dubitare". It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both its "buh" sound and its letter "b". And then it came into English in the 13th century. About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the "b" into the word's spelling, even though no one pronounced it that way. But why would they do this? Why would anyone in their right mind reinsert a silent letter into a spelling? Well, because they knew Latin, the scribes understood that the root of "doubt" had a "b" in it. Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin, the "b" was kept because it marked important, meaningful connections to other related words, like "dubious" and "indubitalbly," which were subsequently borrowed into English from the same Latin root, "dubitare". Understanding these historical connections not only helped us to spell "doubt," but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words. But the story doesn't end there. If we look even deeper, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt, just how revealing that "b" can be. There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters "d-o-u-b": one is doubt, and the other is double. We can build lots of other words on each of these bases, like doubtful and doubtless, or doublet, and redouble, and doubloon. It turns out that if we look into their history, we can see that they both derive from the same Latin forms. The meaning of double, two, is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt. See, when we doubt, when we hesitate, we second guess ourselves. When we have doubts about something, when we have questions or confusion, we are of two minds. Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt. That Old English word was "tweogan," a word whose relationship to "two" is clear in its spelling as well. So the next time you are in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does, take a second look. What you find just might make you do a double-take.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Picture this: your friend and you are watching a sitcom and a sassy sidekick walks into a room, carrying a four-tiered wedding cake. He trips, falls, and face-plants into the cake. Your friend doubles over with laughter and says, "It's so ridiculous! So ironic!" Well, quick, what do you do? Do you laugh along with the laugh track and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go? Or, do you throw caution to the wind and explain the true meaning of irony? If you're me, you choose the latter. Unfortunately, irony has been completely misunderstood. We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny or coincidental. And while many examples of true irony can be funny, that is not the driving factor of being ironic. A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact opposite of what was expected. If you expect A, but get B, then you have irony. Let's take the slap-stick cake situation as an example. When someone walks in precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone, trips, falls, and makes a mess, it is funny, but it's not ironic. In fact, you probably expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip. When he does, reality aligns with expectations, and so that is not irony. But what if the sassy sidekick walked in wearing a gold medal that he'd won at the cake walking event at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier? Then, maybe there would have been a reasonable expectation that he would have been more skilled when carrying a ridiculously large cake. Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick, irony would have been exemplified. Another example. A senior citizen texting and blogging. The common and reasonable expectation of more mature men and women is that they don't like or know technology, that they have a hard time turning on a computer, or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s. One should not expect them to be connected, high-tech, or savvy enough to text or to be blogging, which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing that "back in my day," they never had. So when Granny pulls out her smart phone to post pictures of her dentures or her grandkids, irony ensues. Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met. That is irony. So while the cake dropper might not be ironic, there are all kinds of situations in life that are. Go out, and find those true examples of irony.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: We often confuse irony with something _____________.
Options: A. Funny, B. Coincidental, C. That's the opposite of what you expected, D. Both A and B
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: According to the transcript, what is the primary condition for a situation to be considered ironic? Options: A. The situation must be humorous or unexpected., B. The situation must involve an outcome that is the opposite of what was reasonably expected., C. The situation must be embarrassing for someone involved., D. The situation must be relatable to the audience. Correct Option: B
Question 2: What is the author's main argument about the term "irony"? Options: A. It is often used correctly in everyday conversations., B. It is a term that only applies to literature and poetry., C. It has been completely misunderstood and is often misused., D. It is a term that is only relevant in historical contexts.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options, it shares a similar intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about what irony is often confused with, while Question 2 asks about the author's main argument regarding the term "irony." However, the correct option for Question 2 (C. It has been completely misunderstood and is often misused) implies that irony is often confused with other concepts, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose a question that more closely matches the content and options of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there isn't a perfect match among the provided generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is a distant second in terms of similarity, as it deals with the concept of irony and its definition.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 1 is not the best match. A better match would be a question that asks about what irony is often confused with or a question that asks about the common misconceptions of irony.

In this case, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present among the provided options. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is a better match in terms of intent, as it asks about a situation that is often misconstrued as ironic and requires the test-taker to understand the concept of irony.

But if I really had to choose the best match from the generated MCQs, I would say that it is Question 2's intent that best matches, but since that was not the best answer I could give I re-read and among the choices I have I would pick Question 3's for a very weak intent similarity of what the Ground Truth MCQ was asking about however I read them again and in a scale from 1 to 10, 1 not similar 10 very similar I would rate my answer a 2, because there isn't any other question similar to the ground truth.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Picture this: your friend and you are watching a sitcom and a sassy sidekick walks into a room, carrying a four-tiered wedding cake. He trips, falls, and face-plants into the cake. Your friend doubles over with laughter and says, "It's so ridiculous! So ironic!" Well, quick, what do you do? Do you laugh along with the laugh track and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go? Or, do you throw caution to the wind and explain the true meaning of irony? If you're me, you choose the latter. Unfortunately, irony has been completely misunderstood. We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny or coincidental. And while many examples of true irony can be funny, that is not the driving factor of being ironic. A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact opposite of what was expected. If you expect A, but get B, then you have irony. Let's take the slap-stick cake situation as an example. When someone walks in precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone, trips, falls, and makes a mess, it is funny, but it's not ironic. In fact, you probably expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip. When he does, reality aligns with expectations, and so that is not irony. But what if the sassy sidekick walked in wearing a gold medal that he'd won at the cake walking event at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier? Then, maybe there would have been a reasonable expectation that he would have been more skilled when carrying a ridiculously large cake. Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick, irony would have been exemplified. Another example. A senior citizen texting and blogging. The common and reasonable expectation of more mature men and women is that they don't like or know technology, that they have a hard time turning on a computer, or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s. One should not expect them to be connected, high-tech, or savvy enough to text or to be blogging, which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing that "back in my day," they never had. So when Granny pulls out her smart phone to post pictures of her dentures or her grandkids, irony ensues. Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met. That is irony. So while the cake dropper might not be ironic, there are all kinds of situations in life that are. Go out, and find those true examples of irony.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Our Earth is a collection of puzzle pieces that make up the universe. In the vast darkness of space, the universe is lit by stars, which could one day become a supernova and create all the puzzle pieces that we know today as the elements. All elements were formed and released into space by exploding stars. For centuries, humans have tried to discover what makes up the world around them. Little did they know that all the pieces they needed were right under their noses. The discovery of these pieces revolutionized our understanding of the world and allowed for the creation of what might be the greatest gift to science: the periodic table. So, where are these elements, and how do we find a means to order them? Well, believe it or not, ancient civilizations were very much aware of many elements around them, but they did not identify them as the pieces of our universe. Elements like gold, silver, and copper were easily spotted by ancient cultures, and were used for multiple purposes like jewelry and tools. Why were these elements spotted so easily? Think of the periodic table as a puzzle. The corner pieces are edges of a puzzle, are generally the easiest to find and place because they stand out with their smooth edges, and clearly don't interlock with other puzzle pieces. Like puzzle pieces, elements can be choosy on who they interact with. Some like to react with other elements, while others do not. The elements that do not interact with other elements are easy to pin-point, while the ones who like to interact with others are difficult to find. Gold, silver, and copper are some of the choosier elements so we can find them easier. So let's fast forward to the late 1600's where Hennig Brand, a German alchemist, was busy working in his laboratory. Like many other alchemists of his time, Brand was trying to extract gold from the human body. Brand hit upon what he thought was the most obvious answer to his problem: urine. Urine is gold in coloration and could perhaps have gold in it. So, Brand collected as much urine as he possibly could, much of it being his own, then he decided to boil it down in hopes of obtaining gold. So Brand boiled his, well, urine, down until he collected a paste and heated the paste to a very high temperature. Eventually smoke appeared and the material burned brightly and violently. Brand had unknowingly isolated phosphorous from his urine. It was the first time anyone had discovered an element, but he didn't really understand what he had done. At the time of Brand, the concept of element had not been discovered. Instead ancient Greek principles of objects being composed of earth, water, air, and fire were predominant. It wasn't until the work of Antoine Lavoisier, who is now known as the father of chemistry, that science defined what an element was. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down by existing chemical means. Lavoisier created a list of the known elements of his time and tried to put the elements in some sort of order in which they could be classified, such as gases or metals. He was the first one to try to put the puzzle together. This was just the beginning of a means to organize the known elements of his time. Many other chemists then came along to make the puzzle clearer. One of them, John Dalton, weighed the elements and arranged the puzzle by weight. German chemist Wolfgang Döbereiner later combined elements to see how they reacted with one another. What he found was that certain elements shared similar properties and reactions. For example, when pure lithium, sodium, and potassium are exposed to water, they will react violently and skid across the surface of the water with sparks. The scientists then realized that these similiarities are no coincidence: elements belong to families that share similar properties. But the chemist who finally put the puzzle together is Dmitri Mendeleev. He created cards of each known element and tried to order them based on atomic weight and their known properties. The story is that he stayed up 3 days and 3 nights, and he finally fell into a deep sleep and he dreamed about a table to order the elements. Mendeleev was not only able to create the periodic table, but he was able to predict elements that were not yet discovered. The puzzle of the periodic table of the elements was solved.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask which element was not easily spotted by ancient cultures, it provides insight into why certain elements like gold, silver, and copper were easily identified. This information can be used to infer that elements that are highly reactive or do not have unique properties might not have been easily spotted by ancient cultures.

However, a more direct match is not available among the generated MCQs. If the options in Question 2 were modified to include a highly reactive or difficult-to-identify element, it would be a more direct match.

That being said, if we were to choose an index from the given options, it would be Question 2, with the understanding that it's not a perfect match but the closest one available.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What was the unexpected result of Hennig Brand boiling down urine in his laboratory? However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar question is Question 3: What was Hennig Brand trying to extract from the human body in the late 1600s? However, the options provided in this question do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, the closest match would be a question that asks what Hennig Brand used to try to find gold, which is not explicitly present in the generated MCQs. However, Question 3 is the closest in terms of content.

But a more accurate match is not present, a more similar question could be a combination of Question 3 and Question 4. However, if I had to choose one from the existing questions, I would choose Question 3.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Our Earth is a collection of puzzle pieces that make up the universe. In the vast darkness of space, the universe is lit by stars, which could one day become a supernova and create all the puzzle pieces that we know today as the elements. All elements were formed and released into space by exploding stars. For centuries, humans have tried to discover what makes up the world around them. Little did they know that all the pieces they needed were right under their noses. The discovery of these pieces revolutionized our understanding of the world and allowed for the creation of what might be the greatest gift to science: the periodic table. So, where are these elements, and how do we find a means to order them? Well, believe it or not, ancient civilizations were very much aware of many elements around them, but they did not identify them as the pieces of our universe. Elements like gold, silver, and copper were easily spotted by ancient cultures, and were used for multiple purposes like jewelry and tools. Why were these elements spotted so easily? Think of the periodic table as a puzzle. The corner pieces are edges of a puzzle, are generally the easiest to find and place because they stand out with their smooth edges, and clearly don't interlock with other puzzle pieces. Like puzzle pieces, elements can be choosy on who they interact with. Some like to react with other elements, while others do not. The elements that do not interact with other elements are easy to pin-point, while the ones who like to interact with others are difficult to find. Gold, silver, and copper are some of the choosier elements so we can find them easier. So let's fast forward to the late 1600's where Hennig Brand, a German alchemist, was busy working in his laboratory. Like many other alchemists of his time, Brand was trying to extract gold from the human body. Brand hit upon what he thought was the most obvious answer to his problem: urine. Urine is gold in coloration and could perhaps have gold in it. So, Brand collected as much urine as he possibly could, much of it being his own, then he decided to boil it down in hopes of obtaining gold. So Brand boiled his, well, urine, down until he collected a paste and heated the paste to a very high temperature. Eventually smoke appeared and the material burned brightly and violently. Brand had unknowingly isolated phosphorous from his urine. It was the first time anyone had discovered an element, but he didn't really understand what he had done. At the time of Brand, the concept of element had not been discovered. Instead ancient Greek principles of objects being composed of earth, water, air, and fire were predominant. It wasn't until the work of Antoine Lavoisier, who is now known as the father of chemistry, that science defined what an element was. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down by existing chemical means. Lavoisier created a list of the known elements of his time and tried to put the elements in some sort of order in which they could be classified, such as gases or metals. He was the first one to try to put the puzzle together. This was just the beginning of a means to organize the known elements of his time. Many other chemists then came along to make the puzzle clearer. One of them, John Dalton, weighed the elements and arranged the puzzle by weight. German chemist Wolfgang Döbereiner later combined elements to see how they reacted with one another. What he found was that certain elements shared similar properties and reactions. For example, when pure lithium, sodium, and potassium are exposed to water, they will react violently and skid across the surface of the water with sparks. The scientists then realized that these similiarities are no coincidence: elements belong to families that share similar properties. But the chemist who finally put the puzzle together is Dmitri Mendeleev. He created cards of each known element and tried to order them based on atomic weight and their known properties. The story is that he stayed up 3 days and 3 nights, and he finally fell into a deep sleep and he dreamed about a table to order the elements. Mendeleev was not only able to create the periodic table, but he was able to predict elements that were not yet discovered. The puzzle of the periodic table of the elements was solved.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What is a cartoon really? Many of us love cartoons, most of us grew up reading them or having them read to us. The fact is, cartoons have been around a long time. There are all kinds of cartoons: strip comics, comic books, political cartoons, single-panel cartoons, graphic novels, web comics, animation, caricature, there is something for everyone. No matter the form them come in, cartoons elicit all kinds of emotions from the viewer - happiness, sadness, anger, hilarity, calm - and can transmit ideas in an instant. Cartoons are a universal medium enjoyed and understood around the world and across borders. This is why they have survived so long as an art form. But how can a medium that is on the surface so simple have so much influence and at times be so meaningful? Let's look at what a cartoon is. It starts with an idea. The idea can be verbal, written in words, or it can be visual. A visual idea is simply a picture, a drawing, a doodle. These ideas come from a variety of places. Cartoonists might find the idea from observing life, reading a newspaper, trawling online. It can come from a sentence someone said or a single word heard on television. Cartoonists are like sponges; they soak up people, places, mannerisms, clothing, and behavior. Sometimes they might jot them down in a little black book that they carry around with them. Other times, it is just soaked up into the cartoonist's brain only to be squeezed out later when she is sitting at her drawing table. Not only does a cartoonist have to be aware of what she is seeing visually, but she has to listen to herself think. In other words, take the incoming information and select it, shape it, and then use it for a cartoon. Now that you have an idea, or something you think could be good for a cartoon, it's time to shape it. A cartoon is like a staged play. A cartoonist is playwright, director, stage designer, choreographer, and costume designer. A cartoon has characters, a set, dialogue, even if one line, and a backstory. The characters must be dressed to fit the idea, speak in a way that is natural and forwards the idea or gives the punchline. Nothing should be in the cartoon that is not absolutely necessary for the advancement of the idea. The image and words have to dance together in a way that makes sense. It could be a graceful dance, or an awkward dance, if that is part of the humor or idea. And then the execution. Some cartoonists sketch the idea with pencil then ink it with pen using a light box. Others visualize the image in their head and draw directly on the paper in pen. Different kinds of pens are used: felt-tip, mechanical pen, or a crow quill. Paper can be light-weight or heavy-bond. Many cartoonists add gray tone, called a wash, by using black watercolor and a brush. Others use a soft pencil for the tone. Color is usually created by using watercolor. A finished cartoon can then be scanned and adjusted, and the caption can be added on the computer with Photoshop. New technologies are emerging for the cartoonist's use in creating her cartoon. Photoshop can serve as a tool for color and image. Some may draw directly on a tablet with a stylus. The choices at this stage of creation work in tandem with the idea, and often when the final caption is added, it gets adjusted yet again. But, little is left to chance, except, perhaps, some of the watercolor. All these elements function in concert with one another. It's almost like a dance of words, ideas, and images that work together in order to make the cartoon a timeless, resilient work of art.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What is a cartoon really? Many of us love cartoons, most of us grew up reading them or having them read to us. The fact is, cartoons have been around a long time. There are all kinds of cartoons: strip comics, comic books, political cartoons, single-panel cartoons, graphic novels, web comics, animation, caricature, there is something for everyone. No matter the form them come in, cartoons elicit all kinds of emotions from the viewer - happiness, sadness, anger, hilarity, calm - and can transmit ideas in an instant. Cartoons are a universal medium enjoyed and understood around the world and across borders. This is why they have survived so long as an art form. But how can a medium that is on the surface so simple have so much influence and at times be so meaningful? Let's look at what a cartoon is. It starts with an idea. The idea can be verbal, written in words, or it can be visual. A visual idea is simply a picture, a drawing, a doodle. These ideas come from a variety of places. Cartoonists might find the idea from observing life, reading a newspaper, trawling online. It can come from a sentence someone said or a single word heard on television. Cartoonists are like sponges; they soak up people, places, mannerisms, clothing, and behavior. Sometimes they might jot them down in a little black book that they carry around with them. Other times, it is just soaked up into the cartoonist's brain only to be squeezed out later when she is sitting at her drawing table. Not only does a cartoonist have to be aware of what she is seeing visually, but she has to listen to herself think. In other words, take the incoming information and select it, shape it, and then use it for a cartoon. Now that you have an idea, or something you think could be good for a cartoon, it's time to shape it. A cartoon is like a staged play. A cartoonist is playwright, director, stage designer, choreographer, and costume designer. A cartoon has characters, a set, dialogue, even if one line, and a backstory. The characters must be dressed to fit the idea, speak in a way that is natural and forwards the idea or gives the punchline. Nothing should be in the cartoon that is not absolutely necessary for the advancement of the idea. The image and words have to dance together in a way that makes sense. It could be a graceful dance, or an awkward dance, if that is part of the humor or idea. And then the execution. Some cartoonists sketch the idea with pencil then ink it with pen using a light box. Others visualize the image in their head and draw directly on the paper in pen. Different kinds of pens are used: felt-tip, mechanical pen, or a crow quill. Paper can be light-weight or heavy-bond. Many cartoonists add gray tone, called a wash, by using black watercolor and a brush. Others use a soft pencil for the tone. Color is usually created by using watercolor. A finished cartoon can then be scanned and adjusted, and the caption can be added on the computer with Photoshop. New technologies are emerging for the cartoonist's use in creating her cartoon. Photoshop can serve as a tool for color and image. Some may draw directly on a tablet with a stylus. The choices at this stage of creation work in tandem with the idea, and often when the final caption is added, it gets adjusted yet again. But, little is left to chance, except, perhaps, some of the watercolor. All these elements function in concert with one another. It's almost like a dance of words, ideas, and images that work together in order to make the cartoon a timeless, resilient work of art.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of identifying the characteristics or examples of a cartoon, I would choose Question 2. But since it doesn't have an option that says "which of the following is not an example of a cartoon", it's not a perfect match.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be one that asks to identify which option is not an example of a cartoon. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this intent exactly.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but it's not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent. 

If I had to choose one from the existing generated MCQs, I would say:

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, the intent and content of Question 9 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the most important element to carry through from start to finish in creating a cartoon, and the correct answer is "the idea." Question 9 asks about the relationship between the various elements of a cartoon and how they work together. The correct answer, "They function in concert with one another, working together to create the cartoon," implies that all elements, including the idea, are crucial and work together to create a cohesive cartoon. However, among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest match in terms of discussing the importance of different elements in creating a cartoon.

A more direct match would be a question that explicitly asks about the most important element in creating a cartoon. However, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It is only in the last 100 or so years that human kind has understood that the nucleus of the chemical elements is not always fixed. It can change spontaneously from one element to another. The name for this process is radioactivity. You probably already know something about the nucleus: it's much tinier than the atom, it's made of particles called protons and neutrons, there are electrons orbiting around it. And though the atoms can share or swap electrons when they bond together, the nuclei themselves never change. Right? Well, no. Certain nuclei are not stable in that way. This means they may change suddenly, spontaneously. The radioactive nucleus flings out a small particle and transforms into another element, just like that. For example, the carbon nucleus can eject a fast-moving electron and turn into a nitrogen nucleus. There are two different particles that can be emitted from radioactive nuclei, but never together. The very fast electron is known as a beta particle. If you know a little bit about electrons, you may be thinking, "What was the electron doing in the nucleus in the first place?" The answer is there is a neutron in nucleus spontaneously changed into a proton, which stayed behind, and the electron flew out as a beta particle. This is not what chemistry has taught us to expect. The nucleus is supposed to be stable. Neutrons don't change into protons. Except, sometimes they do! The other particle it emits spontaneously from an unstable nucleus is alpha. An alpha particle is 8,000 times more massive than beta, and it's a bit slower. Alpha is made from two protons and two neutrons. If we trap all those alpha particles together, we get helium gas. Alpha is a helium nucleus. Like the beta particle, you would not have expected a heavier nucleus to throw out helium. But again, it happens, and the nucleus becomes a new element. So, is radioactivity useful or just dangerous? Wherever you are sitting, it is quite likely that there is a device nearby which contains a source of alpha particles: a smoke detector. The source is radioactive Americium. You are totally safe from these alpha particles, which cannot travel more than a few centimeters in air. Beta particles penetrate much farther through materials than alpha can. Radioactive atoms are used in medicine as traces, to show where chemicals travel in the patient. Beta particles are emitted and have enough energy to emerge from the body and be detected. There is a third type of nuclear radiation: gamma, which is not a particle at all. It is an electromagnetic wave, like microwaves, or light, but it is actually 1,000 times more energentic than visible light. Gamma rays may pass right through your body. Gamma is used to zap the bacteria in fruit to increase its shelf life, or in radiotherapy to kill cancer cells. Radioactive substances get hot, and this heat can be used to generate power. This heat has been brought to you since space probes, and, in the past, in pacemakers for hearts. The more abruptly nuclear radiation is slowed down, the more damage it does to the atoms it hits. This is called ionization. Alpha causes the most ionization as it crashes into other atoms and gamma the least. In humans, the most serious effect of radiation is the damage that it can cause to our DNA. Although alpha cannot penetrate your skin, if you inhale or injest a radioactive nucleus, the health consequences can be severe. Radioactivity is both useful and deadly, but it is all around us as a background to the natural world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2, but it doesn't match perfectly. However, another question provides a better match for the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match is not found in the first few questions, but when looking at the rest of the questions, none directly ask about the properties of alpha radiation in a manner that matches the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 5 and the information provided in Question 6 provide hints about the properties of alpha radiation but do not directly address the question.

However, Question 6 provides information about beta particles and Question 5 provides a comparison of the penetrating power of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, which is somewhat related to ionization.

Upon closer inspection, Question 2 does describe the composition of an alpha particle but does not address the other properties mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, looking at the provided generated MCQs again, Question 5 is the closest in terms of the physical properties of the radiation types, which is somewhat related to the ionization power of alpha radiation.

So the closest generated MCQ that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ would be Question 5 or Question 2, but they do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, between the two, Question 5 provides a better match for the intent of the properties of radiation types.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about gamma radiation, it does ask about the penetrating power of gamma radiation, which is related to the fact that gamma radiation travels at the speed of light (as an electromagnetic wave). However, a more direct match is not available among the generated MCQs.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the characteristics of gamma radiation, such as its speed or composition. However, since such a question is not available, Question 5 is the closest match.

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on the general topic of radioactivity and its applications, rather than the specific characteristics of gamma radiation.

For example, the carbon nucleus can eject a fast-moving electron and turn into a nitrogen nucleus. There are two different particles that can be emitted from radioactive nuclei, but never together. The very fast electron is known as a beta particle. If you know a little bit about electrons, you may be thinking, "What was the electron doing in the nucleus in the first place?" The answer is there is a neutron in nucleus spontaneously changed into a proton, which stayed behind, and the electron flew out as a beta particle. This is not what chemistry has taught us to expect. The nucleus is supposed to be stable. Neutrons don't change into protons. Except, sometimes they do! The other particle it emits spontaneously from an unstable nucleus is alpha. An alpha particle is 8,000 times more massive than beta, and it's a bit slower. Alpha is made from two protons and two neutrons. If we trap all those alpha particles together, we get helium gas. Alpha is a helium nucleus. Like the beta particle, you would not have expected a heavier nucleus to throw out helium. But again, it happens, and the nucleus becomes a new element. So, is radioactivity useful or just dangerous? Wherever you are sitting, it is quite likely that there is a device nearby which contains a source of alpha particles: a smoke detector. The source is radioactive Americium. You are totally safe from these alpha particles, which cannot travel more than a few centimeters in air. Beta particles penetrate much farther through materials than alpha can. Radioactive atoms are used in medicine as traces, to show where chemicals travel in the patient. Beta particles are emitted and have enough energy to emerge from the body and be detected. There is a third type of nuclear radiation: gamma, which is not a particle at all. It is an electromagnetic wave, like microwaves, or light, but it is actually 1,000 times more energentic than visible light. Gamma rays may pass right through your body. Gamma is used to zap the bacteria in fruit to increase its shelf life, or in radiotherapy to kill cancer cells. Radioactive substances get hot, and this heat can be used to generate power. This heat has been brought to you since space probes, and, in the past, in pacemakers for hearts. The more abruptly nuclear radiation is slowed down, the more damage it does to the atoms it hits. This is called ionization. Alpha causes the most ionization as it crashes into other atoms and gamma the least. In humans, the most serious effect of radiation is the damage that it can cause to our DNA. Although alpha cannot penetrate your skin, if you inhale or injest a radioactive nucleus, the health consequences can be severe. Radioactivity is both useful and deadly, but it is all around us as a background to the natural world.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Pretty much everyone loves eating pizza, but it can be a messy business. Pizza is soft and bendable. So how can you stop
all that cheese from falling off? You might know some tricks: you can use two hands --
not so classy, or you can use a paper plate and allow only the tip
of the pizza to peek out. There's one other trick, though: holding the crust, you can sort
of fold the slice down the middle. Now the tip of the pizza
isn't falling over, and you can eat it without getting
tomato sauce all over yourself or accidentally biting off
some of that paper plate. But why should the tip stay up
just because you bent the crust? To understand this,
you need to know two things: a little bit about the math
of curved shapes and a little about the physics
of thin sheets. First, the math. Suppose I have a flat sheet
made out of rubber. It's really thin and bendable,
so it's easy to roll into a cylinder. I don't need to stretch
the sheet at all, just bend it. This property where one shape
can be transformed into another without stretching or crumpling,
is called isometry. A mathematician would say that a flat
sheet is isometric to a cylinder. But not all shapes are isometric. If I try to turn my flat sheet
into part of a sphere, there's no way I can do it. You can check this for yourself, by trying to fit a flat sheet
of paper onto a soccer ball without stretching or crumpling the paper. It's just not possible. So a mathematician would say that a flat sheet and a sphere
aren't isometric. There's one more familiar
shape that isn't isometric to any of the shapes we've seen
so far: a potato chip. Potato chip shapes
aren't isometric to flat sheets. If you want to get a flat piece of rubber
into the shape of a potato chip, you need to stretch it --
not just bend it, but stretch it as well. So, that's the math. Not so hard, right? Now for the physics. It can be summed up in one sentence: Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. This is really important. Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. Remember when we rolled
our flat sheet of rubber into a cylinder? That wasn't hard, right? But imagine how hard
you'd have pull on the sheet to increase its area by 10 percent. It would be pretty difficult. The point is that bending a thin sheet takes a relatively small amount of force, but stretching or crumbling
a thin sheet is much harder. Now, finally, we get to talk about pizza. Suppose you go down to the pizzeria
and buy yourself a slice. You pick it up from the crust,
first, without doing the fold. Because of gravity,
the slice bends downwards. Pizza is pretty thin, after all, and we know that thin sheets
are easy to bend. You can't get it in your mouth, cheese and tomato sauce dripping
everywhere -- it's a big mess. So you fold the crust. When you do, you force the pizza
into something like a taco shape. That's not hard to do --
after all, this shape is isometric to the original pizza, which was flat. But imagine what would happen
if the pizza were to droop down while you're bending it. Now it looks like a droopy taco. And what does a droopy taco
look like? A potato chip! But we know that potato chips are not
isometric to flat pieces of rubber or flat pizzas, and that means that in order
to get into the shape it's in now, the slice of pizza had to stretch. Since the pizza is thin,
this takes a lot of force, compared to the amount of force it takes to bend the pizza in the first place. So, what's the conclusion? When you fold the pizza at the crust, you make it into a shape where a lot
of force is needed to bend the tip down. Often gravity isn't strong enough
to provide this force. That was kind of a lot of information, so let's do a quick backwards recap. When pizza is folded at the crust, gravity isn't strong enough
to bend the tip. Why? Because stretching a pizza is hard. And to bend the tip downwards,
the pizza would have to stretch, because the shape the pizza would be in, the droopy taco shape, isn't isometric
to the original flat pizza. Why? Because of math. As the pizza example shows,
we can learn a lot by looking at the mathematical properties
of different shapes. And it's especially nice when those shapes
happen to be pizza slices.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Pretty much everyone loves eating pizza, but it can be a messy business. Pizza is soft and bendable. So how can you stop
all that cheese from falling off? You might know some tricks: you can use two hands --
not so classy, or you can use a paper plate and allow only the tip
of the pizza to peek out. There's one other trick, though: holding the crust, you can sort
of fold the slice down the middle. Now the tip of the pizza
isn't falling over, and you can eat it without getting
tomato sauce all over yourself or accidentally biting off
some of that paper plate. But why should the tip stay up
just because you bent the crust? To understand this,
you need to know two things: a little bit about the math
of curved shapes and a little about the physics
of thin sheets. First, the math. Suppose I have a flat sheet
made out of rubber. It's really thin and bendable,
so it's easy to roll into a cylinder. I don't need to stretch
the sheet at all, just bend it. This property where one shape
can be transformed into another without stretching or crumpling,
is called isometry. A mathematician would say that a flat
sheet is isometric to a cylinder. But not all shapes are isometric. If I try to turn my flat sheet
into part of a sphere, there's no way I can do it. You can check this for yourself, by trying to fit a flat sheet
of paper onto a soccer ball without stretching or crumpling the paper. It's just not possible. So a mathematician would say that a flat sheet and a sphere
aren't isometric. There's one more familiar
shape that isn't isometric to any of the shapes we've seen
so far: a potato chip. Potato chip shapes
aren't isometric to flat sheets. If you want to get a flat piece of rubber
into the shape of a potato chip, you need to stretch it --
not just bend it, but stretch it as well. So, that's the math. Not so hard, right? Now for the physics. It can be summed up in one sentence: Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. This is really important. Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. Remember when we rolled
our flat sheet of rubber into a cylinder? That wasn't hard, right? But imagine how hard
you'd have pull on the sheet to increase its area by 10 percent. It would be pretty difficult. The point is that bending a thin sheet takes a relatively small amount of force, but stretching or crumbling
a thin sheet is much harder. Now, finally, we get to talk about pizza. Suppose you go down to the pizzeria
and buy yourself a slice. You pick it up from the crust,
first, without doing the fold. Because of gravity,
the slice bends downwards. Pizza is pretty thin, after all, and we know that thin sheets
are easy to bend. You can't get it in your mouth, cheese and tomato sauce dripping
everywhere -- it's a big mess. So you fold the crust. When you do, you force the pizza
into something like a taco shape. That's not hard to do --
after all, this shape is isometric to the original pizza, which was flat. But imagine what would happen
if the pizza were to droop down while you're bending it. Now it looks like a droopy taco. And what does a droopy taco
look like? A potato chip! But we know that potato chips are not
isometric to flat pieces of rubber or flat pizzas, and that means that in order
to get into the shape it's in now, the slice of pizza had to stretch. Since the pizza is thin,
this takes a lot of force, compared to the amount of force it takes to bend the pizza in the first place. So, what's the conclusion? When you fold the pizza at the crust, you make it into a shape where a lot
of force is needed to bend the tip down. Often gravity isn't strong enough
to provide this force. That was kind of a lot of information, so let's do a quick backwards recap. When pizza is folded at the crust, gravity isn't strong enough
to bend the tip. Why? Because stretching a pizza is hard. And to bend the tip downwards,
the pizza would have to stretch, because the shape the pizza would be in, the droopy taco shape, isn't isometric
to the original flat pizza. Why? Because of math. As the pizza example shows,
we can learn a lot by looking at the mathematical properties
of different shapes. And it's especially nice when those shapes
happen to be pizza slices.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the limitations of the simplified model presented in the talk, specifically what factors might be included to make the model more accurate.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest in terms of discussing the behavior of the pizza when folded, but it doesn't address the limitations of the model.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4. This question discusses the physics concept that explains why thin sheets are easy to bend but hard to stretch, which is related to the behavior of the pizza when folded. Nevertheless, it doesn't address the limitations of the model.

Since none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that specifically addresses the limitations of the simplified model presented in the talk.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 4 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level.

Index: 4 (with low confidence)

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We all start life as one single cell. Then that cell divides and we are two cells, then four, then eight. Cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form us. These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell to 100 trillion cells, are called growth. And growth seems like a simple thing because when we think of it, we typically think of someone getting taller or, later in life, wider, but to cells, growth isn't simple. Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that's part individual, part community-driven. And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells, some times things go wrong. Maybe an individual cell's set of instructions, or DNA, gets a typo, what we call a mutation. Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes and shuts itself down, or the system detects a troublemaker and eliminates it. But, enough mutations can bypass the fail-safes, driving the cell to divide recklessly. That one rogue cell becomes two, then four, then eight. At every stage, the incorrect instructions are passed along to the cells' offspring. Weeks, months, or years after that one rogue cell transformed, you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast. Difficulty going to the bathroom could reveal a problem in your intestine, prostate, or bladder. Or, a routine blood test might count too many white cells or elevated liver enzymes. Your doctor delivers the bad news: it's cancer. From here your strategy will depend on where the cancer is and how far it's progressed. If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place, surgery might be all you need, if anything. If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue, your doctor might recommend radiation or surgery followed by radiation. If the cancer has spread, or if it's inherently everywhere like a leukemia, your doctor will most likely recommend chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemo. Radiation and most forms of chemo work by physically shredding the cells' DNA or disrupting the copying machinery. But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells. Radiation hits whatever you point it at, and your blood stream carries chemo-therapeutics all over your body. So, what happens when different cells get hit? Let's look at a healthy liver cell, a healthy hair cell, and a cancerous cell. The healthy liver cell divides only when it is stressed; the healthy hair cell divides frequently; and the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. When you take a chemotherapeutic drug, it will hit all of these cells. And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division. So, every time a cell divides, it opens itself up to attack, and that means the more frequently a cell divides, the more likely the drug is to kill it. So, remember that hair cell? It divides frequently and isn't a threat. And, there are other frequently dividing cells in your body like skin cells, gut cells, and blood cells. So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallels these tissue types: hair loss, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, and pain. That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest. So, in the end, it is all about growth. Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery and forces them to put the pedal to the metal, growing rapidly and recklessly. But, using chemotherapeutic drugs, we take advantage of that aggressiveness, and we turn cancer's main strength into a weakness.

It divides frequently and isn't a threat. And, there are other frequently dividing cells in your body like skin cells, gut cells, and blood cells. So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallels these tissue types: hair loss, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, and pain. That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest. So, in the end, it is all about growth. Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery and forces them to put the pedal to the metal, growing rapidly and recklessly. But, using chemotherapeutic drugs, we take advantage of that aggressiveness, and we turn cancer's main strength into a weakness.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about a treatment option that is NOT recommended.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 7 is also not a perfect match, but it does provide a clue. Question 7 asks about the recommended treatment for leukemia, and one of the options is "Surgery." Considering the context of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about a routine treatment that is NOT recommended, I noticed that the transcript mentions that surgery might be all that is needed for slow-growing tumors in one location. However, for leukemia, the transcript suggests that chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemotherapy is more likely to be recommended.

Given the available options, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the context and the options provided, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, although it does not directly ask about a treatment that is NOT recommended.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, but with the caveat that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 7 (with reservations)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically address the question of which treatment is NOT recommended.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We all start life as one single cell. Then that cell divides and we are two cells, then four, then eight. Cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form us. These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell to 100 trillion cells, are called growth. And growth seems like a simple thing because when we think of it, we typically think of someone getting taller or, later in life, wider, but to cells, growth isn't simple. Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that's part individual, part community-driven. And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells, some times things go wrong. Maybe an individual cell's set of instructions, or DNA, gets a typo, what we call a mutation. Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes and shuts itself down, or the system detects a troublemaker and eliminates it. But, enough mutations can bypass the fail-safes, driving the cell to divide recklessly. That one rogue cell becomes two, then four, then eight. At every stage, the incorrect instructions are passed along to the cells' offspring. Weeks, months, or years after that one rogue cell transformed, you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast. Difficulty going to the bathroom could reveal a problem in your intestine, prostate, or bladder. Or, a routine blood test might count too many white cells or elevated liver enzymes. Your doctor delivers the bad news: it's cancer. From here your strategy will depend on where the cancer is and how far it's progressed. If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place, surgery might be all you need, if anything. If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue, your doctor might recommend radiation or surgery followed by radiation. If the cancer has spread, or if it's inherently everywhere like a leukemia, your doctor will most likely recommend chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemo. Radiation and most forms of chemo work by physically shredding the cells' DNA or disrupting the copying machinery. But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells. Radiation hits whatever you point it at, and your blood stream carries chemo-therapeutics all over your body. So, what happens when different cells get hit? Let's look at a healthy liver cell, a healthy hair cell, and a cancerous cell. The healthy liver cell divides only when it is stressed; the healthy hair cell divides frequently; and the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. When you take a chemotherapeutic drug, it will hit all of these cells. And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division. So, every time a cell divides, it opens itself up to attack, and that means the more frequently a cell divides, the more likely the drug is to kill it. So, remember that hair cell?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why are chemotherapeutic drugs generally successful against cancer cells?
Options: A. Chemotherapy is specifically designed to attack only cancer cells, therefore, the affects on other cells is minimal and inconsequential, B. Chemotherapy attacks only cells that appear to have a mutation (meaning that the majority of healthy body cells are unaffected, but the majority of cancer cells are eliminated), C. Chemotherapy attacks every cell in the body, but cells that divide more frequently are most susceptible (that's why cancer cells are hit the hardest -- they divide so frequently and randomly), D. Chemotherapy is not generally successful and is usually held as a last resort for patients who have exhausted other treatment options

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let's talk about the facts of life. You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid about sex or drugs with your parents or some trusted adult? Probably not because it's a myth. You don't talk to kids about that stuff. It's just so embarrassing. And, hey, maybe that's OK. We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades. We spend billions of dollars on it. So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV? I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan: "This is drugs, and this is your brain on drugs. Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff. Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol, and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined. But, nevermind, it's legal. So we declared war on drugs! Nancy Reagan was our general. All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!" Just say, "No!" to pot. Just say, "No!" to cocaine. Just say, "No!" to everything. So simple! If you want to save kids, you have to scare the hell out of them! And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that. Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex. We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS. And when all the data finally came home, guess what: completely ineffective. We love big solutions to big problems, don't we? What if the facts of life don't work that way? What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced? What if it can't be scaled up? Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it? And, many of them are really trying to help. Who, then? Us. We have to talk to kids. Openly and honestly. But are we ready to be honest? I don't think so. We mythologize childhood. Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a completely typical 1980's American suburb. For the parents, a wholesome paradise of bridge parties and tennis games. For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project, and our laboratory was in the woods after school, under the covers during sleep-overs, really, any opportunity we could take to peel off our clothes and investigate. What were these things, bodies? What do they do? We had to figure them out and that's childhood. It's not just fun and games, it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness. And then you walk into your first class in middle school, and the bomb goes off. You are not just a body any more. Oh no, now you are grotesque. That's when the suffering really starts. So, yeah, talk to kids. But if you are not honest about your own experiences first, everything you say smells like bullshit. Don't worry, you can practice and you should start by talking to the one kid you definitely know: you. What kind of kid were you? What troubled you? For me, it was age 13. That was the worst year. I was obsessively curious about sex and also deeply ashamed by it. It wasn't my only problem, of course, not by a long shot, but it was the beginning of a downward spiral. And my bad luck was to hit bottom while watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, which is a bad idea for a miserable 13-year old high on weed. So, that night, for whatever reason, it seemed like good idea to shave off my eyebrows, and then try to kill myself by swallowing all the pills in the bathroom, which was not at all fatal, but everyone noticed the eyebrows. And that made middle school extra fun. So, what was your low point? And if you could build a time machine to travel back and talk to that kid, what would you say to yourself? For me, it was easy. All I really needed was someone to reassure me that somehow I was a normal part of the universe. But I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. And yet weirdly, I fully expected a time traveler to materialize at any time because I was a geek. I didn't know if it would be my unborn son or a T-101 cyborg. But either one would be awesome! Hey, it's me, yourself from the future, in the year 2012. I have crucial information for you, but not about the future, about the past, a billion years in the past, when this planet was covered with nothing but cells and all they did was fight, eat, and divide; fight, eat, and divide. Except for one. And that's your ancestor. This cell enslaved other ones, but master and slave became one. And then those cells invented sex, and then they invented the first bodies with each cell doing a different job, some smelling, some moving, some eating. And the job of sex went to a special cell called the gamete. And those bodies became giant. The distance to the next body was vast so they had to swim. Most would be lost and die so they were mass-produced. Soon the oceans were a non-stop riot of sex and death until 500 million years ago, when the first beast crawled onto land. Land is hard because bodies are heavy. And the sun kills gametes. To keep them safe, so deep inside of a body, the mother builds a tiny ocean. Outside are events of unimaginable violence. Whole new forms of life are being created only to be wiped away. Millions of years are flashing by. But in here, it's always the same. Peace. Just peace. Maybe we will never know why, but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet, it was this one, bilaterally symmetric, warm-blooded, bigger than a mouse, smaller than a horse, 2 legs, 10 toes, no tail, big brain, language, technology, and civilization rising and falling for thousands of years. And here you are, a 13-year old human perplexed and embarrassed about sex. That's what I came here to tell you: we don't know why sex evolved nor why it persists. Why don't we just clone ourselves like all life did a billion years ago? It's so much more efficient. We would all have babies, no mates. It could be that children who are genetically different from each other are protected from disease. And that is still our best guess. So be comforted to know that even in the distant future, in the year 2012, we still don't know what sex is for. It is perplexing. You shouldn't be embarrassed by it. Sex is a beautiful puzzle. And without it, you simply would not be here. By the way, be nice to your little sister. She's your best friend. You'll see.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 1: According to the data mentioned in the transcript, what percentage of high school seniors had tried marijuana in the 1980s? Options: A. 12%, B. 26%, C. 50%, D. 92% Correct Option: C**

Although this question does not directly ask about the most commonly used substance amongst teenagers in the 1980s, it does provide information about the prevalence of marijuana use during that time period. Additionally, the transcript mentions that "over 50% of us had tried marijuana" and "92% of us were drinking alcohol", which suggests that alcohol was the most commonly used substance. 

However, there is no generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, as it provides information about the prevalence of substance use during the 1980s.

**Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1**

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let's talk about the facts of life. You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid about sex or drugs with your parents or some trusted adult? Probably not because it's a myth. You don't talk to kids about that stuff. It's just so embarrassing. And, hey, maybe that's OK. We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades. We spend billions of dollars on it. So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV? I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan: "This is drugs, and this is your brain on drugs. Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff. Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol, and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined. But, nevermind, it's legal. So we declared war on drugs! Nancy Reagan was our general. All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!" Just say, "No!" to pot. Just say, "No!" to cocaine. Just say, "No!" to everything. So simple! If you want to save kids, you have to scare the hell out of them! And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that. Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex. We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS. And when all the data finally came home, guess what: completely ineffective. We love big solutions to big problems, don't we? What if the facts of life don't work that way? What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced? What if it can't be scaled up? Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it? And, many of them are really trying to help. Who, then? Us. We have to talk to kids. Openly and honestly. But are we ready to be honest? I don't think so. We mythologize childhood. Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a completely typical 1980's American suburb. For the parents, a wholesome paradise of bridge parties and tennis games. For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project, and our laboratory was in the woods after school, under the covers during sleep-overs, really, any opportunity we could take to peel off our clothes and investigate. What were these things, bodies? What do they do? We had to figure them out and that's childhood. It's not just fun and games, it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness. And then you walk into your first class in middle school, and the bomb goes off. You are not just a body any more. Oh no, now you are grotesque. That's when the suffering really starts. So, yeah, talk to kids. But if you are not honest about your own experiences first, everything you say smells like bullshit. Don't worry, you can practice and you should start by talking to the one kid you definitely know: you. What kind of kid were you? What troubled you? For me, it was age 13. That was the worst year. I was obsessively curious about sex and also deeply ashamed by it. It wasn't my only problem, of course, not by a long shot, but it was the beginning of a downward spiral. And my bad luck was to hit bottom while watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, which is a bad idea for a miserable 13-year old high on weed. So, that night, for whatever reason, it seemed like good idea to shave off my eyebrows, and then try to kill myself by swallowing all the pills in the bathroom, which was not at all fatal, but everyone noticed the eyebrows. And that made middle school extra fun. So, what was your low point? And if you could build a time machine to travel back and talk to that kid, what would you say to yourself? For me, it was easy. All I really needed was someone to reassure me that somehow I was a normal part of the universe. But I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. And yet weirdly, I fully expected a time traveler to materialize at any time because I was a geek. I didn't know if it would be my unborn son or a T-101 cyborg. But either one would be awesome! Hey, it's me, yourself from the future, in the year 2012. I have crucial information for you, but not about the future, about the past, a billion years in the past, when this planet was covered with nothing but cells and all they did was fight, eat, and divide; fight, eat, and divide. Except for one. And that's your ancestor. This cell enslaved other ones, but master and slave became one. And then those cells invented sex, and then they invented the first bodies with each cell doing a different job, some smelling, some moving, some eating. And the job of sex went to a special cell called the gamete. And those bodies became giant. The distance to the next body was vast so they had to swim. Most would be lost and die so they were mass-produced. Soon the oceans were a non-stop riot of sex and death until 500 million years ago, when the first beast crawled onto land. Land is hard because bodies are heavy. And the sun kills gametes. To keep them safe, so deep inside of a body, the mother builds a tiny ocean. Outside are events of unimaginable violence. Whole new forms of life are being created only to be wiped away. Millions of years are flashing by. But in here, it's always the same. Peace. Just peace. Maybe we will never know why, but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet, it was this one, bilaterally symmetric, warm-blooded, bigger than a mouse, smaller than a horse, 2 legs, 10 toes, no tail, big brain, language, technology, and civilization rising and falling for thousands of years. And here you are, a 13-year old human perplexed and embarrassed about sex. That's what I came here to tell you: we don't know why sex evolved nor why it persists. Why don't we just clone ourselves like all life did a billion years ago? It's so much more efficient. We would all have babies, no mates. It could be that children who are genetically different from each other are protected from disease. And that is still our best guess. So be comforted to know that even in the distant future, in the year 2012, we still don't know what sex is for. It is perplexing. You shouldn't be embarrassed by it. Sex is a beautiful puzzle. And without it, you simply would not be here. By the way, be nice to your little sister. She's your best friend. You'll see.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What is the speaker's perspective on the evolution of sex in the context of human history?**

Although this question does not directly ask about gametes, it is related to the topic of sex and its evolution, which is the context in which gametes are discussed in the transcript. However, a more relevant question is needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about gametes, but such a question is not available in the provided options.

If I had to choose from the available options, I would say that **Question 5** is the most similar, but it's not a perfect match.

However, upon re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that **Question 8** mentions the concept of cells and genetic diversity, which is related to the concept of gametes. But again, it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose from the available options, I would say:

**Index: 5** (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

Please note that a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about gametes, which is not available in the provided options.

Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff.

For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project, and our laboratory was in the woods after school, under the covers during sleep-overs, really, any opportunity we could take to peel off our clothes and investigate. What were these things, bodies? What do they do? We had to figure them out and that's childhood. It's not just fun and games, it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness.

Maybe we will never know why, but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet, it was this one, bilaterally symmetric, warm-blooded, bigger than a mouse, smaller than a horse, 2 legs, 10 toes, no tail, big brain, language, technology, and civilization rising and falling for thousands of years. And here you are, a 13-year old human perplexed and embarrassed about sex. That's what I came here to tell you: we don't know why sex evolved nor why it persists. Why don't we just clone ourselves like all life did a billion years ago? It's so much more efficient. We would all have babies, no mates. It could be that children who are genetically different from each other are protected from disease. And that is still our best guess. So be comforted to know that even in the distant future, in the year 2012, we still don't know what sex is for. It is perplexing. You shouldn't be embarrassed by it. Sex is a beautiful puzzle. And without it, you simply would not be here. By the way, be nice to your little sister. She's your best friend. You'll see.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let's talk about the facts of life. You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid about sex or drugs with your parents or some trusted adult? Probably not because it's a myth. You don't talk to kids about that stuff. It's just so embarrassing. And, hey, maybe that's OK. We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades. We spend billions of dollars on it. So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV? I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan: "This is drugs, and this is your brain on drugs. Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff. Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol, and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined. But, nevermind, it's legal. So we declared war on drugs! Nancy Reagan was our general. All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!" Just say, "No!" to pot. Just say, "No!" to cocaine. Just say, "No!" to everything. So simple! If you want to save kids, you have to scare the hell out of them! And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that. Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex. We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS. And when all the data finally came home, guess what: completely ineffective. We love big solutions to big problems, don't we? What if the facts of life don't work that way? What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced? What if it can't be scaled up? Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it? And, many of them are really trying to help. Who, then? Us. We have to talk to kids. Openly and honestly. But are we ready to be honest? I don't think so. We mythologize childhood. Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a completely typical 1980's American suburb. For the parents, a wholesome paradise of bridge parties and tennis games. For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project, and our laboratory was in the woods after school, under the covers during sleep-overs, really, any opportunity we could take to peel off our clothes and investigate. What were these things, bodies? What do they do? We had to figure them out and that's childhood. It's not just fun and games, it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness. And then you walk into your first class in middle school, and the bomb goes off. You are not just a body any more. Oh no, now you are grotesque. That's when the suffering really starts. So, yeah, talk to kids. But if you are not honest about your own experiences first, everything you say smells like bullshit. Don't worry, you can practice and you should start by talking to the one kid you definitely know: you. What kind of kid were you? What troubled you? For me, it was age 13. That was the worst year. I was obsessively curious about sex and also deeply ashamed by it. It wasn't my only problem, of course, not by a long shot, but it was the beginning of a downward spiral. And my bad luck was to hit bottom while watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, which is a bad idea for a miserable 13-year old high on weed. So, that night, for whatever reason, it seemed like good idea to shave off my eyebrows, and then try to kill myself by swallowing all the pills in the bathroom, which was not at all fatal, but everyone noticed the eyebrows. And that made middle school extra fun. So, what was your low point? And if you could build a time machine to travel back and talk to that kid, what would you say to yourself? For me, it was easy. All I really needed was someone to reassure me that somehow I was a normal part of the universe. But I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. And yet weirdly, I fully expected a time traveler to materialize at any time because I was a geek. I didn't know if it would be my unborn son or a T-101 cyborg. But either one would be awesome! Hey, it's me, yourself from the future, in the year 2012. I have crucial information for you, but not about the future, about the past, a billion years in the past, when this planet was covered with nothing but cells and all they did was fight, eat, and divide; fight, eat, and divide. Except for one. And that's your ancestor. This cell enslaved other ones, but master and slave became one. And then those cells invented sex, and then they invented the first bodies with each cell doing a different job, some smelling, some moving, some eating. And the job of sex went to a special cell called the gamete. And those bodies became giant. The distance to the next body was vast so they had to swim. Most would be lost and die so they were mass-produced. Soon the oceans were a non-stop riot of sex and death until 500 million years ago, when the first beast crawled onto land. Land is hard because bodies are heavy. And the sun kills gametes. To keep them safe, so deep inside of a body, the mother builds a tiny ocean. Outside are events of unimaginable violence. Whole new forms of life are being created only to be wiped away. Millions of years are flashing by. But in here, it's always the same. Peace. Just peace. Maybe we will never know why, but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet, it was this one, bilaterally symmetric, warm-blooded, bigger than a mouse, smaller than a horse, 2 legs, 10 toes, no tail, big brain, language, technology, and civilization rising and falling for thousands of years.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In Physics, the concepts of work and power help us understand and explain lots of things in our universe. Let's start with work. Positive work is the energy we put into a system, and negative work is energy that is transferred out. Think of positive work as money being added to your bank account, and negative work as money taken out. In the metric system, work and energy are measured in Joules. As an example, let's take a beautiful, old, mechanical grandfather clock. We transfer energy into the clock when we turn the crank to raise the heavy metal cylinders inside the clock. When we do this, we are doing positive work, adding energy to the clock, and that energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. We can calculate the amount of work done by multiplying the force we apply times the distance over which we apply the force. To raise the metal cylinders, we need to apply a force equal to their weight. That is, equal to the force of gravity pulling downward on the cylinders. These cylinders weight 300 Newtons, which is pretty heavy, about as much as a small child, and if we lift them 1/2 meter, then we do 300 Newtons times 1/2 meter or 150 Joules of work. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred. When we say rate, we mean the amount of energy transferred per unit of time. In the metric system, power is measured in Joules per second, or Watts. The term Watt goes back to James Watt, who came up with the concept of horsepower to measure the amount of power produced by a typical work horse. James Watt was a producer of industrial steam engines, and he wanted his potential customers to be able to make comparisons between his steam engines and a familiar quanity, the power they could get from a working horse. It was such a useful idea that the metric system unit for power, the Watt, is named after James Watt. Following in James Watt's footsteps, let's compare the amount of power it takes to run this grandfather clock to the power we'd need to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. We can measure the power a person uses to wind the clock by dividing the amount of work they did by the time it took them to do it. If it takes 1 minute, or 60 seconds, to lift the weights, then they are doing 150 Joules divided by 60 seconds, or 2.5 Joules per second of work. They are adding energy to the clock in the rate of 2.5 Watts. You would need about 40 times as much to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. Before we let the clock run, the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy of the cylinders. It's like your bank account when you have just deposited money. But if we let the clock run, the cylinders slowly move downward. Energy is leaving the clock. In fact, when the cylinders get to the bottom, all the energy that we put in will have left. So how much power does the clock use? That is, how many Joules of energy per second leave the clock if it takes 5 days for the cylinders to return to their original position? We can figure this out because we already know how much work we did when we lifted the cylinders: 150 Joules. But this time, it took 5 days rather than a minute. Five days is 5 times 24 times 60 times 60 again or 432,000 seconds. So we divide the work done by the time and find the answer of about 0.00035 Joules per second, or about 0.35 milliwatts. That's a tiny amount of power. This clock uses so little power that you could run almost 300,000 clocks using the same power it takes to run one 100-Watt light bulb. That's right, you could run a clock in every house in a medium sized city with that much power. That's a pretty amazing conclusion and it took knowledge of work and power to figure it out.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In Physics, the concepts of work and power help us understand and explain lots of things in our universe. Let's start with work. Positive work is the energy we put into a system, and negative work is energy that is transferred out. Think of positive work as money being added to your bank account, and negative work as money taken out. In the metric system, work and energy are measured in Joules. As an example, let's take a beautiful, old, mechanical grandfather clock. We transfer energy into the clock when we turn the crank to raise the heavy metal cylinders inside the clock. When we do this, we are doing positive work, adding energy to the clock, and that energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. We can calculate the amount of work done by multiplying the force we apply times the distance over which we apply the force. To raise the metal cylinders, we need to apply a force equal to their weight. That is, equal to the force of gravity pulling downward on the cylinders. These cylinders weight 300 Newtons, which is pretty heavy, about as much as a small child, and if we lift them 1/2 meter, then we do 300 Newtons times 1/2 meter or 150 Joules of work. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred. When we say rate, we mean the amount of energy transferred per unit of time. In the metric system, power is measured in Joules per second, or Watts. The term Watt goes back to James Watt, who came up with the concept of horsepower to measure the amount of power produced by a typical work horse. James Watt was a producer of industrial steam engines, and he wanted his potential customers to be able to make comparisons between his steam engines and a familiar quanity, the power they could get from a working horse. It was such a useful idea that the metric system unit for power, the Watt, is named after James Watt. Following in James Watt's footsteps, let's compare the amount of power it takes to run this grandfather clock to the power we'd need to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. We can measure the power a person uses to wind the clock by dividing the amount of work they did by the time it took them to do it. If it takes 1 minute, or 60 seconds, to lift the weights, then they are doing 150 Joules divided by 60 seconds, or 2.5 Joules per second of work. They are adding energy to the clock in the rate of 2.5 Watts. You would need about 40 times as much to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. Before we let the clock run, the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy of the cylinders. It's like your bank account when you have just deposited money. But if we let the clock run, the cylinders slowly move downward. Energy is leaving the clock. In fact, when the cylinders get to the bottom, all the energy that we put in will have left. So how much power does the clock use? That is, how many Joules of energy per second leave the clock if it takes 5 days for the cylinders to return to their original position? We can figure this out because we already know how much work we did when we lifted the cylinders: 150 Joules. But this time, it took 5 days rather than a minute. Five days is 5 times 24 times 60 times 60 again or 432,000 seconds. So we divide the work done by the time and find the answer of about 0.00035 Joules per second, or about 0.35 milliwatts. That's a tiny amount of power. This clock uses so little power that you could run almost 300,000 clocks using the same power it takes to run one 100-Watt light bulb. That's right, you could run a clock in every house in a medium sized city with that much power. That's a pretty amazing conclusion and it took knowledge of work and power to figure it out.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although Question 9 does not provide the exact number of clocks that can be run using the same power as a 100-Watt light bulb, it does compare the power required to run a 100-Watt light bulb to the power required to run a grandfather clock and concludes that the clock requires significantly less power than the light bulb. This conclusion is similar to the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you're looking for a question that specifically mentions the number of clocks, then there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one based on the content and intent, I would choose Question 9.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon as you're all aware we Face difficult Economic Times I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT he was struggling to explain something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter now he confused me from the very start because light doesn't cool things down it makes it hotter it's happening right now the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintilian photons and they're moving randomly through the space near the speed of light all of them are different colors they're Rippling with different frequencies and they're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here now a laser is different it also uses photons but they're all synchronized and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful tool the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye you can use it to store massive amounts of data and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain first you trap atoms in a special bottle it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment and the atoms themselves are quite violent but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens it's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas it enters a new state of matter called a super fluid the atoms lose their individual identity and the rules from the quantum World take over and that's what gives super fluids such spooky properties for example if you shine light through a super fluid it is able to slow photons down to 60 km per hour another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle it won't stay inside a thin film will creep up the inside wall flow over the top and right out the outside now of course the moment that it does hit the outside environment and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree it immediately turns back into normal matter super fluids are of the most fragile things we've ever discovered and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people I have a PhD in molecular biology I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the more he said the less I understood because if you're trying to to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its Essence the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all I remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds I started a contest four years ago called Dance your PhD instead of explaining their research with words some scien have to explain it with Dance Now surprisingly it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don't take my word for it go on the internet and search for Dance your PhD there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research for example at the University of Minnesota there's a biomedical engineer named David ODI and he works with dancers to study how cell cells move they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up one one side it triggers the cell to expanded shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers and those fibers are constantly falling part but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same now David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place it's basically efficient brainstorming and when I visited David to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method PowerPoint and this brings me to my Modest Proposal I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy now it does depend on how you measure it of course but one estimate has put the drain at $250 million per day now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of $35,000 and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day that would indeed add up to an annual waste of hundred billion dollar of course that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations there are other costs because PowerPoint is a tool and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country's CIA it helps you to soften up your audience it distracts them with pretty pictures irrelevant data it allows you to create the illusion of confidence the illusion of Simplicity and most destructively the illusion of understanding so now my country is $15 trillion in debt our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the Arts for example our National Endowment for the Arts with its $150 million budget slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about 1 1,000th of a percent one certainly can argue with those numbers however once we eliminate Public Funding for the Arts there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods all of this could Wipe Out the savings we're hoped to make we're hoping to make in the first place I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which I hope will not be liable to the least objection once we eliminate Public Funding for the artists let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint as a test case I propose we start with American dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our healthare system rather than dancing our phds we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank it's sure to help of course some someday in the Deep future a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 2 is not the best match because it does not contain the same question intent as the ground truth MCQ.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that asks about why the speaker was confused about the experiment. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but it would need to be modified to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one of the generated MCQs as is, I would say that none of them are a good match. However, I can try to provide a modified version of Question 1 that would match the ground truth MCQ:

Modified Question 1: Why was the speaker initially confused about the experiment that used lasers to cool down matter?
Options: A. Lasers are incredibly hot, B. Light doesn't cool things down, C. The temperature of matter doesn't depend on light, D. The speaker doesn't understand science

In this case, the modified Question 1 would be the best match. However, since I need to provide the index of one of the original generated MCQs, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but keep in mind that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon as you're all aware we Face difficult Economic Times I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT he was struggling to explain something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter now he confused me from the very start because light doesn't cool things down it makes it hotter it's happening right now the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintilian photons and they're moving randomly through the space near the speed of light all of them are different colors they're Rippling with different frequencies and they're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here now a laser is different it also uses photons but they're all synchronized and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful tool the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye you can use it to store massive amounts of data and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain first you trap atoms in a special bottle it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment and the atoms themselves are quite violent but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens it's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas it enters a new state of matter called a super fluid the atoms lose their individual identity and the rules from the quantum World take over and that's what gives super fluids such spooky properties for example if you shine light through a super fluid it is able to slow photons down to 60 km per hour another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle it won't stay inside a thin film will creep up the inside wall flow over the top and right out the outside now of course the moment that it does hit the outside environment and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree it immediately turns back into normal matter super fluids are of the most fragile things we've ever discovered and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people I have a PhD in molecular biology I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the more he said the less I understood because if you're trying to to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its Essence the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all I remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds I started a contest four years ago called Dance your PhD instead of explaining their research with words some scien have to explain it with Dance Now surprisingly it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don't take my word for it go on the internet and search for Dance your PhD there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research for example at the University of Minnesota there's a biomedical engineer named David ODI and he works with dancers to study how cell cells move they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up one one side it triggers the cell to expanded shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers and those fibers are constantly falling part but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach

to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the Arts for example our National Endowment for the Arts with its $150 million budget slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about 1 1,000th of a percent one certainly can argue with those numbers however once we eliminate Public Funding for the Arts there will be some drawbacks the artists on the

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon as you're all aware we Face difficult Economic Times I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT he was struggling to explain something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter now he confused me from the very start because light doesn't cool things down it makes it hotter it's happening right now the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintilian photons and they're moving randomly through the space near the speed of light all of them are different colors they're Rippling with different frequencies and they're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here now a laser is different it also uses photons but they're all synchronized and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful tool the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye you can use it to store massive amounts of data and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain first you trap atoms in a special bottle it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment and the atoms themselves are quite violent but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens it's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas it enters a new state of matter called a super fluid the atoms lose their individual identity and the rules from the quantum World take over and that's what gives super fluids such spooky properties for example if you shine light through a super fluid it is able to slow photons down to 60 km per hour another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle it won't stay inside a thin film will creep up the inside wall flow over the top and right out the outside now of course the moment that it does hit the outside environment and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree it immediately turns back into normal matter super fluids are of the most fragile things we've ever discovered and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people I have a PhD in molecular biology I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the more he said the less I understood because if you're trying to to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its Essence the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all I remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds I started a contest four years ago called Dance your PhD instead of explaining their research with words some scien have to explain it with Dance Now surprisingly it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don't take my word for it go on the internet and search for Dance your PhD there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research for example at the University of Minnesota there's a biomedical engineer named David ODI and he works with dancers to study how cell cells move they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up one one side it triggers the cell to expanded shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers and those fibers are constantly falling part but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same now David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place it's basically efficient brainstorming and when I visited David to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method PowerPoint and this brings me to my Modest Proposal I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy now it does depend on how

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I am going to start with a challenge. I want you to imagine each of these two scenes in as much detail as you can. Scene number one: "They gave us a hearty welcome." Well, who are the people who are giving a hearty welcome? What are they wearing? What are they drinking? OK, scene two: "They gave us a cordial reception." How are these people standing? What expressions are on their faces? What are they wearing and drinking? Fix these pictures in your mind's eye and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them. We'll come back to them later. Now on to our story. In the year 400 C.E. the Celts in Britain were ruled by Romans. This had one benefit for the Celts: the Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes of Northern Europe. But then the Roman Empire began to crumble, and the Romans withdrew from Britain. With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water, did away with the Celts, and formed kingdoms in the British Isles. For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon, became the common language, what we call Old English. Although modern English speakers may think Old English sounds like a different language, if you look and listen closely, you'll find many words that are recognizable. For example, here is what the Lord's Prayer looks like in Old English. At first glance, it may look unfamiliar, but update the spelling a bit, and you'll see many common English words. So the centuries passed with Britains happily speaking Old English, but in the 700's, a series of Viking invasions began, which continued until a treaty split the island in half. On one side were the Saxons. On the other side were the Danes who spoke a language called Old Norse. As Saxons fell in love with their cute Danish neighbors and marriages blurred the boundaries, Old Norse mixed with Old English, and many Old Norse words like freckle, leg, root, skin, and want are still a part of our language. 300 years later, in 1066, the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles. The Normans were Vikings who settled in France. They had abandoned the Viking language and culture in favor of a French lifestyle, but they still fought like Vikings. They placed a Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty. Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-speaking aristocracy and Old English-speaking peasants. The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them who added Latin words to the mix. Old English adapted and grew as thousands of words flowed in, many having to do with government, law, and aristocracy. Words like council, marriage, sovereign, govern, damage, and parliament. As the language expanded, English speakers quickly realized what to do if they wanted to sound sophisticated: they would use words that had come from French or Latin. Anglo Saxon words seemed so plain like the Anglo Saxon peasants who spoke them. Let's go back to the two sentences you thought about earlier. When you pictured the hearty welcome, did you see an earthy scene with relatives hugging and talking loudly? Were they drinking beer? Were they wearing lumberjack shirts and jeans? And what about the cordial reception? I bet you pictured a far more classy and refined crowd. Blazers and skirts, wine and caviar. Why is this? How is it that phrases that are considered just about synonymous by the dictionary can evoke such different pictures and feelings? "Hearty" and "welcome" are both Saxon words. "Cordial" and "reception" come from French. The connotation of nobility and authority has persisted around words of French origin. And the connotation of peasantry, real people, salt of the Earth, has persisted around Saxon words. Even if you never heard this history before, the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked by the words you speak. On some level, it's a story you already knew because whether we realize it consciously or only subconsciously, our history lives in the words we speak and hear.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I am going to start with a challenge. I want you to imagine each of these two scenes in as much detail as you can. Scene number one: "They gave us a hearty welcome." Well, who are the people who are giving a hearty welcome? What are they wearing? What are they drinking? OK, scene two: "They gave us a cordial reception." How are these people standing? What expressions are on their faces? What are they wearing and drinking? Fix these pictures in your mind's eye and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them. We'll come back to them later. Now on to our story. In the year 400 C.E. the Celts in Britain were ruled by Romans. This had one benefit for the Celts: the Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes of Northern Europe. But then the Roman Empire began to crumble, and the Romans withdrew from Britain. With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water, did away with the Celts, and formed kingdoms in the British Isles. For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon, became the common language, what we call Old English. Although modern English speakers may think Old English sounds like a different language, if you look and listen closely, you'll find many words that are recognizable. For example, here is what the Lord's Prayer looks like in Old English. At first glance, it may look unfamiliar, but update the spelling a bit, and you'll see many common English words. So the centuries passed with Britains happily speaking Old English, but in the 700's, a series of Viking invasions began, which continued until a treaty split the island in half. On one side were the Saxons. On the other side were the Danes who spoke a language called Old Norse. As Saxons fell in love with their cute Danish neighbors and marriages blurred the boundaries, Old Norse mixed with Old English, and many Old Norse words like freckle, leg, root, skin, and want are still a part of our language. 300 years later, in 1066, the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles. The Normans were Vikings who settled in France. They had abandoned the Viking language and culture in favor of a French lifestyle, but they still fought like Vikings. They placed a Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty. Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-speaking aristocracy and Old English-speaking peasants. The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them who added Latin words to the mix. Old English adapted and grew as thousands of words flowed in, many having to do with government, law, and aristocracy. Words like council, marriage, sovereign, govern, damage, and parliament. As the language expanded, English speakers quickly realized what to do if they wanted to sound sophisticated: they would use words that had come from French or Latin. Anglo Saxon words seemed so plain like the Anglo Saxon peasants who spoke them. Let's go back to the two sentences you thought about earlier. When you pictured the hearty welcome, did you see an earthy scene with relatives hugging and talking loudly? Were they drinking beer? Were they wearing lumberjack shirts and jeans? And what about the cordial reception? I bet you pictured a far more classy and refined crowd. Blazers and skirts, wine and caviar. Why is this? How is it that phrases that are considered just about synonymous by the dictionary can evoke such different pictures and feelings? "Hearty" and "welcome" are both Saxon words. "Cordial" and "reception" come from French. The connotation of nobility and authority has persisted around words of French origin. And the connotation of peasantry, real people, salt of the Earth, has persisted around Saxon words. Even if you never heard this history before, the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked by the words you speak. On some level, it's a story you already knew because whether we realize it consciously or only subconsciously, our history lives in the words we speak and hear.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it does address the same historical event (the Viking invasions) that led to the mixing of Old Norse and Saxon languages. The correct option in Question 4 (C. A series of Viking invasions) is related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (C. Peaceful borders and subsequent intermarriages made it practical for the Saxons to use Old Norse words), as the Viking invasions eventually led to peaceful borders and intermarriages between the Saxons and the Danes.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 4, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every human being starts out the same way: two cells, one from each parent, found each other and became one. And that one cell reproduced itself, dividing, dividing and dividing until there were 10 trillion of them. Do you realize there's more cells
in one person's body than there are stars in the Milky Way? But those 10 trillion cells
aren't just sitting there in a big pile. That would make for a pretty
boring human being! So what is it that says a nose is a nose, and toes is toes? What is it that says this is bone and this is brain and this is heart and this is that little thing
in the back of your throat you can never remember the name of? Everything you are or ever will be made of starts as a tiny book of instructions found in each and every cell. Every time your body
wants to make something, it goes back to the instruction book, looks it up and puts it together. So how does one cell hold
all that information? Let's get small. I mean, really small --
smaller than the tip of a sewing needle. Then we can take a journey
inside a single cell to find out what makes up the book of you, your genome. The first thing we see
is that the whole genome, all your DNA, is contained inside
its own tiny compartment, called the nucleus. If we stretched out all the DNA
in this one cell into a single thread, it would be over 3 feet long! We have to make it fit
in a tiny compartment that's a million times smaller. We could just bunch it up
like Christmas lights, but that could get messy. We need some organization. First, the long thread of DNA
wraps around proteins clustered into little beads
called nucleosomes, which end up looking
like a long, beaded necklace. And that necklace
is wrapped up in its own spiral, like an old telephone cord. And those spirals get layered
on top of one another until we get a neat little shape
that fits inside the nucleus. Voilà! Three feet of DNA
squeezed into a tiny compartment. If only we could hire DNA
to pack our suitcases! Each tiny mass of DNA
is called a chromosome. The book of you would have 46 chapters, one for each chromosome. Twenty-three chapters of your book
came from your mom, and 23 chapters came from your dad. Two of those chapters, called "X" and "Y," determine if you're male, "XY," or female, "XX." Put them together, and we get two almost identical but slightly
different sets of 23 chapters. The tiny variations are what makes
each person different. It's estimated
that all the chapters together hold about 20,000 individual
instructions, called genes. Written out, all those 20,000 instructions are 30 million letters long! If someone were writing
one letter per second, it would take them almost
an entire year to write it once. It turns out that our genome book
is much, much longer than just those 30 million letters -- almost 100 times longer! What are all those extra pages for? Well, each page of instructions
has a few pages of nonsense inserted that have to be taken out
before we end up with something useful. The parts we throw out, we call introns. The instructions we keep, we call exons. We can also have hundreds
of pages in between each gene. Some of these excess pages were inserted by nasty little infections
in our ancestors, but some of them are actually helpful. They protect the ends of each chapter
from being damaged, or some help our cells find
a particular thing they're looking for, or give a cell a signal
to stop making something. All in all, for every page
of instructions, there's almost 100 pages of filler. In the end, each of our books' 46 chapters is between 48 and 250
million letters long. That's 3.2 billion letters total! To type all that copy, you'd be at it for over 100 years, and the book would be
over 600,000 pages long. Every type of cell carries the same book, but each has a set of bookmarks that tell it exactly which pages
it needs to look up. So a bone cell reads only the set
of instructions it needs to become bone. Your brain cells, they read the set that tells them
how to become brain. If some cells suddenly decide
to start reading other instructions, they can actually change
from one type to another. So every little cell in your body
is holding on to an amazing book, full of the instructions for life. Your nose reads nose pages, your toes read toes pages. And that little thing
in the back of your throat? It's got its own pages, too. They're under "uvula."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every human being starts out the same way: two cells, one from each parent, found each other and became one. And that one cell reproduced itself, dividing, dividing and dividing until there were 10 trillion of them. Do you realize there's more cells
in one person's body than there are stars in the Milky Way? But those 10 trillion cells
aren't just sitting there in a big pile. That would make for a pretty

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What determines the sex of an individual in terms of chromosomes?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the number of chromosomes in the human genome, it does relate to chromosomes and their role in determining sex. However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none directly ask about the total number of chromosomes in the human genome.

A more suitable match can be found by re-examining the generated MCQs:

**Question 7: What is the name of the tiny compartment that contains the genome in a cell?** mentions the nucleus but does not discuss the number of chromosomes.

However, it's worth noting that the passage does mention: "The book of you would have 46 chapters, one for each chromosome." 

Given this context and the generated MCQs, the closest match to the ground truth MCQ would be a question that directly asks about or implies the number of chromosomes in the human genome.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly ask about the total number of chromosomes. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the context and the information provided, I would suggest:

**No direct match is available; however, a new question could be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.**

If I had to choose an index from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that **none** of the generated MCQs (1-10) is a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every human being starts out the same way: two cells, one from each parent, found each other and became one. And that one cell reproduced itself, dividing, dividing and dividing until there were 10 trillion of them. Do you realize there's more cells
in one person's body than there are stars in the Milky Way? But those 10 trillion cells
aren't just sitting there in a big pile. That would make for a pretty
boring human being! So what is it that says a nose is a nose, and toes is toes? What is it that says this is bone and this is brain and this is heart and this is that little thing
in the back of your throat you can never remember the name of? Everything you are or ever will be made of starts as a tiny book of instructions found in each and every cell. Every time your body
wants to make something, it goes back to the instruction book, looks it up and puts it together. So how does one cell hold
all that information? Let's get small. I mean, really small --
smaller than the tip of a sewing needle. Then we can take a journey
inside a single cell to find out what makes up the book of you, your genome. The first thing we see
is that the whole genome, all your DNA, is contained inside
its own tiny compartment, called the nucleus. If we stretched out all the DNA
in this one cell into a single thread, it would be over 3 feet long! We have to make it fit
in a tiny compartment that's a million times smaller. We could just bunch it up
like Christmas lights, but that could get messy. We need some organization. First, the long thread of DNA
wraps around proteins clustered into little beads
called nucleosomes, which end up looking
like a long, beaded necklace. And that necklace
is wrapped up in its own spiral, like an old telephone cord. And those spirals get layered
on top of one another until we get a neat little shape
that fits inside the nucleus. Voilà! Three feet of DNA
squeezed into a tiny compartment. If only we could hire DNA
to pack our suitcases! Each tiny mass of DNA
is called a chromosome. The book of you would have 46 chapters, one for each chromosome. Twenty-three chapters of your book
came from your mom, and 23 chapters came from your dad. Two of those chapters, called "X" and "Y," determine if you're male, "XY," or female, "XX." Put them together, and we get two almost identical but slightly
different sets of 23 chapters. The tiny variations are what makes
each person different. It's estimated
that all the chapters together hold about 20,000 individual
instructions, called genes. Written out, all those 20,000 instructions are 30 million letters long! If someone were writing
one letter per second, it would take them almost
an entire year to write it once. It turns out that our genome book
is much, much longer than just those 30 million letters -- almost 100 times longer! What are all those extra pages for? Well, each page of instructions
has a few pages of nonsense inserted that have to be taken out
before we end up with something useful. The parts we throw out, we call introns. The instructions we keep, we call exons. We can also have hundreds
of pages in between each gene. Some of these excess pages were inserted by nasty little infections
in our ancestors, but some of them are actually helpful. They protect the ends of each chapter
from being damaged, or some help our cells find
a particular thing they're looking for, or give a cell a signal
to stop making something. All in all, for every page
of instructions, there's almost 100 pages of filler. In the end, each of our books' 46 chapters is between 48 and 250
million letters long. That's 3.2 billion letters total! To type all that copy, you'd be at it for over 100 years, and the book would be
over 600,000 pages long. Every type of cell carries the same book, but each has a set of bookmarks that tell it exactly which pages
it needs to look up. So a bone cell reads only the set
of instructions it needs to become bone. Your brain cells, they read the set that tells them
how to become brain. If some cells suddenly decide
to start reading other instructions, they can actually change
from one type to another. So every little cell in your body
is holding on to an amazing book, full of the instructions for life. Your nose reads nose pages, your toes read toes pages. And that little thing
in the back of your throat? It's got its own pages, too. They're under "uvula."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, "eka" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, "eka" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back.

This question is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Refers to the same event (the naming of the element Mendelevium in 1963).
2. Has a similar question intent (explaining the significance of the event).
3. Has options that are related to the topic (although they are not identical to the ground truth MCQ options).

However, I must note that the generated MCQ is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the official name given to the element at position 101 on the periodic table, while the generated MCQ asks about the significance of the element being named Mendelevium.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

[Music] [Music] thank you so much it's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart I'm here to tell you a few Tales of passion there's a Jewish saying that I love what is truer than truth answer the story I'm a Storyteller I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common Humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until I end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues Freedom I'm aware of the mystery around us so I write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years I have published a few books but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in Macy and my grandchildren don't think that I'm cool allow me to tell you about my 4 Minutes of Fame one of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker I was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag five women representing five continents and three Olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was I going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anarak looking like the Micheline Man by the middle of February I found my myself in touring where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserve to win but there's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics passion lives here isn't it always true heart is what drives us and determines Our Fate that is what I need for my characters in my books a passionate heart I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers Outsiders and Rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in The Green Room of the stadium I met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses Susan sandon and Sophia Lauren also two women with passionate Hearts when G maai the Noble Prize winner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather and in some in some places in Africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somal Mom a Cambodian activist who fights passionately Against Child prostitution when she was 14 years years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS and of brothels where children are forced to receive 55 clients per day and if they Rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room I received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear but it was far from the Michel in Man's suit that I had anticipated not bad really I look like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag bearers except Sophia Lauren the universal symbol of beauty and passion Sophia is over 70 and she looks great she's sexy slim and Tall with a deep tan now H how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles I don't know when asked in a TV interview how could she look so good she replied posture my back is always straight and I don't make old people's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she didn't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the AA March Sophia Lauren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than I am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the African Savannah holding the flag on her shoulder I joged behind on my tiptoes holding my the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on Sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo I appear too although often between Sophia's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic Stadium my husband is offended when I say this although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than 4 minutes so he shouldn't take it personally I have all the Press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tootsi refugees in Congo by the way 80% of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in Congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of these of this story are a young woman Rose Mendo and her children she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins to tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the Camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young American man Sasha sharnov she manages who manages to put her in a US rescue plane Rose maen and her nine children end up in Phoenix Arizona where they are now living and thriving mapendo in s Swahili means great love the protagonist of my books are strong and passionate women like rose Mendo I don't make them up there's no need for that I look around and I see them everywhere I have worked with women and for women all my life I know them well I was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist although the term had not reached Chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but I was happy to pay it because for every blow that I received I was able to deliver too once when my daughter paa was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that I should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forc labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no Freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called the feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and I have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term change it for God's sake call it afterite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name doesn't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year is 2005 Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her 3-week vacation she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a Hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten mullers Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth teeth she's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she's terrified she doesn't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine Jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called Clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes the husband Furious threatens to kill the American Jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do 2third of the world's labor they own less than 1% of the world's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they are paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families Prosper The Village prospers and eventually so does the whole country when G matai goes to a village in Kenya she talks to the women and explains that the land is Barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a woman's program $20 are given to men's programs women are 51% of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any War today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged in January I saw an exhibit of

[Music] [Music] thank you so much it's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart I'm here to tell you a few Tales of passion there's a Jewish saying that I love what is truer than truth answer the story I'm a Storyteller I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common Humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until I end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues Freedom I'm aware of the mystery around us so I write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years I have published a few books but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in Macy and my grandchildren don't think that I'm cool allow me to tell you about my 4 Minutes of Fame one of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker I was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag five women representing five continents and three Olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was I going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anarak looking like the Micheline Man by the middle of February I found my myself in touring where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserve to win but there's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics passion lives here isn't it always true heart is what drives us and determines Our Fate that is what I need for my characters in my books a passionate heart I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers Outsiders and Rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in The Green Room of the stadium I met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses Susan sandon and Sophia Lauren also two women with passionate Hearts when G maai the Noble Prize winner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather and in some in some places in Africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somal Mom a Cambodian activist who fights passionately Against Child prostitution when she was 14 years years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS and of brothels where children are forced to receive 55 clients per day and if they Rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room I received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear but it was far from the Michel in Man's suit that I had anticipated not bad really I look like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag bearers except Sophia Lauren the universal symbol of beauty and passion Sophia is over 70 and she looks great she's sexy slim and Tall with a deep tan now H how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles I don't know when asked in a TV interview how could she look so good she replied posture my back is always straight and I don't make old people's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she didn't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the AA March Sophia Lauren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than I am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the African Savannah holding the flag on her shoulder I joged behind on my tiptoes holding my the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on Sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo I appear too although often between Sophia's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic Stadium my husband is offended when I say this although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than 4 minutes so he shouldn't take it personally I have all the Press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tootsi refugees in Congo by the way 80% of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in Congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of these of this story are a young woman Rose Mendo and her children she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins to tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the Camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young American man Sasha sharnov she manages who manages to put her in a US rescue plane Rose maen and her nine children end up in Phoenix Arizona where they are now living and thriving mapendo in s Swahili means great love the protagonist of my books are strong and passionate women like rose Mendo I don't make them up there's no need for that I look around and I see them everywhere I have worked with women and for women all my life I know them well I was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist although the term had not reached Chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but I was happy to pay it because for every blow that I received I was able to deliver too once when my daughter paa was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that I should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forc labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no Freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called the feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and I have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term change it for God's sake call it afterite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name doesn't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year is 2005 Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her 3-week vacation she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a Hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten mullers Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth teeth she's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she's terrified she doesn't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine Jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called Clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes the husband Furious threatens to kill the American Jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do 2third of the world's labor they own less than 1% of the world's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they are paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families Prosper The Village prospers and eventually so does the whole country when G matai goes to a village in Kenya she talks to the women and explains that the land is Barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a woman's program $20 are given to men's programs women are 51% of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any War today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make

[Music] [Music] thank you so much it's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart I'm here to tell you a few Tales of passion there's a Jewish saying that I love what is truer than truth answer the story I'm a Storyteller I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common Humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until I end up writing them certain themes keep coming up justice loyalty violence death political and social issues Freedom I'm aware of the mystery around us so I write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years I have published a few books but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in Macy and my grandchildren don't think that I'm cool allow me to tell you about my 4 Minutes of Fame one of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker I was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag five women representing five continents and three Olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was I going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anarak looking like the Micheline Man by the middle of February I found my myself in touring where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserve to win but there's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics passion lives here isn't it always true heart is what drives us and determines Our Fate that is what I need for my characters in my books a passionate heart I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers Outsiders and Rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in The Green Room of the stadium I met the other flag bearers three athletes and the actresses Susan sandon and Sophia Lauren also two women with passionate Hearts when G maai the Noble Prize winner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather and in some in some places in Africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somal Mom a Cambodian activist who fights passionately Against Child prostitution when she was 14 years years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS and of brothels where children are forced to receive 55 clients per day and if they Rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room I received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear but it was far from the Michel in Man's suit that I had anticipated not bad really I look like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag bearers except Sophia Lauren the universal symbol of beauty and passion Sophia is over 70 and she looks great she's sexy slim and Tall with a deep tan now H how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles I don't know when asked in a TV interview how could she look so good she replied posture my back is always straight and I don't make old people's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she didn't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the AA March Sophia Lauren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than I am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the African Savannah holding the flag on her shoulder I joged behind on my tiptoes holding my the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on Sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo I appear too although often between Sophia's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic Stadium my husband is offended when I say this although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than 4 minutes so he shouldn't take it personally I have all the Press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tootsi refugees in Congo by the way 80% of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in Congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of these of this story are a young woman Rose Mendo and her children she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins to tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the Camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young American man Sasha sharnov she manages who manages to put her in a US rescue plane Rose maen and her nine children end up in Phoenix Arizona where they are now living and thriving mapendo in s Swahili means great love the protagonist of my books are strong and passionate women like rose Mendo I don't make them up there's no need for that I look around and I see them everywhere I have worked with women and for women all my life I know them well I was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist although the term had not reached Chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but I was happy to pay it because for every blow that I received I was able to deliver too once when my daughter paa was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that I should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forc labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no Freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called the feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and I have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term change it for God's sake call it afterite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name doesn't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year is 2005 Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her 3-week vacation she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a Hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten mullers Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth teeth she's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she's terrified she doesn't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine Jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called Clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes the husband Furious threatens to kill the American Jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do 2third of the world's labor they own less than 1% of the world's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they are paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families Prosper The Village prospers and eventually so does the whole country when G matai goes to a village in Kenya she talks to the women and explains that the land is Barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a woman's program $20 are given to men's programs women are 51% of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any War today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human

penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more

and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lied beneath the sea the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seaman of baseball this is on a on a Makita projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of the Earth's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon so we went to the moon played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet and our interest in this mountain ranges are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of boundary of creation as we called it into the Rift Valley till a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973 1974 and we're the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley we went down into the Rift Valley this is the all accurate except for one thing it's pitch black it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is 12,000 feet in the Rift Valley it's 9,000 feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the Sun most of our planet is in eternal darkness and in that for that reason you do not have photosynthesis of the deep sea with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a you know dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension we in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense they would they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get seashells up on Mount Everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve we said let's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except that the axis there was missing heat there was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs that there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat and so we went along this mountain range in an area along the Galapagos rift and did we find the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys huge giant chimneys went up to them with our submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it with pegged off-scale pilot made this great observation that's hot then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature with 650 degrees Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the one to Foucault Ridge what you're looking at is incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed was dwarfed by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist giant tubeworms ten feet tall I remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pick a liquor they don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren Rock large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clan no mouth no gut no digestive system they had inside them their body said had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks none of us in our textbooks or that we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from the silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet to an F hours to get to work in the morning two-and-a-half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile on a 42,000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continue to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another we were the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life-forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that it did not did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible climb stone formations and upside down of pools look at that how do you do that that's water upside down we we went in underneath it tapped it and we found that it had the pH of Drano the pH of 11 and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it end at this extreme environment enough hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a pH of 11 a life existed so life was much more creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off Santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach unbeknownst to them in caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and another more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stopped at the water's edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico finding a pools of water this time not upside down right side up bingo it's it's it's out you think you're in error until your fish swims by you're looking at you're looking at brine pools formed by salt dye appears near that was methane was I never seen volcanoes of methane instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by meth never seen this before moving on there's more than just natural history that beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the Titanic the realization that the deep-sea is the largest museum on earth it contains more history than all the museum's on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding that the state of preservation we found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet we then found the Yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship this said Yorktown on the stern more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the numbers of million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be the shipwrecks thanked hundred years before the birth of Christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot Roman temple and then here's one that sank at the time of Homer at 750 BC more recently into the Black Sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's it's it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter's look at the state of those artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they drop they sealed it this ship sank 1500 years ago fortunately we've been able to convince Congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer in its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth and it's I was looking at it yesterday it's up in Seattle okay it comes online it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going to find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown America this is at that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the west and territorial trust we don't have maps of them we don't have maps of them we have maps of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we're going to run this we have no idea what we're going to discover we have no idea what we're going to discover going to discover it an ancient shipwreck of Phoenicians off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center via high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island called the inner space Center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blew goal team switching them off and on running 24 hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it's connected through Internet to the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabits a bandwidth will go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet will map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that 90% of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities they're all on i2 we can then build a command center this is a remote Center at the University of Washington she's talking to the pilot she's 5,000 miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I've started a program thing where you Jim Jim Young who helped we start a program called the Jason project more recently we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for I would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but I will let it kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done if that your win or lose an engineer or a scientist by the eighth grade the game is not over it's over by the eighth grade it's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools and when we have the best middle schools in the world we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her what she's seen and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full reset mode and that's this this I hope this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battlefield for truth and my final question my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build a habitation on Mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
the first question is this our country has to exploration programs one is NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have a Saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration well there's also another program that in another agency within our government in ocean exploration it's in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here's the reason not the reason but here's why I asked that question if you compare NASA's budget annual budget to explore the heavens that's one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72% of the planet so buckle up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what I'm going to try to I hope I make the following points I'm going to make it right now in case I forget is everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school and most of it was not even my college textbooks when I've on geophysicist and and I all my earth science books when I was a student I had to give the wrong answer to get an A we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned to Marshall kaise jiya synclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap but we in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans we're mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something found something else and everything we're going to talk about represents a 1/10 of 1% glimpse because that's all we've seen I have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map fact I commonly ask people have another version of my office and I ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there none over here and they go well it's you'd only try to be you know the same is it a fracture zone is it a hotspot no no that's the only place of ship spin most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored we had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72% of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents you know it's just ludicrous the we are always constantly playing the zero-sum game you know you know we're going to do this we're going to take it away from something else I believe in just a rich in the economy and and we're leaving so much on the table 72% of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50% of the United States of America lies beneath the sea 50% of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that 50% why ok now I began my explorations the hard way back then this was actually my first expedition was I was 17 years old was 49 years ago do the math I'm I'm 66 and I went out to sea on a script ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and I was too young to be it you know I thought it was a great out of the body surfer and I don't walk that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions and over the last 49 years I've done about a hundred and twenty twenty-one to keep doing them expeditions but in the early days the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles Alvin and see cliff and Siana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going and so it's it's very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I was enraptured back in my graduate years was the dawn of plate

are scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear open it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar This might seem like a far-away place in a far-away land. My house is right there in the middle. This was 1992 L.A. Riots. And I remember being 8 years old and looking out there and thinking to myself, "This is it, this is game over. I'm done." The military came in, the cops came in, and I thought they were going to save us, and for some reason they kept on pointing the guns at my people. So I grew up angry, I grew up mad. I struggled watching my parents pay rent at the end of the month. Sometimes they had to take food out of their mouths so that we, my two younger sisters and I, could eat. And the people that I saw taking care of their family and taking care of business were the gang members. So I considered that as a career path, not because they were the ones that, you know, had the girls, had the cars, it was because they were the ones who took care of their families. And I love my family enough to even to consider that as a possibility. But it wasn't always bad. If you haven't put two and two together, I'm a Dodgers fan. I like the Dodgers even more so because Dodgers Stadium sits in the middle of the Elysian Park, one of the biggest parks in L.A., and I remember going out on the weekends with my family and for la carne asada and sharing our cultura and them taking me on trails and showing me all this amazing stuff that they knew. I grew up, I went to Dorsey High School. You might not know Dorsey that much, but you might know Crenshaw High School. Crenshaw and Dorsey are rival high schools, but they are more than just rivals in the traditional sense of rival high schools, they are the birth place of The Bloods and The Crips. So I was in 9th grade detention, and they gave me an ultimatum: They said, "Either you stay in detention, or you go to this thing called Eco Club." And I said, "What?!? Eco Club? Forget you!" But I took a chance and I went over to Eco Club. And the first thing that they said was, "Grab a bag of seeds and let's go out." And I picked jalapeños because I wanted to grill salsa for my mom at the end of that. And they tricked me! Then all of a sudden, I started worrying about photosynthesis and the pH balance, and the UV radiation, and all this different stuff that would make my jalapeños grow. At the end of that semester, they gave me an opportunity to go to the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming. For a kid who has never been out of South Central, to see mountains for the first time, to look up at the night sky and count, I couldn't even count, the stars. For the first time in my life at the age of 15 I saw more stars than I could count. I had to pinch myself and look at that shooting star and say, "No, that's not the ghetto bird coming up at me." And the ghetto bird, you won't find in the Audobon book, it's a police helicopter in case you don't know. And I went back home and I found mentors and friends and family and people who supported me in this, and in 2005, this guy named Richard Louv wrote a book called Last Child in the Woods, and he coined a phrase called "nature-deficit disorder". It's not a medical term, don't worry, you don't have to take drugs for it, it's an easy fix: all you have to do is get outside. Because we have 7 billion people in the world today, but if you were to put all those 7 billion people shoulder-to-shoulder with each other, they could all fit in the city of L.A. It's not necessarily that we are running out of space, it's how we are using that space up. The average U.S. teenager now spends somewhere between 40 and 65 hours a week connected to some type of media device, some kind of technology. That's a full-time job! We're not saying that its bad, we're just saying get out, have fun! And I got together with some friends and we created this thing called the "Natural Leaders Network". And we wanted to find out how other people are getting outside all over the world. We thought it was just us here in the U.S., but no, no, it's all over the world. And we started getting amazing things back: the beaches, the mountains, in the middle of the city, how people got out, just the pure joy of celebrating our connection with nature. And it all started with that one group. I want to give you this new motivation about a new nature movement, and 7 reasons for a new nature movement. You can create your own reasons, but these are 7 reasons that we're talking about. I'm going to speed up a little bit because of time. But, take it from these kids, let's go get outside! Last year I got to climb the grand Teton. I went from being that kid from South Central realizing that somehow I was connected to those mountains, that my community in South Central L.A. was connected to the mountains up there. And it all made sense, the world made sense to me. Science, and math, and history, and English, and all the different things that were happening in this world made sense to me because of that. I went out to be the first one to graduate from my family in high school. I'm the first one. I'm a National Geographic Explorer today. I do these amazing talks, and I'm not telling you these things so I can brag about it, or that I can show off, I'm telling you these things because if a kid from South Central who was about to be a gang member can grow up to be a National Geographic Explorer and sit here in front of you and address you like I am today, then don't ever, ever in your life doubt what you can do. At the end of the day, I do what I do because of my family. My family means the world to me and from this day forward, each one of you in this room is part of that family. I want you go to away with that and I'll leave it with this one quote, which has driven me to this point: "Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. We have seen the future, and the future is ours." It's your future, it's our future, so go get 'em!

The military came in, the cops came in, and I thought they were going to save us, and for some reason they kept on pointing the guns at my people. So I grew up angry, I grew up mad. I struggled watching my parents pay rent at the end of the month. Sometimes they had to take food out of their mouths so that we, my two younger sisters and I, could eat. And the people that I saw taking care of their family and taking care of business were the gang members. So I considered that as a career path, not because they were the ones that, you know, had the girls, had the cars, it was because they were the ones who took care of their families. And I love my family enough to even to consider that as a possibility. But it wasn't always bad. If you haven't put two and two together, I'm a Dodgers fan. I like the Dodgers even more so because Dodgers Stadium sits in the middle of the Elysian Park, one of the biggest parks in L.A., and I remember going out on the weekends with my family and for la carne asada and sharing our cultura and them taking me on trails and showing me all this amazing stuff that they knew. I grew up, I went to Dorsey High School. You might not know Dorsey that much, but you might know Crenshaw High School. Crenshaw and Dorsey are rival high schools, but they are more than just rivals in the traditional sense of rival high schools, they are the birth place of The Bloods and The Crips. So I was in 9th grade detention, and they gave me an ultimatum: They said, "Either you stay in detention, or you go to this thing called Eco Club." And I said, "What?!? Eco Club? Forget you!" But I took a chance and I went over to Eco Club. And the first thing that they said was, "Grab a bag of seeds and let's go out." And I picked jalapeños because I wanted to grill salsa for my mom at the end of that. And they tricked me! Then all of a sudden, I started worrying about photosynthesis and the pH balance, and the UV radiation, and all this different stuff that would make my jalapeños grow. At the end of that semester, they gave me an opportunity to go to the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming. For a kid who has never been out of South Central, to see mountains for the first time, to look up at the night sky and count, I couldn't even count, the stars. For the first time in my life at the age of 15 I saw more stars than I could count. I had to pinch myself and look at that shooting star and say, "No, that's not the ghetto bird coming up at me." And the ghetto bird, you won't find in the Audobon book, it's a police helicopter in case you don't know. And I went back home and I found mentors and friends and family and people who supported me in this, and in 2005, this guy named Richard Louv wrote a book called Last Child in the Woods, and he coined a phrase called "nature-deficit disorder". It's not a medical term, don't worry, you don't have to take drugs for it, it's an easy fix: all you have to do is get outside. Because we have 7 billion people in the world today, but if you were to put all those 7 billion people shoulder-to-shoulder with each other, they could all fit in the city of L.A. It's not necessarily that we are running out of space, it's how we are using that space up. The average U.S. teenager now spends somewhere between 40 and 65 hours a week connected to some type of media device, some kind of technology. That's a full-time job! We're not saying that its bad, we're just saying get out, have fun! And I got together with some friends and we created this thing called the "Natural Leaders Network". And we wanted to find out how other people are getting outside all over the world. We thought it was just us here in the U.S., but no, no, it's all over the world. And we started getting amazing things back: the beaches, the mountains, in the middle of the city, how people got out, just the pure joy of celebrating our connection with nature. And it all started with that one group. I want to give you this new motivation about a new nature movement, and 7 reasons for a new nature movement. You can create your own reasons, but these are 7 reasons that we're talking about. I'm going to speed up a little bit because of time. But, take it from these kids, let's go get outside! Last year I got to climb the grand Teton. I went from being that kid from South Central realizing that somehow I was connected to those mountains, that my community in South Central L.A. was connected to the mountains up there. And it all made sense, the world made sense to me. Science, and math, and history, and English, and all the different things that were happening in this world made sense to me because of that. I went out to be the first one to graduate from my family in high school. I'm the first one. I'm a National Geographic Explorer today. I do these amazing talks, and I'm not telling you these things so I can brag about it, or that I can show off, I'm telling you these things because if a kid from South Central who was about to be a gang member can grow up to be a National Geographic Explorer and sit here in front of you and address you like I am today, then don't ever, ever in your life doubt what you can do. At the end of the day, I do what I do because of my family. My family means the world to me and from this day forward, each one of you in this room is part of that family. I want you go to away with that and I'll leave it with this one quote, which has driven me to this point: "Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed. You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore. We have seen the future, and the future is ours." It's your future, it's our future, so go get 'em!

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Coral reefs are some of the most
spectacular ecosystems on the planet. They're also some of the most vulnerable. But how can we protect the reefs and the animals and plants
who rely on them? And how can we make sure our protected areas aren't hurting those
who use reefs to survive? These are some of the big questions facing marine conservation
biologists today. Let's take Fiji, for example. Fiji is series of islands
in the South Pacific Ocean. To help balance the need
for conservation and making a living, scientists had suggested
that instead of one big park which provides a lot of coverage
for one reef system while leaving the rest unprotected, a better way is to create
a system of protected areas nested together like pearls on a string. This idea is called connectivity. In this way, scientists can protect
lots of different habitats while not excluding people
from their traditional fishing grounds. Now, the only way this string-of-pearls
kind of reserve network is going to work is if each park is connected
to other parks. There are two main benefits to this. First of all, insurance. If something bad happens to one park, say, an oil spill or coral bleaching, then because that park
is part of a system, it can be reseeded from other parks
that escaped the event. The second benefit is representation. By conserving many different areas, scientists ensure that lots
of different habitats get protected. This way, they can make sure
all the different marine habitats in Fiji, such as coral reefs,
mangroves, and sea-grass beds, are all represented. This way, we don't unduly settle
any particular village or group of people with the economic burden of having
their fishing grounds off-limits. By sharing the cost
around the communities, they can also share the benefits. So if we agree
that rather than one big park, we should have lots of parks of different sizes
and covering different habitats, then scientists need to make sure
those smaller parks are connected, because if they're not,
they probably won't be self-sustaining. But how do we know that? That's where genetics and DNA come in. By looking at how closely related the fish in each one
of these small reserves in Fiji are to each other, scientists can figure out how much migration is going on
among the reserves within the system. Now it's important to look
at a variety of different species because there's no guarantee
that what's going on with these guys is what's going on with these guys. But if we look closely
and at enough species, we can see whether or not
the necklace is working. What scientists have found
so far is that, in general, there's a fair amount of connectivity
amongst the parks within Fiji. But it's not just a big free-for-all; rather, it seems that, for some species, babies born in the far west
are having a hard time making it to the islands in the far east. To help deal with that,
conservation biologists are suggesting that there be enough parks
in both the east and the west to keep the populations healthy. This isn't just in Fiji, either. Lessons about reserve connectivity
can help across the world. In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Bahamas, scientists are using a variety
of tools to help understand how individual parks
can function together, so that their sum is greater
than their whole. And this way, we can keep
the beautiful necklace that is our coral reefs, intact.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What best describes a coral reef?
Options: A. A collection of cement like structures, B. Spectacular ecosystems, C. Some petrified driftwood that makes a good home for various organisms, D. A bounty of colors in a barren land
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What does the concept of "connectivity" refer to in the context of coral reef conservation, and what are its benefits?
Options: A. Connectivity refers to protecting only coral reefs and excluding other marine habitats, which provides benefits such as increased biodiversity., B. Connectivity refers to establishing a network of protected areas that are linked together, which provides benefits such as insurance and representation., C. Connectivity refers to studying the genetics and DNA of fish in coral reefs, which provides benefits such as improved understanding of migration patterns., D. Connectivity refers to creating a single large park for conservation, which provides benefits such as increased protection and reduced human impact.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Coral reefs are some of the most
spectacular ecosystems on the planet. They're also some of the most vulnerable. But how can we protect the reefs and the animals and plants
who rely on them? And how can we make sure our protected areas aren't hurting those
who use reefs to survive? These are some of the big questions facing marine conservation
biologists today. Let's take Fiji, for example. Fiji is series of islands
in the South Pacific Ocean. To help balance the need
for conservation and making a living, scientists had suggested
that instead of one big park which provides a lot of coverage
for one reef system while leaving the rest unprotected, a better way is to create
a system of protected areas nested together like pearls on a string. This idea is called connectivity. In this way, scientists can protect
lots of different habitats while not excluding people
from their traditional fishing grounds. Now, the only way this string-of-pearls
kind of reserve network is going to work is if each park is connected
to other parks. There are two main benefits to this. First of all, insurance. If something bad happens to one park, say, an oil spill or coral bleaching, then because that park
is part of a system, it can be reseeded from other parks
that escaped the event. The second benefit is representation. By conserving many different areas, scientists ensure that lots
of different habitats get protected. This way, they can make sure
all the different marine habitats in Fiji, such as coral reefs,
mangroves, and sea-grass beds, are all represented. This way, we don't unduly settle
any particular village or group of people with the economic burden of having
their fishing grounds off-limits. By sharing the cost
around the communities, they can also share the benefits. So if we agree
that rather than one big park, we should have lots of parks of different sizes
and covering different habitats, then scientists need to make sure
those smaller parks are connected, because if they're not,
they probably won't be self-sustaining. But how do we know that? That's where genetics and DNA come in. By looking at how closely related the fish in each one
of these small reserves in Fiji are to each other, scientists can figure out how much migration is going on
among the reserves within the system. Now it's important to look
at a variety of different species because there's no guarantee
that what's going on with these guys is what's going on with these guys. But if we look closely
and at enough species, we can see whether or not
the necklace is working. What scientists have found
so far is that, in general, there's a fair amount of connectivity
amongst the parks within Fiji. But it's not just a big free-for-all; rather, it seems that, for some species, babies born in the far west
are having a hard time making it to the islands in the far east. To help deal with that,
conservation biologists are suggesting that there be enough parks
in both the east and the west to keep the populations healthy. This isn't just in Fiji, either. Lessons about reserve connectivity
can help across the world. In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Bahamas, scientists are using a variety
of tools to help understand how individual parks
can function together, so that their sum is greater
than their whole. And this way, we can keep
the beautiful necklace that is our coral reefs, intact.

[Music] [Applause] let's just start by looking at some great photographs this is an icon of National Geographic an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry but the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic and I shudder to think what they are going to do to this photograph oh the wrath of Photoshop this is a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale oh he mounted the camera on the tail poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas bronze sculptures the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklin polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth they're not very good swimmers and we know what's happening into the ice these are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa photographed by Chris John's shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels this is a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard a great portraitist and Jane Goodall making her own special connection photographed by Nick Nichols this is a soap disco in Spain photographed by David Alan Harvey and David said that there was a lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but hey it's at least it's hygienic these are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance by David Doubilet and this is a comet captured by dr. you and Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic without movie stars photographed by Emory Kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl today's saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here's an example four years ago I was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware Beaches but I turned away for a moment and he got caught into a Riptide and started to be pulled out towards a jetty I went I can stand here right now and see as I go tearing into the water after him the moment slowing down and freezing into this arrangement I can see the rocks are over here there's a wave about to crash onto him I can see his hands reaching out and I can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad I got him the wave break Oh broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it's called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer now I have to tell you I was talking to Kyle last week about this that I was going to tell this story he said oh yeah I remember that too I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me I thought I was a hero so this represents this is a across sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photo journalists working at the very top of their craft except one this photograph was taken by dr. Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in Chad called zoo coma the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what Nick did up to a point this is a serval cat he's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's cutting across and he stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole Nick or the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of a lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of zoo coma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa here's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for that was with the elephants this story pivoted Nick along with researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her Annie and they began tracking her movements the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of Park Rangers but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd and they only came for the ivory and this is actually one of the Rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there that it was still valuable but what Nick did was he brought back with it was a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the Rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflict now let's go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live in urban rather than rural environs and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them Jonas bendixson a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my here's my proposal let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of Mumbai India and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really you know major part of the city what Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exists in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned by staying tightly focused in one place Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community and he did it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with the sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer Brian scary and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that Bryan and Randy created are among the best capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja I've seen sort of okay pictures of by catch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to Europe and here in China Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain but there are also glimmers of hope and I think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we're not only going we're not we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions and Brian photographed a Marine Sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who was honored last year at last year's Ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other Jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fitted with high-tech prothesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you could imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins you know of the march of the Penguins this is sort of the munch of the Penguins here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out but then Paul got in the water and he he said he was never really afraid of this well this this one female came up to him she's probably it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph but she's 12 feet long so she is pretty significant in size and Paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how look how big I am or you know my what big teeth you have then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him she dropped them off and then they would swim away she kind of look at him go what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him she did this for over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head it's just resulted in a fantastic photograph eventually though Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her kind of just puffing out you know snorting out and sort of disgust and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and came back with not just a collection of photographs but an amazing experience and a great story it is these kinds of stories ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism I believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] let's just start by looking at some great photographs this is an icon of National Geographic an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry but the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic and I shudder to think what they are going to do to this photograph oh the wrath of Photoshop this is a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale oh he mounted the camera on the tail poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas bronze sculptures the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklin polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth they're not very good swimmers and we know what's happening into the ice these are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa photographed by Chris John's shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels this is a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard a great portraitist and Jane Goodall making her own special connection photographed by Nick Nichols this is a soap disco in Spain photographed by David Alan Harvey and David said that there was a lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but hey it's at least it's hygienic these are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance by David Doubilet and this is a comet captured by dr. you and Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic without movie stars photographed by Emory Kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl today's saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here's an example four years ago I was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware Beaches but I turned away for a moment and he got caught into a Riptide and started to be pulled out towards a jetty I went I can stand here right now and see as I go tearing into the water after him the moment slowing down and freezing into this arrangement I can see the rocks are over here there's a wave about to crash onto him I can see his hands reaching out and I can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad I got him the wave break Oh broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it's called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer now I have to tell you I was talking to Kyle last week about this that I was going to tell this story he said oh yeah I remember that too I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me I thought I was a hero so this represents this is a across sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photo journalists working at the very top of their craft except one this photograph was taken by dr. Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in Chad called zoo coma the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what Nick did up to a point this is a serval cat he's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's cutting across and he stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole Nick or the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of a lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of zoo coma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa here's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for that was with the elephants this story pivoted Nick along with researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her Annie and they began tracking her movements the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of Park Rangers but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd and they only came for the ivory and this is actually one of the Rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there that it was still valuable but what Nick did was he brought back with it was a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the Rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflict now let's go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live in urban rather than rural environs and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them Jonas bendixson a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my here's my proposal let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of Mumbai India and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really you know major part of the city what Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exists in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned by staying tightly focused in one place Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community and he did it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with the sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer Brian scary and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that Bryan and Randy created are among the best capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja I've seen sort of okay pictures of by catch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to Europe and here in China Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain but there are also glimmers of hope and I think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we're not only going we're not we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions and Brian photographed a Marine Sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who was honored last year at last year's Ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other Jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fitted with high-tech prothesis they exit the medical system

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] let's just start by looking at some great photographs this is an icon of National Geographic an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry but the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic and I shudder to think what they are going to do to this photograph oh the wrath of Photoshop this is a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale oh he mounted the camera on the tail poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas bronze sculptures the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklin polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth they're not very good swimmers and we know what's happening into the ice these are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa photographed by Chris John's shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels this is a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard a great portraitist and Jane Goodall making her own special connection photographed by Nick Nichols this is a soap disco in Spain photographed by David Alan Harvey and David said that there was a lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but hey it's at least it's hygienic these are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance by David Doubilet and this is a comet captured by dr. you and Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic without movie stars photographed by Emory Kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl today's saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here's an example four years ago I was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware Beaches but I turned away for a moment and he got caught into a Riptide and started to be pulled out towards a jetty I went I can stand here right now and see as I go tearing into the water after him the moment slowing down and freezing into this arrangement I can see the rocks are over here there's a wave about to crash onto him I can see his hands reaching out and I can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad I got him the wave break Oh broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it's called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer now I have to tell you I was talking to Kyle last week about this that I was going to tell this story he said oh yeah I remember that too I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me I thought I was a hero so this represents this is a across sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photo journalists working at the very top of their craft except one this photograph was taken by dr. Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in Chad called zoo coma the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what Nick did up to a point this is a serval cat he's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's cutting across and he stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole Nick or the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of a lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of zoo coma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa here's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for that was with the elephants this story pivoted Nick along with researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her Annie and they began tracking her movements the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of Park Rangers but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd and they only came for the ivory and this is actually one of the Rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there that it was still valuable but what Nick did was he brought back with it was a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the Rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflict now let's go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live in urban rather than rural environs and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them Jonas bendixson a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my here's my proposal let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of Mumbai India and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really you know major part of the city what Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exists in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned by staying tightly focused in one place Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community and he did it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with the sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer Brian scary and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that Bryan and Randy created are among the best capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja I've seen sort of okay pictures of by catch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to Europe and here in China Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain but there are also glimmers of hope and I think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we're not only going we're not we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions and Brian photographed a Marine Sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who was honored last year at last year's Ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other Jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fitted with high-tech prothesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you could imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins you know of the march of the Penguins this is sort of the munch of the Penguins here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out but then Paul got in the water and he he said he was never really afraid of this well this this one female came up to him she's probably it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph but she's 12 feet long so she is pretty significant in size and Paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how look how big I am or you know my what big teeth you have then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him she dropped them off and then they would swim away she kind of look at him go what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him she did this for over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head it's just resulted in a fantastic photograph eventually though Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her kind of just puffing out you know snorting out and sort of disgust and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and came back with not just a collection of photographs but an amazing experience and a great story it is these kinds of stories ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism I believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today thank you

the Earth there are currently 7 billion people living on 30% of its surface and all of them are dependent on the remaining 70% the ocean the ocean is the largest source of food in the world fish is the main daily source of protein for 1.2 billion people but Fishers are more or and more frequently returning home with empty Nets let's turn the clock back a little some scientists say that in the last 60 years stocks of large fish have fallen by 90% they are warning that we are facing the collapse of all types of fish species in less than 50 years the reason for this over fishing Longline fishing vessels deploy 1.4 billion hooks a year 1.4 4 billion hooks each with a slice of fish hanging from them as bait there are trolling vessels that cast Nets with an opening of up to 23,000 M squared the size of four football pitches and big enough to hold 13 jumbo Jets or more commonly more than 500 tons of fish amongst these 500 tons of fish there is a lot of by catch by catch is Marine creatures incidentally caught often at large quantity typically shrimp trollers throw 80 to 90% of the Marine creatures caught back overboard this means that for 1 kilo of shrimp up to 9 kilos of other Marine Wildlife is caught and wasted to relieve the strain on wild fish 47% of our Seafood demand is farmed fish but Marine aquaculture is more of a nail in a coffin than a Lifeline many of the farm fish are carniverous that is they eat other smaller fish five kilos of captured Wildfish are needed to produce 1 kilo of farm reared salmon aquaculture just converts low value small fish into higher value bigger ones it does not create more fish the majority of European fish stocks are overfished historically EU Fisheries ministers have set fishing limits exceeding scientific advice in 2008 fishing limits were defined for the highly prized blue fin tuna science SST recommended a fishing limit of 10,000 tons to rebuild the increasingly depleted population however the EU and other fishing Nations decided on a fishing limit of 29,500 tons three times what scientists had suggested then despite this already inflated limit 61,000 tons of blue fin tuna were caught that is six times more than the recommended limit billions of Euro in public subsid are fueling this over fishing if this continues soon there will be no fish left how do we end overfishing your politicians have the responsibility for making the decisions in Brussels that will end over fishing citizens have responsibility of encouraging and supporting their politicians to make those decisions

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nearly every one of your science classes starts off with the scientific method. You recognize this? Ask a question, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, collect data, draw conclusions, and then memorize a bunch of facts. This is really boring! Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook, and learning is not memorizing facts for tests. Yet, that is exactly what we do. We have to change this! We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society by looking towards tomorrow, by going through a path from involvement to imagination to invention to innovation. And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story about how we discovered how geckos stick. First you need to get involved. You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself. We know that learning by being an active researcher is the best way to learn. Imagine being in my lab and trying to discover how geckos stick. "Here is one of our subjects. This is a crested gecko. We are going to put the gecko on glass and we're going to use a high speed camera that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second. There he goes. OK, record it. There's the animal's toes." "So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?" How do they do this? We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right? It's hard to believe. Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes, and those hairs are really small compared to your hair, and the little tips at the end are even smaller. Well, my student Tanya, who is not much older than some of you when she did this, a sophomore undergraduate, tried to figure this out, and we told that her that in order to do this, you'd have to measure the force of a single hair. Though we kind of only did this jokingly because these hairs are so small, we didn't think it was possible. But Tanya didn't know that, and she went on to build the simplest, most beautiful measurement device ever. Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done. Thank you.

Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done. Thank you.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nearly every one of your science classes starts off with the scientific method. You recognize this? Ask a question, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, collect data, draw conclusions, and then memorize a bunch of facts. This is really boring! Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook, and learning is not memorizing facts for tests. Yet, that is exactly what we do. We have to change this! We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society by looking towards tomorrow, by going through a path from involvement to imagination to invention to innovation. And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story about how we discovered how geckos stick. First you need to get involved. You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself. We know that learning by being an active researcher is the best way to learn. Imagine being in my lab and trying to discover how geckos stick. "Here is one of our subjects. This is a crested gecko. We are going to put the gecko on glass and we're going to use a high speed camera that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second. There he goes. OK, record it. There's the animal's toes." "So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?" How do they do this? We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right? It's hard to believe. Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes, and those hairs are really small compared to your hair, and the little tips at the end are even smaller. Well, my student Tanya, who is not much older than some of you when she did this, a sophomore undergraduate, tried to figure this out, and we told that her that in order to do this, you'd have to measure the force of a single hair. Though we kind of only did this jokingly because these hairs are so small, we didn't think it was possible.

Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Tap dance: one of America's major contributions to the world of percussive dance, born out of the melding of African and European dance traditions. There's so many variations within tap dance, as many approaches as there have been tap dancers. And there have been a lot! Since its birth, over 125 years ago, tap dance has grown up in the world of American popular entertainment. From minstral shows and vaudeville, to night clubs, musical theater, and movie musicals, tap dance has held a featured role. And your approach depends on when in the history's lineage you decide to connect. The landscape of American entertainment shifted in the 1950s and 60s. Big bands became cost-prohibitive, rock and roll was becoming a popular music, and American musical theater moved towards a format incorporating ballet with narrative rather than the extension of variety shows that it had been in the past. All these factors pushed tap dancing to the fringes of the entertainment world. Tap dance still existed; there were dancers, but it was outside of the popular discourse. There were fewer and fewer places to dance and very little need for new tap dancers, so those who have been dancing in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, really had no one to pass along the art form to. In the 1970s, a multifaceted resurgence began. Modern dancers became interested in the older tap dancers, drawing them out of retirement to teach. Grassroots-organized tap festivals began to spring up, featuring the older tap dancers teaching the technique and the history of the craft. Older dancers also came out of retirement to perform with groups such as The Copasetics and The Original Hoofers, traveling the world. Even Broadway regained interest in the form, with Gregory Hines becoming a public figure for tap dance on the stage and in feature films. Since then, the resurgence has spawned a more popular interest, with Savion Glover at the nexus of the crowd. Considered the quintessential tap dancer, Glover presents the form as a pure musician. Since the 1990s, and thanks in a large part to the work of Savion Glover, we've seen a rise in young people's interest in tap dance. I'm part of that generation. Today, as we begin to rediscover the craft, we continue to look back and take examples of what tap dance was from past generations, at the same time, discovering our own unique approaches. There is so much freedom today. We can take what exists and apply past examples within our own unique context - today's perspective on tap dance. It all really boils down to two pieces of metal on a leather-soled shoe, the wood to dance on, an audience to watch and listen, and something to say. It's the balancing of these elements that is a tap dancer's craft work.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Tap dance: one of America's major contributions to the world of percussive dance, born out of the melding of African and European dance traditions. There's so many variations within tap dance, as many approaches as there have been tap dancers. And there have been a lot! Since its birth, over 125 years ago, tap dance has grown up in the world of American popular entertainment. From minstral shows and vaudeville, to night clubs, musical theater, and movie musicals, tap dance has held a featured role. And your approach depends on when in the history's lineage you decide to connect. The landscape of American entertainment shifted in the 1950s and 60s. Big bands became cost-prohibitive, rock and roll was becoming a popular music, and American musical theater moved towards a format incorporating ballet with narrative rather than the extension of variety shows that it had been in the past. All these factors pushed tap dancing to the fringes of the entertainment world. Tap dance still existed; there were dancers, but it was outside of the popular discourse. There were fewer and fewer places to dance and very little need for new tap dancers, so those who have been dancing in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, really had no one to pass along the art form to. In the 1970s, a multifaceted resurgence began. Modern dancers became interested in the older tap dancers, drawing them out of retirement to teach. Grassroots-organized tap festivals began to spring up, featuring the older tap dancers teaching the technique and the history of the craft. Older dancers also came out of retirement to perform with groups such as The Copasetics and The Original Hoofers, traveling the world. Even Broadway regained interest in the form, with Gregory Hines becoming a public figure for tap dance on the stage and in feature films. Since then, the resurgence has spawned a more popular interest, with Savion Glover at the nexus of the crowd. Considered the quintessential tap dancer, Glover presents the form as a pure musician. Since the 1990s, and thanks in a large part to the work of Savion Glover, we've seen a rise in young people's interest in tap dance. I'm part of that generation. Today, as we begin to rediscover the craft, we continue to look back and take examples of what tap dance was from past generations, at the same time, discovering our own unique approaches. There is so much freedom today. We can take what exists and apply past examples within our own unique context - today's perspective on tap dance. It all really boils down to two pieces of metal on a leather-soled shoe, the wood to dance on, an audience to watch and listen, and something to say. It's the balancing of these elements that is a tap dancer's craft work.

One of the most striking properties
about life is that it has color. To understand the phenomenon of color,
it helps to think about light as a wave. But, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit
about waves in general. Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean
watching a cork bob up and down in the water. The first thing you notice about
the motion is that it repeats itself. The cork traces the same path over and
over again... up and down, up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion
is characteristic of waves. Then you notice something else... using a stopwatch, you measure
the time it takes for the piece of cork to go over its highest position down
to its lowest and then back up again. Suppose this takes two seconds. To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on. That is, how long it takes a wave to go
through its full range of motion once. The same information can be expressed
in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency. Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you
how frequent the waves are. That is, how many of them
go by in one second. If you know how many seconds
one full wave takes, then it's easy to work out
how many waves go by in one second. In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second. So enough about bobbing corks...
What about light and color? If light is a wave, then it must
have a frequency. Right? Well... yes, it does. And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It's called color. That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure
of how quickly the light waves are waving. If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly, like we can with the cork and the ocean. But the frequency of the light
we see is so high, it waves up and down about
400 million million times a second, that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is. The lowest frequency light that we can see
is red and the highest frequency is purple. In between all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum. So, what if you had a yellow pencil
sitting on your desk? Well, the sun emits all colors of light,
so light of all colors is hitting your pencil. The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors. What happens to the blue,
purple and red light? They get absorbed and the energy
they are carrying is turned into heat. It is similar with objects
of other colors. Blue things reflect blue light,
red things reflect red light and so on. White objects reflect all colors of light, while black things do exactly the opposite
and absorb at all frequencies. This - by the way - is why it's uncomfortable
to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
One of the most striking properties
about life is that it has color. To understand the phenomenon of color,
it helps to think about light as a wave. But, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit
about waves in general. Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean
watching a cork bob up and down in the water. The first thing you notice about
the motion is that it repeats itself. The cork traces the same path over and
over again... up and down, up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion
is characteristic of waves. Then you notice something else... using a stopwatch, you measure
the time it takes for the piece of cork to go over its highest position down
to its lowest and then back up again. Suppose this takes two seconds. To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on. That is, how long it takes a wave to go
through its full range of motion once. The same information can be expressed
in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency. Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you
how frequent the waves are. That is, how many of them
go by in one second. If you know how many seconds
one full wave takes, then it's easy to work out
how many waves go by in one second. In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second. So enough about bobbing corks...
What about light and color? If light is a wave, then it must
have a frequency. Right? Well... yes, it does. And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It's called color. That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure
of how quickly the light waves are waving. If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly, like we can with the cork and the ocean. But the frequency of the light
we see is so high, it waves up and down about
400 million million times a second, that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is. The lowest frequency light that we can see
is red and the highest frequency is purple. In between all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum. So, what if you had a yellow pencil
sitting on your desk? Well, the sun emits all colors of light,
so light of all colors is hitting your pencil. The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors. What happens to the blue,
purple and red light? They get absorbed and the energy
they are carrying is turned into heat. It is similar with objects
of other colors. Blue things reflect blue light,
red things reflect red light and so on. White objects reflect all colors of light, while black things do exactly the opposite
and absorb at all frequencies. This - by the way - is why it's uncomfortable
to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: White objects reflect all colors of light and black objects absorb all colors of light.
Options: A. True, B. False

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy because of the letter "b". Since it doesn't spell a sound, most folks can't figure out what it's doing there. But in spite of what most of us learn in school, sound is never the most important aspect of spelling an English word. A word's meaning and history need to come first. To doubt means to question, to waver, to hesitate. As a noun, it means uncertainty or confusion. The present-day English word "doubt" started as a Latin word, "dubitare". It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both its "buh" sound and its letter "b". And then it came into English in the 13th century. About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the "b" into the word's spelling, even though no one pronounced it that way. But why would they do this? Why would anyone in their right mind reinsert a silent letter into a spelling? Well, because they knew Latin, the scribes understood that the root of "doubt" had a "b" in it. Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin, the "b" was kept because it marked important, meaningful connections to other related words, like "dubious" and "indubitalbly," which were subsequently borrowed into English from the same Latin root, "dubitare". Understanding these historical connections not only helped us to spell "doubt," but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words. But the story doesn't end there. If we look even deeper, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt, just how revealing that "b" can be. There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters "d-o-u-b": one is doubt, and the other is double. We can build lots of other words on each of these bases, like doubtful and doubtless, or doublet, and redouble, and doubloon. It turns out that if we look into their history, we can see that they both derive from the same Latin forms. The meaning of double, two, is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt. See, when we doubt, when we hesitate, we second guess ourselves. When we have doubts about something, when we have questions or confusion, we are of two minds. Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt. That Old English word was "tweogan," a word whose relationship to "two" is clear in its spelling as well. So the next time you are in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does, take a second look. What you find just might make you do a double-take.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: According to Cooke, sound is never the most important aspect of spelling an English word. What should come first?

About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the "b" into the word's spelling, even though no one pronounced it that way. But why would they do this? Why would anyone in their right mind reinsert a silent letter into a spelling? Well, because they knew Latin, the scribes understood that the root of "doubt" had a "b" in it. Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin, the "b" was kept because it marked important, meaningful connections to other related words, like "dubious" and "indubitalbly," which were subsequently borrowed into English from the same Latin root, "dubitare". Understanding these historical connections not only helped us to spell "doubt," but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words. But the story doesn't end there. If we look even deeper, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt, just how revealing that "b" can be. There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters "d-o-u-b": one is doubt, and the other is double. We can build lots of other words on each of these bases, like doubtful and doubtless, or doublet, and redouble, and doubloon. It turns out that if we look into their history, we can see that they both derive from the same Latin forms. The meaning of double, two, is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt. See, when we doubt, when we hesitate, we second guess ourselves. When we have doubts about something, when we have questions or confusion, we are of two minds. Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt. That Old English word was "tweogan," a word whose relationship to "two" is clear in its spelling as well. So the next time you are in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does, take a second look. What you find just might make you do a double-take.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Picture this: your friend and you are watching a sitcom and a sassy sidekick walks into a room, carrying a four-tiered wedding cake. He trips, falls, and face-plants into the cake. Your friend doubles over with laughter and says, "It's so ridiculous! So ironic!" Well, quick, what do you do? Do you laugh along with the laugh track and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go? Or, do you throw caution to the wind and explain the true meaning of irony? If you're me, you choose the latter. Unfortunately, irony has been completely misunderstood. We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny or coincidental. And while many examples of true irony can be funny, that is not the driving factor of being ironic. A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact opposite of what was expected. If you expect A, but get B, then you have irony. Let's take the slap-stick cake situation as an example. When someone walks in precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone, trips, falls, and makes a mess, it is funny, but it's not ironic. In fact, you probably expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip. When he does, reality aligns with expectations, and so that is not irony. But what if the sassy sidekick walked in wearing a gold medal that he'd won at the cake walking event at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier? Then, maybe there would have been a reasonable expectation that he would have been more skilled when carrying a ridiculously large cake. Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick, irony would have been exemplified. Another example. A senior citizen texting and blogging. The common and reasonable expectation of more mature men and women is that they don't like or know technology, that they have a hard time turning on a computer, or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s. One should not expect them to be connected, high-tech, or savvy enough to text or to be blogging, which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing that "back in my day," they never had. So when Granny pulls out her smart phone to post pictures of her dentures or her grandkids, irony ensues. Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met. That is irony. So while the cake dropper might not be ironic, there are all kinds of situations in life that are. Go out, and find those true examples of irony.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Our Earth is a collection of puzzle pieces that make up the universe. In the vast darkness of space, the universe is lit by stars, which could one day become a supernova and create all the puzzle pieces that we know today as the elements. All elements were formed and released into space by exploding stars. For centuries, humans have tried to discover what makes up the world around them. Little did they know that all the pieces they needed were right under their noses. The discovery of these pieces revolutionized our understanding of the world and allowed for the creation of what might be the greatest gift to science: the periodic table. So, where are these elements, and how do we find a means to order them? Well, believe it or not, ancient civilizations were very much aware of many elements around them, but they did not identify them as the pieces of our universe. Elements like gold, silver, and copper were easily spotted by ancient cultures, and were used for multiple purposes like jewelry and tools. Why were these elements spotted so easily? Think of the periodic table as a puzzle. The corner pieces are edges of a puzzle, are generally the easiest to find and place because they stand out with their smooth edges, and clearly don't interlock with other puzzle pieces. Like puzzle pieces, elements can be choosy on who they interact with. Some like to react with other elements, while others do not. The elements that do not interact with other elements are easy to pin-point, while the ones who like to interact with others are difficult to find. Gold, silver, and copper are some of the choosier elements so we can find them easier. So let's fast forward to the late 1600's where Hennig Brand, a German alchemist, was busy working in his laboratory. Like many other alchemists of his time, Brand was trying to extract gold from the human body. Brand hit upon what he thought was the most obvious answer to his problem: urine. Urine is gold in coloration and could perhaps have gold in it. So, Brand collected as much urine as he possibly could, much of it being his own, then he decided to boil it down in hopes of obtaining gold. So Brand boiled his, well, urine, down until he collected a paste and heated the paste to a very high temperature. Eventually smoke appeared and the material burned brightly and violently. Brand had unknowingly isolated phosphorous from his urine. It was the first time anyone had discovered an element, but he didn't really understand what he had done. At the time of Brand, the concept of element had not been discovered. Instead ancient Greek principles of objects being composed of earth, water, air, and fire were predominant. It wasn't until the work of Antoine Lavoisier, who is now known as the father of chemistry, that science defined what an element was. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down by existing chemical means. Lavoisier created a list of the known elements of his time and tried to put the elements in some sort of order in which they could be classified, such as gases or metals. He was the first one to try to put the puzzle together. This was just the beginning of a means to organize the known elements of his time. Many other chemists then came along to make the puzzle clearer. One of them, John Dalton, weighed the elements and arranged the puzzle by weight. German chemist Wolfgang Döbereiner later combined elements to see how they reacted with one another. What he found was that certain elements shared similar properties and reactions. For example, when pure lithium, sodium, and potassium are exposed to water, they will react violently and skid across the surface of the water with sparks. The scientists then realized that these similiarities are no coincidence: elements belong to families that share similar properties. But the chemist who finally put the puzzle together is Dmitri Mendeleev. He created cards of each known element and tried to order them based on atomic weight and their known properties. The story is that he stayed up 3 days and 3 nights, and he finally fell into a deep sleep and he dreamed about a table to order the elements. Mendeleev was not only able to create the periodic table, but he was able to predict elements that were not yet discovered. The puzzle of the periodic table of the elements was solved.

The elements that do not interact with other elements are easy to pin-point, while the ones who like to interact with others are difficult to find. Gold, silver, and copper are some of the choosier elements so we can find them easier. So let's fast forward to the late 1600's where Hennig Brand, a German alchemist, was busy working in his laboratory. Like many other alchemists of his time, Brand was trying to extract gold from the human body. Brand hit upon what he thought was the most obvious answer to his problem: urine. Urine is gold in coloration and could perhaps have gold in it. So, Brand collected as much urine as he possibly could, much of it being his own, then he decided to boil it down in hopes of obtaining gold. So Brand boiled his, well, urine, down until he collected a paste and heated the paste to a very high temperature. Eventually smoke appeared and the material burned brightly and violently. Brand had unknowingly isolated phosphorous from his urine. It was the first time anyone had discovered an element, but he didn't really understand what he had done. At the time of Brand, the concept of element had not been discovered. Instead ancient Greek principles of objects being composed of earth, water, air, and fire were predominant. It wasn't until the work of Antoine Lavoisier, who is now known as the father of chemistry, that science defined what an element was. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down by existing chemical means. Lavoisier created a list of the known elements of his time and tried to put the elements in some sort of order in which they could be classified, such as gases or metals. He was the first one to try to put the puzzle together. This was just the beginning of a means to organize the known elements of his time. Many other chemists then came along to make the puzzle clearer. One of them, John Dalton, weighed the elements and arranged the puzzle by weight. German chemist Wolfgang Döbereiner later combined elements to see how they reacted with one another. What he found was that certain elements shared similar properties and reactions. For example, when pure lithium, sodium, and potassium are exposed to water, they will react violently and skid across the surface of the water with sparks. The scientists then realized that these similiarities are no coincidence: elements belong to families that share similar properties. But the chemist who finally put the puzzle together is Dmitri Mendeleev. He created cards of each known element and tried to order them based on atomic weight and their known properties. The story is that he stayed up 3 days and 3 nights, and he finally fell into a deep sleep and he dreamed about a table to order the elements. Mendeleev was not only able to create the periodic table, but he was able to predict elements that were not yet discovered. The puzzle of the periodic table of the elements was solved.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Our Earth is a collection of puzzle pieces that make up the universe. In the vast darkness of space, the universe is lit by stars, which could one day become a supernova and create all the puzzle pieces that we know today as the elements. All elements were formed and released into space by exploding stars. For centuries, humans have tried to discover what makes up the world around them. Little did they know that all the pieces they needed were right under their noses. The discovery of these pieces revolutionized our understanding of the world and allowed for the creation of what might be the greatest gift to science: the periodic table. So, where are these elements, and how do we find a means to order them? Well, believe it or not, ancient civilizations were very much aware of many elements around them, but they did not identify them as the pieces of our universe. Elements like gold, silver, and copper were easily spotted by ancient cultures, and were used for multiple purposes like jewelry and tools. Why were these elements spotted so easily?

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What is a cartoon really? Many of us love cartoons, most of us grew up reading them or having them read to us. The fact is, cartoons have been around a long time. There are all kinds of cartoons: strip comics, comic books, political cartoons, single-panel cartoons, graphic novels, web comics, animation, caricature, there is something for everyone. No matter the form them come in, cartoons elicit all kinds of emotions from the viewer - happiness, sadness, anger, hilarity, calm - and can transmit ideas in an instant. Cartoons are a universal medium enjoyed and understood around the world and across borders. This is why they have survived so long as an art form. But how can a medium that is on the surface so simple have so much influence and at times be so meaningful? Let's look at what a cartoon is. It starts with an idea. The idea can be verbal, written in words, or it can be visual. A visual idea is simply a picture, a drawing, a doodle. These ideas come from a variety of places. Cartoonists might find the idea from observing life, reading a newspaper, trawling online. It can come from a sentence someone said or a single word heard on television. Cartoonists are like sponges; they soak up people, places, mannerisms, clothing, and behavior. Sometimes they might jot them down in a little black book that they carry around with them. Other times, it is just soaked up into the cartoonist's brain only to be squeezed out later when she is sitting at her drawing table. Not only does a cartoonist have to be aware of what she is seeing visually, but she has to listen to herself think. In other words, take the incoming information and select it, shape it, and then use it for a cartoon. Now that you have an idea, or something you think could be good for a cartoon, it's time to shape it. A cartoon is like a staged play. A cartoonist is playwright, director, stage designer, choreographer, and costume designer. A cartoon has characters, a set, dialogue, even if one line, and a backstory. The characters must be dressed to fit the idea, speak in a way that is natural and forwards the idea or gives the punchline. Nothing should be in the cartoon that is not absolutely necessary for the advancement of the idea. The image and words have to dance together in a way that makes sense. It could be a graceful dance, or an awkward dance, if that is part of the humor or idea. And then the execution. Some cartoonists sketch the idea with pencil then ink it with pen using a light box. Others visualize the image in their head and draw directly on the paper in pen. Different kinds of pens are used: felt-tip, mechanical pen, or a crow quill. Paper can be light-weight or heavy-bond. Many cartoonists add gray tone, called a wash, by using black watercolor and a brush. Others use a soft pencil for the tone. Color is usually created by using watercolor. A finished cartoon can then be scanned and adjusted, and the caption can be added on the computer with Photoshop. New technologies are emerging for the cartoonist's use in creating her cartoon. Photoshop can serve as a tool for color and image. Some may draw directly on a tablet with a stylus. The choices at this stage of creation work in tandem with the idea, and often when the final caption is added, it gets adjusted yet again. But, little is left to chance, except, perhaps, some of the watercolor. All these elements function in concert with one another. It's almost like a dance of words, ideas, and images that work together in order to make the cartoon a timeless, resilient work of art.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What analogy does Donnelly give to illustrate the many roles a cartoonist plays in developing a cartoon?
Options: A. A cartoon is like a garage. A cartoonist is mechanic, shop keeper, secretary, foreman, and inspection engineer., B. A cartoon is like a grocery store.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What is a cartoon really? Many of us love cartoons, most of us grew up reading them or having them read to us. The fact is, cartoons have been around a long time. There are all kinds of cartoons: strip comics, comic books, political cartoons, single-panel cartoons, graphic novels, web comics, animation, caricature, there is something for everyone. No matter the form them come in, cartoons elicit all kinds of emotions from the viewer - happiness, sadness, anger, hilarity, calm - and can transmit ideas in an instant. Cartoons are a universal medium enjoyed and understood around the world and across borders. This is why they have survived so long as an art form. But how can a medium that is on the surface so simple have so much influence and at times be so meaningful? Let's look at what a cartoon is. It starts with an idea. The idea can be verbal, written in words, or it can be visual. A visual idea is simply a picture, a drawing, a doodle. These ideas come from a variety of places. Cartoonists might find the idea from observing life, reading a newspaper, trawling online. It can come from a sentence someone said or a single word heard on television. Cartoonists are like sponges; they soak up people, places, mannerisms, clothing, and behavior. Sometimes they might jot them down in a little black book that they carry around with them. Other times, it is just soaked up into the cartoonist's brain only to be squeezed out later when she is sitting at her drawing table. Not only does a cartoonist have to be aware of what she is seeing visually, but she has to listen to herself think. In other words, take the incoming information and select it, shape it, and then use it for a cartoon. Now that you have an idea, or something you think could be good for a cartoon, it's time to shape it. A cartoon is like a staged play. A cartoonist is playwright, director, stage designer, choreographer, and costume designer. A cartoon has characters, a set, dialogue, even if one line, and a backstory. The characters must be dressed to fit the idea, speak in a way that is natural and forwards the idea or gives the punchline. Nothing should be in the cartoon that is not absolutely necessary for the advancement of the idea. The image and words have to dance together in a way that makes sense. It could be a graceful dance, or an awkward dance, if that is part of the humor or idea. And then the execution. Some cartoonists sketch the idea with pencil then ink it with pen using a light box. Others visualize the image in their head and draw directly on the paper in pen. Different kinds of pens are used: felt-tip, mechanical pen, or a crow quill. Paper can be light-weight or heavy-bond. Many cartoonists add gray tone, called a wash, by using black watercolor and a brush. Others use a soft pencil for the tone. Color is usually created by using watercolor. A finished cartoon can then be scanned and adjusted, and the caption can be added on the computer with Photoshop. New technologies are emerging for the cartoonist's use in creating her cartoon. Photoshop can serve as a tool for color and image. Some may draw directly on a tablet with a stylus. The choices at this stage of creation work in tandem with the idea, and often when the final caption is added, it gets adjusted yet again. But, little is left to chance, except, perhaps, some of the watercolor. All these elements function in concert with one another. It's almost like a dance of words, ideas, and images that work together in order to make the cartoon a timeless, resilient work of art.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It is only in the last 100 or so years that human kind has understood that the nucleus of the chemical elements is not always fixed. It can change spontaneously from one element to another. The name for this process is radioactivity. You probably already know something about the nucleus: it's much tinier than the atom, it's made of particles called protons and neutrons, there are electrons orbiting around it. And though the atoms can share or swap electrons when they bond together, the nuclei themselves never change. Right? Well, no. Certain nuclei are not stable in that way. This means they may change suddenly, spontaneously. The radioactive nucleus flings out a small particle and transforms into another element, just like that. For example, the carbon nucleus can eject a fast-moving electron and turn into a nitrogen nucleus. There are two different particles that can be emitted from radioactive nuclei, but never together. The very fast electron is known as a beta particle. If you know a little bit about electrons, you may be thinking, "What was the electron doing in the nucleus in the first place?" The answer is there is a neutron in nucleus spontaneously changed into a proton, which stayed behind, and the electron flew out as a beta particle. This is not what chemistry has taught us to expect. The nucleus is supposed to be stable. Neutrons don't change into protons. Except, sometimes they do! The other particle it emits spontaneously from an unstable nucleus is alpha. An alpha particle is 8,000 times more massive than beta, and it's a bit slower. Alpha is made from two protons and two neutrons. If we trap all those alpha particles together, we get helium gas. Alpha is a helium nucleus. Like the beta particle, you would not have expected a heavier nucleus to throw out helium. But again, it happens, and the nucleus becomes a new element. So, is radioactivity useful or just dangerous? Wherever you are sitting, it is quite likely that there is a device nearby which contains a source of alpha particles: a smoke detector. The source is radioactive Americium. You are totally safe from these alpha particles, which cannot travel more than a few centimeters in air. Beta particles penetrate much farther through materials than alpha can. Radioactive atoms are used in medicine as traces, to show where chemicals travel in the patient. Beta particles are emitted and have enough energy to emerge from the body and be detected. There is a third type of nuclear radiation: gamma, which is not a particle at all. It is an electromagnetic wave, like microwaves, or light, but it is actually 1,000 times more energentic than visible light. Gamma rays may pass right through your body. Gamma is used to zap the bacteria in fruit to increase its shelf life, or in radiotherapy to kill cancer cells. Radioactive substances get hot, and this heat can be used to generate power. This heat has been brought to you since space probes, and, in the past, in pacemakers for hearts. The more abruptly nuclear radiation is slowed down, the more damage it does to the atoms it hits. This is called ionization. Alpha causes the most ionization as it crashes into other atoms and gamma the least. In humans, the most serious effect of radiation is the damage that it can cause to our DNA. Although alpha cannot penetrate your skin, if you inhale or injest a radioactive nucleus, the health consequences can be severe. Radioactivity is both useful and deadly, but it is all around us as a background to the natural world.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It is only in the last 100 or so years that human kind has understood that the nucleus of the chemical elements is not always fixed. It can change spontaneously from one element to another. The name for this process is radioactivity. You probably already know something about the nucleus: it's much tinier than the atom, it's made of particles called protons and neutrons, there are electrons orbiting around it. And though the atoms can share or swap electrons when they bond together, the nuclei themselves never change. Right? Well, no. Certain nuclei are not stable in that way. This means they may change suddenly, spontaneously. The radioactive nucleus flings out a small particle and transforms into another element, just like that. For example, the carbon nucleus can eject a fast-moving electron and turn into a nitrogen nucleus. There are two different particles that can be emitted from radioactive nuclei, but never together. The very fast electron is known as a beta particle. If you know a little bit about electrons, you may be thinking, "What was the electron doing in the nucleus in the first place?" The answer is there is a neutron in nucleus spontaneously changed into a proton, which stayed behind, and the electron flew out as a beta particle. This is not what chemistry has taught us to expect. The nucleus is supposed to be stable. Neutrons don't change into protons. Except, sometimes they do! The other particle it emits spontaneously from an unstable nucleus is alpha. An alpha particle is 8,000 times more massive than beta, and it's a bit slower. Alpha is made from two protons and two neutrons. If we trap all those alpha particles together, we get helium gas. Alpha is a helium nucleus. Like the beta particle, you would not have expected a heavier nucleus to throw out helium. But again, it happens, and the nucleus becomes a new element. So, is radioactivity useful or just dangerous? Wherever you are sitting, it is quite likely that there is a device nearby which contains a source of alpha particles: a smoke detector. The source is radioactive Americium. You are totally safe from these alpha particles, which cannot travel more than a few centimeters in air.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Pretty much everyone loves eating pizza, but it can be a messy business. Pizza is soft and bendable. So how can you stop
all that cheese from falling off? You might know some tricks: you can use two hands --
not so classy, or you can use a paper plate and allow only the tip
of the pizza to peek out. There's one other trick, though: holding the crust, you can sort
of fold the slice down the middle. Now the tip of the pizza
isn't falling over, and you can eat it without getting
tomato sauce all over yourself or accidentally biting off
some of that paper plate. But why should the tip stay up
just because you bent the crust? To understand this,
you need to know two things: a little bit about the math
of curved shapes and a little about the physics
of thin sheets. First, the math. Suppose I have a flat sheet
made out of rubber. It's really thin and bendable,
so it's easy to roll into a cylinder. I don't need to stretch
the sheet at all, just bend it. This property where one shape
can be transformed into another without stretching or crumpling,
is called isometry. A mathematician would say that a flat
sheet is isometric to a cylinder. But not all shapes are isometric. If I try to turn my flat sheet
into part of a sphere, there's no way I can do it. You can check this for yourself, by trying to fit a flat sheet
of paper onto a soccer ball without stretching or crumpling the paper. It's just not possible. So a mathematician would say that a flat sheet and a sphere
aren't isometric. There's one more familiar
shape that isn't isometric to any of the shapes we've seen
so far: a potato chip. Potato chip shapes
aren't isometric to flat sheets. If you want to get a flat piece of rubber
into the shape of a potato chip, you need to stretch it --
not just bend it, but stretch it as well. So, that's the math. Not so hard, right? Now for the physics. It can be summed up in one sentence: Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. This is really important. Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. Remember when we rolled
our flat sheet of rubber into a cylinder? That wasn't hard, right? But imagine how hard
you'd have pull on the sheet to increase its area by 10 percent. It would be pretty difficult. The point is that bending a thin sheet takes a relatively small amount of force, but stretching or crumbling
a thin sheet is much harder. Now, finally, we get to talk about pizza. Suppose you go down to the pizzeria
and buy yourself a slice. You pick it up from the crust,
first, without doing the fold. Because of gravity,
the slice bends downwards. Pizza is pretty thin, after all, and we know that thin sheets
are easy to bend. You can't get it in your mouth, cheese and tomato sauce dripping
everywhere -- it's a big mess. So you fold the crust. When you do, you force the pizza
into something like a taco shape. That's not hard to do --
after all, this shape is isometric to the original pizza, which was flat. But imagine what would happen
if the pizza were to droop down while you're bending it. Now it looks like a droopy taco. And what does a droopy taco
look like? A potato chip! But we know that potato chips are not
isometric to flat pieces of rubber or flat pizzas, and that means that in order
to get into the shape it's in now, the slice of pizza had to stretch. Since the pizza is thin,
this takes a lot of force, compared to the amount of force it takes to bend the pizza in the first place. So, what's the conclusion? When you fold the pizza at the crust, you make it into a shape where a lot
of force is needed to bend the tip down. Often gravity isn't strong enough
to provide this force. That was kind of a lot of information, so let's do a quick backwards recap. When pizza is folded at the crust, gravity isn't strong enough
to bend the tip. Why? Because stretching a pizza is hard. And to bend the tip downwards,
the pizza would have to stretch, because the shape the pizza would be in, the droopy taco shape, isn't isometric
to the original flat pizza. Why? Because of math. As the pizza example shows,
we can learn a lot by looking at the mathematical properties
of different shapes. And it's especially nice when those shapes
happen to be pizza slices.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: To help understand why bending your pizza stops the tip from falling down, this lesson discussed

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Pretty much everyone loves eating pizza, but it can be a messy business. Pizza is soft and bendable. So how can you stop
all that cheese from falling off? You might know some tricks: you can use two hands --
not so classy, or you can use a paper plate and allow only the tip
of the pizza to peek out. There's one other trick, though: holding the crust, you can sort
of fold the slice down the middle. Now the tip of the pizza
isn't falling over, and you can eat it without getting
tomato sauce all over yourself or accidentally biting off
some of that paper plate. But why should the tip stay up
just because you bent the crust? To understand this,
you need to know two things: a little bit about the math
of curved shapes and a little about the physics
of thin sheets. First, the math. Suppose I have a flat sheet
made out of rubber. It's really thin and bendable,
so it's easy to roll into a cylinder. I don't need to stretch
the sheet at all, just bend it. This property where one shape
can be transformed into another without stretching or crumpling,
is called isometry. A mathematician would say that a flat
sheet is isometric to a cylinder. But not all shapes are isometric. If I try to turn my flat sheet
into part of a sphere, there's no way I can do it. You can check this for yourself, by trying to fit a flat sheet
of paper onto a soccer ball without stretching or crumpling the paper. It's just not possible. So a mathematician would say that a flat sheet and a sphere
aren't isometric. There's one more familiar
shape that isn't isometric to any of the shapes we've seen
so far: a potato chip. Potato chip shapes
aren't isometric to flat sheets. If you want to get a flat piece of rubber
into the shape of a potato chip, you need to stretch it --
not just bend it, but stretch it as well. So, that's the math. Not so hard, right? Now for the physics. It can be summed up in one sentence: Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. This is really important. Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch. Remember when we rolled
our flat sheet of rubber into a cylinder? That wasn't hard, right? But imagine how hard
you'd have pull on the sheet to increase its area by 10 percent. It would be pretty difficult. The point is that bending a thin sheet takes a relatively small amount of force, but stretching or crumbling
a thin sheet is much harder. Now, finally, we get to talk about pizza. Suppose you go down to the pizzeria
and buy yourself a slice. You pick it up from the crust,
first, without doing the fold. Because of gravity,
the slice bends downwards. Pizza is pretty thin, after all, and we know that thin sheets
are easy to bend. You can't get it in your mouth, cheese and tomato sauce dripping
everywhere -- it's a big mess. So you fold the crust. When you do, you force the pizza
into something like a taco shape. That's not hard to do --
after all, this shape is isometric to the original pizza, which was flat. But imagine what would happen
if the pizza were to droop down while you're bending it. Now it looks like a droopy taco. And what does a droopy taco
look like? A potato chip! But we know that potato chips are not
isometric to flat pieces of rubber or flat pizzas, and that means that in order
to get into the shape it's in now, the slice of pizza had to stretch. Since the pizza is thin,
this takes a lot of force, compared to the amount of force it takes to bend the pizza in the first place. So, what's the conclusion? When you fold the pizza at the crust, you make it into a shape where a lot
of force is needed to bend the tip down. Often gravity isn't strong enough
to provide this force. That was kind of a lot of information, so let's do a quick backwards recap. When pizza is folded at the crust, gravity isn't strong enough
to bend the tip. Why? Because stretching a pizza is hard. And to bend the tip downwards,
the pizza would have to stretch, because the shape the pizza would be in, the droopy taco shape, isn't isometric
to the original flat pizza. Why? Because of math. As the pizza example shows,
we can learn a lot by looking at the mathematical properties
of different shapes. And it's especially nice when those shapes
happen to be pizza slices.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We all start life as one single cell. Then that cell divides and we are two cells, then four, then eight. Cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form us. These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell to 100 trillion cells, are called growth. And growth seems like a simple thing because when we think of it, we typically think of someone getting taller or, later in life, wider, but to cells, growth isn't simple. Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that's part individual, part community-driven. And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells, some times things go wrong. Maybe an individual cell's set of instructions, or DNA, gets a typo, what we call a mutation. Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes and shuts itself down, or the system detects a troublemaker and eliminates it. But, enough mutations can bypass the fail-safes, driving the cell to divide recklessly. That one rogue cell becomes two, then four, then eight. At every stage, the incorrect instructions are passed along to the cells' offspring. Weeks, months, or years after that one rogue cell transformed, you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast. Difficulty going to the bathroom could reveal a problem in your intestine, prostate, or bladder. Or, a routine blood test might count too many white cells or elevated liver enzymes. Your doctor delivers the bad news: it's cancer. From here your strategy will depend on where the cancer is and how far it's progressed. If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place, surgery might be all you need, if anything. If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue, your doctor might recommend radiation or surgery followed by radiation. If the cancer has spread, or if it's inherently everywhere like a leukemia, your doctor will most likely recommend chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemo. Radiation and most forms of chemo work by physically shredding the cells' DNA or disrupting the copying machinery. But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells. Radiation hits whatever you point it at, and your blood stream carries chemo-therapeutics all over your body. So, what happens when different cells get hit? Let's look at a healthy liver cell, a healthy hair cell, and a cancerous cell. The healthy liver cell divides only when it is stressed; the healthy hair cell divides frequently; and the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. When you take a chemotherapeutic drug, it will hit all of these cells. And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division. So, every time a cell divides, it opens itself up to attack, and that means the more frequently a cell divides, the more likely the drug is to kill it. So, remember that hair cell? It divides frequently and isn't a threat. And, there are other frequently dividing cells in your body like skin cells, gut cells, and blood cells. So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallels these tissue types: hair loss, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, and pain. That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest. So, in the end, it is all about growth. Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery and forces them to put the pedal to the metal, growing rapidly and recklessly. But, using chemotherapeutic drugs, we take advantage of that aggressiveness, and we turn cancer's main strength into a weakness.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We all start life as one single cell. Then that cell divides and we are two cells, then four, then eight. Cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form us. These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell to 100 trillion cells, are called growth. And growth seems like a simple thing because when we think of it, we typically think of someone getting taller or, later in life, wider, but to cells, growth isn't simple. Cell division is an intricate chemical dance that's part individual, part community-driven. And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells, some times things go wrong. Maybe an individual cell's set of instructions, or DNA, gets a typo, what we call a mutation. Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes and shuts itself down, or the system detects a troublemaker and eliminates it. But, enough mutations can bypass the fail-safes, driving the cell to divide recklessly. That one rogue cell becomes two, then four, then eight. At every stage, the incorrect instructions are passed along to the cells' offspring. Weeks, months, or years after that one rogue cell transformed, you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast. Difficulty going to the bathroom could reveal a problem in your intestine, prostate, or bladder. Or, a routine blood test might count too many white cells or elevated liver enzymes. Your doctor delivers the bad news: it's cancer. From here your strategy will depend on where the cancer is and how far it's progressed. If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place, surgery might be all you need, if anything. If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue, your doctor might recommend radiation or surgery followed by radiation. If the cancer has spread, or if it's inherently everywhere like a leukemia, your doctor will most likely recommend chemotherapy or a combination of radiation and chemo. Radiation and most forms of chemo work by physically shredding the cells' DNA or disrupting the copying machinery. But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells. Radiation hits whatever you point it at, and your blood stream carries chemo-therapeutics all over your body. So, what happens when different cells get hit? Let's look at a healthy liver cell, a healthy hair cell, and a cancerous cell. The healthy liver cell divides only when it is stressed; the healthy hair cell divides frequently; and the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly. When you take a chemotherapeutic drug, it will hit all of these cells. And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division. So, every time a cell divides, it opens itself up to attack, and that means the more frequently a cell divides, the more likely the drug is to kill it. So, remember that hair cell? It divides frequently and isn't a threat. And, there are other frequently dividing cells in your body like skin cells, gut cells, and blood cells. So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment parallels these tissue types: hair loss, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, and pain. That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest. So, in the end, it is all about growth. Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery and forces them to put the pedal to the metal, growing rapidly and recklessly. But, using chemotherapeutic drugs, we take advantage of that aggressiveness, and we turn cancer's main strength into a weakness.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why doesn't cancer just die off after one rogue division?
Options: A. Cancer cells are part of a group of cells that are invisible to the body's defense mechanisms, these cells are collectively called celluloinvisibilis, B. Cancer cells spontaneously form as a group of cells that attack white blood cells, from the beginning, and are too powerful for the body's natural defense mechanisms, C. Cancer can disguise itself as a normal cell and always does so until it is in a stage of maturity known as cellular adolescenze, D. Most of the time, a cell detects a glitch and shuts itself down, or the system detects a troublemaker and eliminates it, but sometimes enough mutations pass the failsafes, and cancer cells divide recklessly
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What happens when a cell's DNA contains a mutation that bypasses the fail-safes, leading to uncontrolled cell division?
Options: A. The cell becomes dormant, B. The cell divides recklessly, passing incorrect instructions to its offspring, C. The cell undergoes apoptosis, D. The cell becomes a specialized cell
Correct Option: B

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why are chemotherapeutic drugs generally successful against cancer cells?

Chemotherapy attacks only cells that appear to have a mutation (meaning that the majority of healthy body cells are unaffected, but the majority of cancer cells are eliminated), C. Chemotherapy attacks every cell in the body, but cells that divide more frequently are most susceptible (that's why cancer cells are hit the hardest -- they divide so frequently and randomly), D. Chemotherapy is not generally successful and is usually held as a last resort for patients who have exhausted other treatment options
Correct Option: C

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let's talk about the facts of life. You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid about sex or drugs with your parents or some trusted adult? Probably not because it's a myth. You don't talk to kids about that stuff. It's just so embarrassing. And, hey, maybe that's OK. We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades. We spend billions of dollars on it. So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV? I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan: "This is drugs, and this is your brain on drugs. Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff. Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol, and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined. But, nevermind, it's legal. So we declared war on drugs! Nancy Reagan was our general. All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!" Just say, "No!" to pot. Just say, "No!" to cocaine. Just say, "No!" to everything. So simple! If you want to save kids, you have to scare the hell out of them! And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that. Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex. We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS. And when all the data finally came home, guess what: completely ineffective. We love big solutions to big problems, don't we? What if the facts of life don't work that way? What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced? What if it can't be scaled up? Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it? And, many of them are really trying to help. Who, then? Us. We have to talk to kids. Openly and honestly. But are we ready to be honest? I don't think so. We mythologize childhood. Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a completely typical 1980's American suburb. For the parents, a wholesome paradise of bridge parties and tennis games. For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project, and our laboratory was in the woods after school, under the covers during sleep-overs, really, any opportunity we could take to peel off our clothes and investigate. What were these things, bodies? What do they do? We had to figure them out and that's childhood. It's not just fun and games, it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness. And then you walk into your first class in middle school, and the bomb goes off. You are not just a body any more. Oh no, now you are grotesque. That's when the suffering really starts. So, yeah, talk to kids. But if you are not honest about your own experiences first, everything you say smells like bullshit. Don't worry, you can practice and you should start by talking to the one kid you definitely know: you. What kind of kid were you? What troubled you? For me, it was age 13. That was the worst year. I was obsessively curious about sex and also deeply ashamed by it. It wasn't my only problem, of course, not by a long shot, but it was the beginning of a downward spiral. And my bad luck was to hit bottom while watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, which is a bad idea for a miserable 13-year old high on weed. So, that night, for whatever reason, it seemed like good idea to shave off my eyebrows, and then try to kill myself by swallowing all the pills in the bathroom, which was not at all fatal, but everyone noticed the eyebrows. And that made middle school extra fun. So, what was your low point? And if you could build a time machine to travel back and talk to that kid, what would you say to yourself? For me, it was easy. All I really needed was someone to reassure me that somehow I was a normal part of the universe. But I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. And yet weirdly, I fully expected a time traveler to materialize at any time because I was a geek. I didn't know if it would be my unborn son or a T-101 cyborg. But either one would be awesome! Hey, it's me, yourself from the future, in the year 2012. I have crucial information for you, but not about the future, about the past, a billion years in the past, when this planet was covered with nothing but cells and all they did was fight, eat, and divide; fight, eat, and divide. Except for one. And that's your ancestor. This cell enslaved other ones, but master and slave became one. And then those cells invented sex, and then they invented the first bodies with each cell doing a different job, some smelling, some moving, some eating. And the job of sex went to a special cell called the gamete. And those bodies became giant. The distance to the next body was vast so they had to swim. Most would be lost and die so they were mass-produced. Soon the oceans were a non-stop riot of sex and death until 500 million years ago, when the first beast crawled onto land. Land is hard because bodies are heavy. And the sun kills gametes. To keep them safe, so deep inside of a body, the mother builds a tiny ocean. Outside are events of unimaginable violence. Whole new forms of life are being created only to be wiped away. Millions of years are flashing by. But in here, it's always the same. Peace. Just peace. Maybe we will never know why, but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet, it was this one, bilaterally symmetric, warm-blooded, bigger than a mouse, smaller than a horse, 2 legs, 10 toes, no tail, big brain, language, technology, and civilization rising and falling for thousands of years. And here you are, a 13-year old human perplexed and embarrassed about sex. That's what I came here to tell you: we don't know why sex evolved nor why it persists. Why don't we just clone ourselves like all life did a billion years ago? It's so much more efficient. We would all have babies, no mates. It could be that children who are genetically different from each other are protected from disease. And that is still our best guess. So be comforted to know that even in the distant future, in the year 2012, we still don't know what sex is for. It is perplexing. You shouldn't be embarrassed by it. Sex is a beautiful puzzle. And without it, you simply would not be here. By the way, be nice to your little sister. She's your best friend. You'll see.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let's talk about the facts of life. You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid about sex or drugs with your parents or some trusted adult? Probably not because it's a myth. You don't talk to kids about that stuff. It's just so embarrassing. And, hey, maybe that's OK. We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades. We spend billions of dollars on it. So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV? I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan: "This is drugs, and this is your brain on drugs. Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff. Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol, and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined. But, nevermind, it's legal. So we declared war on drugs! Nancy Reagan was our general. All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!" Just say, "No!" to pot. Just say, "No!" to cocaine. Just say, "No!" to everything. So simple! If you want to save kids, you have to scare the hell out of them! And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that. Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex. We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS. And when all the data finally came home, guess what: completely ineffective. We love big solutions to big problems, don't we? What if the facts of life don't work that way? What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced? What if it can't be scaled up? Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it? And, many of them are really trying to help. Who, then? Us. We have to talk to kids. Openly and honestly. But are we ready to be honest? I don't think so. We mythologize childhood. Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a completely typical 1980's American suburb.

And my bad luck was to hit bottom while watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, which is a bad idea for a miserable 13-year old high on weed. So, that night, for whatever reason, it seemed like good idea to shave off my eyebrows, and then try to kill myself by swallowing all the pills in the bathroom, which was not at all fatal, but everyone noticed the eyebrows. And that made middle school extra fun. So, what was your low point? And if you could build a time machine to travel back and talk to that kid, what would you say to yourself? For me, it was easy. All I really needed was someone to reassure me that somehow I was a normal part of the universe. But I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. And yet weirdly, I fully expected a time traveler to materialize at any time because I was a geek. I didn't know if it would be my unborn son or a T-101 cyborg. But either one would be awesome! Hey, it's me, yourself from the future, in the year 2012. I have crucial information for you, but not about the future, about the past, a billion years in the past, when this planet was covered with nothing but cells and all they did was fight, eat, and divide; fight, eat, and divide. Except for one. And that's your ancestor. This cell enslaved other ones, but master and slave became one. And then those cells invented sex, and then they invented the first bodies with each cell doing a different job, some smelling, some moving, some eating. And the job of sex went to a special cell called the gamete. And those bodies became giant. The distance to the next body was vast so they had to swim. Most would be lost and die so they were mass-produced. Soon the oceans were a non-stop riot of sex and death until 500 million years ago, when the first beast crawled onto land. Land is hard because bodies are heavy. And the sun kills gametes. To keep them safe, so deep inside of a body, the mother builds a tiny ocean. Outside are events of unimaginable violence. Whole new forms of life are being created only to be wiped away. Millions of years are flashing by. But in here, it's always the same. Peace. Just peace. Maybe we will never know why, but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet, it was this one, bilaterally symmetric, warm-blooded, bigger than a mouse, smaller than a horse, 2 legs, 10 toes, no tail, big brain, language, technology, and civilization rising and falling for thousands of years. And here you are, a 13-year old human perplexed and embarrassed about sex. That's what I came here to tell you: we don't know why sex evolved nor why it persists. Why don't we just clone ourselves like all life did a billion years ago? It's so much more efficient. We would all have babies, no mates. It could be that children who are genetically different from each other are protected from disease. And that is still our best guess. So be comforted to know that even in the distant future, in the year 2012, we still don't know what sex is for. It is perplexing. You shouldn't be embarrassed by it. Sex is a beautiful puzzle. And without it, you simply would not be here. By the way, be nice to your little sister. She's your best friend. You'll see.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Let's talk about the facts of life. You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid about sex or drugs with your parents or some trusted adult? Probably not because it's a myth. You don't talk to kids about that stuff. It's just so embarrassing. And, hey, maybe that's OK. We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades. We spend billions of dollars on it. So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV? I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan: "This is drugs, and this is your brain on drugs. Pssssssss. Any questions?" Yeah, actually, I did. But it's not about questions. It's about data. In the 1980's when I was growing up, those data were terrifying parents: 1% of high school seniors had try heroin, 12% hallucinogens, 12% tranquilizers, 17% cocaine, 26% stimulants, and over 50% of us had tried marijuana. It was an epidemic! At least, that's what they told us. And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff. Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol, and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined. But, nevermind, it's legal. So we declared war on drugs! Nancy Reagan was our general. All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!" Just say, "No!" to pot. Just say, "No!" to cocaine. Just say, "No!" to everything. So simple! If you want to save kids, you have to scare the hell out of them! And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that. Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex. We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS. And when all the data finally came home, guess what: completely ineffective. We love big solutions to big problems, don't we? What if the facts of life don't work that way? What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced? What if it can't be scaled up? Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it? And, many of them are really trying to help. Who, then? Us. We have to talk to kids. Openly and honestly. But are we ready to be honest? I don't think so. We mythologize childhood. Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a completely typical 1980's American suburb. For the parents, a wholesome paradise of bridge parties and tennis games. For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project, and our laboratory was in the woods after school, under the covers during sleep-overs, really, any opportunity we could take to peel off our clothes and investigate. What were these things, bodies? What do they do? We had to figure them out and that's childhood. It's not just fun and games, it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness. And then you walk into your first class in middle school, and the bomb goes off. You are not just a body any more. Oh no, now you are grotesque. That's when the suffering really starts. So, yeah, talk to kids. But if you are not honest about your own experiences first, everything you say smells like bullshit. Don't worry, you can practice and you should start by talking to the one kid you definitely know: you. What kind of kid were you? What troubled you? For me, it was age 13. That was the worst year. I was obsessively curious about sex and also deeply ashamed by it. It wasn't my only problem, of course, not by a long shot, but it was the beginning of a downward spiral.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar In Physics, the concepts of work and power help us understand and explain lots of things in our universe. Let's start with work. Positive work is the energy we put into a system, and negative work is energy that is transferred out. Think of positive work as money being added to your bank account, and negative work as money taken out. In the metric system, work and energy are measured in Joules. As an example, let's take a beautiful, old, mechanical grandfather clock. We transfer energy into the clock when we turn the crank to raise the heavy metal cylinders inside the clock. When we do this, we are doing positive work, adding energy to the clock, and that energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. We can calculate the amount of work done by multiplying the force we apply times the distance over which we apply the force. To raise the metal cylinders, we need to apply a force equal to their weight. That is, equal to the force of gravity pulling downward on the cylinders. These cylinders weight 300 Newtons, which is pretty heavy, about as much as a small child, and if we lift them 1/2 meter, then we do 300 Newtons times 1/2 meter or 150 Joules of work. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred. When we say rate, we mean the amount of energy transferred per unit of time. In the metric system, power is measured in Joules per second, or Watts. The term Watt goes back to James Watt, who came up with the concept of horsepower to measure the amount of power produced by a typical work horse. James Watt was a producer of industrial steam engines, and he wanted his potential customers to be able to make comparisons between his steam engines and a familiar quanity, the power they could get from a working horse. It was such a useful idea that the metric system unit for power, the Watt, is named after James Watt. Following in James Watt's footsteps, let's compare the amount of power it takes to run this grandfather clock to the power we'd need to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. We can measure the power a person uses to wind the clock by dividing the amount of work they did by the time it took them to do it. If it takes 1 minute, or 60 seconds, to lift the weights, then they are doing 150 Joules divided by 60 seconds, or 2.5 Joules per second of work. They are adding energy to the clock in the rate of 2.5 Watts. You would need about 40 times as much to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. Before we let the clock run, the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy of the cylinders. It's like your bank account when you have just deposited money. But if we let the clock run, the cylinders slowly move downward. Energy is leaving the clock. In fact, when the cylinders get to the bottom, all the energy that we put in will have left. So how much power does the clock use? That is, how many Joules of energy per second leave the clock if it takes 5 days for the cylinders to return to their original position? We can figure this out because we already know how much work we did when we lifted the cylinders: 150 Joules. But this time, it took 5 days rather than a minute. Five days is 5 times 24 times 60 times 60 again or 432,000 seconds. So we divide the work done by the time and find the answer of about 0.00035 Joules per second, or about 0.35 milliwatts. That's a tiny amount of power. This clock uses so little power that you could run almost 300,000 clocks using the same power it takes to run one 100-Watt light bulb. That's right, you could run a clock in every house in a medium sized city with that much power. That's a pretty amazing conclusion and it took knowledge of work and power to figure it out.

As an example, let's take a beautiful, old, mechanical grandfather clock. We transfer energy into the clock when we turn the crank to raise the heavy metal cylinders inside the clock. When we do this, we are doing positive work, adding energy to the clock, and that energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. We can calculate the amount of work done by multiplying the force we apply times the distance over which we apply the force. To raise the metal cylinders, we need to apply a force equal to their weight. That is, equal to the force of gravity pulling downward on the cylinders. These cylinders weight 300 Newtons, which is pretty heavy, about as much as a small child, and if we lift them 1/2 meter, then we do 300 Newtons times 1/2 meter or 150 Joules of work. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred. When we say rate, we mean the amount of energy transferred per unit of time. In the metric system, power is measured in Joules per second, or Watts. The term Watt goes back to James Watt, who came up with the concept of horsepower to measure the amount of power produced by a typical work horse. James Watt was a producer of industrial steam engines, and he wanted his potential customers to be able to make comparisons between his steam engines and a familiar quanity, the power they could get from a working horse. It was such a useful idea that the metric system unit for power, the Watt, is named after James Watt. Following in James Watt's footsteps, let's compare the amount of power it takes to run this grandfather clock to the power we'd need to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. We can measure the power a person uses to wind the clock by dividing the amount of work they did by the time it took them to do it. If it takes 1 minute, or 60 seconds, to lift the weights, then they are doing 150 Joules divided by 60 seconds, or 2.5 Joules per second of work. They are adding energy to the clock in the rate of 2.5 Watts. You would need about 40 times as much to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb. Before we let the clock run, the energy is stored as gravitational potential energy of the cylinders. It's like your bank account when you have just deposited money. But if we let the clock run, the cylinders slowly move downward. Energy is leaving the clock. In fact, when the cylinders get to the bottom, all the energy that we put in will have left. So how much power does the clock use? That is, how many Joules of energy per second leave the clock if it takes 5 days for the cylinders to return to their original position? We can figure this out because we already know how much work we did when we lifted the cylinders: 150 Joules. But this time, it took 5 days rather than a minute. Five days is 5 times 24 times 60 times 60 again or 432,000 seconds. So we divide the work done by the time and find the answer of about 0.00035 Joules per second, or about 0.35 milliwatts. That's a tiny amount of power. This clock uses so little power that you could run almost 300,000 clocks using the same power it takes to run one 100-Watt light bulb. That's right, you could run a clock in every house in a medium sized city with that much power. That's a pretty amazing conclusion and it took knowledge of work and power to figure it out.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon as you're all aware we Face difficult Economic Times I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT he was struggling to explain something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter now he confused me from the very start because light doesn't cool things down it makes it hotter it's happening right now the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintilian photons and they're moving randomly through the space near the speed of light all of them are different colors they're Rippling with different frequencies and they're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here now a laser is different it also uses photons but they're all synchronized and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful tool the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye you can use it to store massive amounts of data and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain first you trap atoms in a special bottle it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment and the atoms themselves are quite violent but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens it's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas it enters a new state of matter called a super fluid the atoms lose their individual identity and the rules from the quantum World take over and that's what gives super fluids such spooky properties for example if you shine light through a super fluid it is able to slow photons down to 60 km per hour another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle it won't stay inside a thin film will creep up the inside wall flow over the top and right out the outside now of course the moment that it does hit the outside environment and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree it immediately turns back into normal matter super fluids are of the most fragile things we've ever discovered and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people I have a PhD in molecular biology I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the more he said the less I understood because if you're trying to to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its Essence the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all I remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds I started a contest four years ago called Dance your PhD instead of explaining their research with words some scien have to explain it with Dance Now surprisingly it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don't take my word for it go on the internet and search for Dance your PhD there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research for example at the University of Minnesota there's a biomedical engineer named David ODI and he works with dancers to study how cell cells move they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up one one side it triggers the cell to expanded shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers and those fibers are constantly falling part but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same now David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place it's basically efficient brainstorming and when I visited David to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method PowerPoint and this brings me to my Modest Proposal I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy now it does depend on how you measure it of course but one estimate has put the drain at $250 million per day now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of $35,000 and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day that would indeed add up to an annual waste of hundred billion dollar of course that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations there are other costs because PowerPoint is a tool and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country's CIA it helps you to soften up your audience it distracts them with pretty pictures irrelevant data it allows you to create the illusion of confidence the illusion of Simplicity and most destructively the illusion of understanding so now my country is $15 trillion in debt our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the Arts for example our National Endowment for the Arts with its $150 million budget slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about 1 1,000th of a percent one certainly can argue with those numbers however once we eliminate Public Funding for the Arts there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods all of this could Wipe Out the savings we're hoped to make we're hoping to make in the first place I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which I hope will not be liable to the least objection once we eliminate Public Funding for the artists let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint as a test case I propose we start with American dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our healthare system rather than dancing our phds we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank it's sure to help of course some someday in the Deep future a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric however I trust that by that day we shall it past this present Financial Calamity perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion [Music] for [Music] w

doesn't cool things down it makes it hotter it's happening right now the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintilian photons and they're moving randomly through the space near the speed of light all of them are different colors they're Rippling with different frequencies and they're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here now a laser is different it also uses photons but they're all synchronized and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful tool the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye you can use it to store massive amounts of data and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain first you trap atoms in a special bottle it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment and the atoms themselves are quite violent but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens it's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas it enters a new state of matter called a super fluid the atoms lose their individual identity and the rules from the quantum World take over and that's what gives super fluids such spooky properties for example if you shine light through a super fluid it is able to slow photons down to 60 km per hour another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle it won't stay inside a thin film will creep up the inside wall flow over the top and right out the outside now of course the moment that it does hit the outside environment and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree it immediately turns back into normal matter super fluids are of the most fragile things we've ever discovered and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people I have a PhD in molecular biology I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the more he said the less I understood because if you're trying to to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its Essence the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all I remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds I started a contest four years ago called Dance your PhD instead of explaining their research with words some scien have to explain it with Dance Now surprisingly it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don't take my word for it go on the internet and search for Dance your PhD there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research for example at the University of Minnesota there's a biomedical engineer named David ODI and he works with dancers to study how cell cells move they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up one one side it triggers the cell to expanded shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers and those fibers are constantly falling part but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same now David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place it's basically efficient brainstorming and when I visited David to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method PowerPoint and this brings me to my Modest Proposal I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy now it does depend on how you measure it of course but one estimate has put the drain at $250 million per day now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of $35,000 and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day that would indeed add up to an annual waste of hundred billion dollar of course that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations there are other costs because PowerPoint is a tool and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country's CIA it helps you to soften up your audience it distracts them with pretty pictures irrelevant data it allows you to create the illusion of confidence the illusion of Simplicity and most destructively the illusion of understanding so now my country is $15 trillion in debt our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the Arts for example our National Endowment for the Arts with its $150 million budget slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about 1 1,000th of a percent one certainly can argue with those numbers however once we eliminate Public Funding for the Arts there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods all of this could Wipe Out the savings we're hoped to make we're hoping to make in the first place I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which I hope will not be liable to the least objection once we eliminate Public Funding for the artists let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint as a test case I propose we start with American dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our healthare system rather than dancing our phds we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank it's sure to help of course some someday in the Deep future a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric however I trust that by that day we shall it past this present Financial Calamity perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion [Music] for [Music] w

the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people I have a PhD in molecular biology I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the more he said the less I understood because if you're trying to to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its Essence the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all I remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds I started a contest four years ago called Dance your PhD instead of explaining their research with words some scien have to explain it with Dance Now surprisingly it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don't take my word for it go on the internet and search for Dance your PhD there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research for example at the University of Minnesota there's a biomedical engineer named David ODI and he works with dancers to study how cell cells move they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up one one side it triggers the cell to expanded shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers and those fibers are constantly falling part but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same now David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place it's basically efficient brainstorming and when I visited David to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method PowerPoint and this brings me to my Modest Proposal I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy now it does depend on how you measure it of course but one estimate has put the drain at $250 million per day now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of $35,000 and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time and given that there are some apparently 30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day that would indeed add up to an annual waste of hundred billion dollar of course that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations there are other costs because PowerPoint is a tool and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country's CIA it helps you to soften up your audience it distracts them with pretty pictures irrelevant data it allows you to create the illusion of confidence the illusion of Simplicity and most destructively the illusion of understanding so now my country is $15 trillion in debt our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the Arts for example our National Endowment for the Arts with its $150 million budget slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about 1 1,000th of a percent one certainly can argue with those numbers however once we eliminate Public Funding for the Arts there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods all of this could Wipe Out the savings we're hoped to make we're hoping to make in the first place I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which I hope will not be liable to the least objection once we eliminate Public Funding for the artists let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint as a test case I propose we start with American dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our healthare system rather than dancing our phds we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank it's sure to help of course some someday in the Deep future a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric however I trust that by that day we shall it past this present Financial Calamity perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion [Music] for [Music] w

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I am going to start with a challenge. I want you to imagine each of these two scenes in as much detail as you can. Scene number one: "They gave us a hearty welcome." Well, who are the people who are giving a hearty welcome? What are they wearing? What are they drinking? OK, scene two: "They gave us a cordial reception." How are these people standing? What expressions are on their faces? What are they wearing and drinking? Fix these pictures in your mind's eye and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them. We'll come back to them later. Now on to our story. In the year 400 C.E. the Celts in Britain were ruled by Romans. This had one benefit for the Celts: the Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes of Northern Europe. But then the Roman Empire began to crumble, and the Romans withdrew from Britain. With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water, did away with the Celts, and formed kingdoms in the British Isles. For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon, became the common language, what we call Old English. Although modern English speakers may think Old English sounds like a different language, if you look and listen closely, you'll find many words that are recognizable. For example, here is what the Lord's Prayer looks like in Old English. At first glance, it may look unfamiliar, but update the spelling a bit, and you'll see many common English words. So the centuries passed with Britains happily speaking Old English, but in the 700's, a series of Viking invasions began, which continued until a treaty split the island in half. On one side were the Saxons. On the other side were the Danes who spoke a language called Old Norse. As Saxons fell in love with their cute Danish neighbors and marriages blurred the boundaries, Old Norse mixed with Old English, and many Old Norse words like freckle, leg, root, skin, and want are still a part of our language. 300 years later, in 1066, the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles. The Normans were Vikings who settled in France. They had abandoned the Viking language and culture in favor of a French lifestyle, but they still fought like Vikings. They placed a Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty. Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-speaking aristocracy and Old English-speaking peasants. The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them who added Latin words to the mix. Old English adapted and grew as thousands of words flowed in, many having to do with government, law, and aristocracy. Words like council, marriage, sovereign, govern, damage, and parliament. As the language expanded, English speakers quickly realized what to do if they wanted to sound sophisticated: they would use words that had come from French or Latin. Anglo Saxon words seemed so plain like the Anglo Saxon peasants who spoke them. Let's go back to the two sentences you thought about earlier. When you pictured the hearty welcome, did you see an earthy scene with relatives hugging and talking loudly? Were they drinking beer? Were they wearing lumberjack shirts and jeans? And what about the cordial reception? I bet you pictured a far more classy and refined crowd. Blazers and skirts, wine and caviar. Why is this? How is it that phrases that are considered just about synonymous by the dictionary can evoke such different pictures and feelings? "Hearty" and "welcome" are both Saxon words. "Cordial" and "reception" come from French. The connotation of nobility and authority has persisted around words of French origin. And the connotation of peasantry, real people, salt of the Earth, has persisted around Saxon words. Even if you never heard this history before, the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked by the words you speak. On some level, it's a story you already knew because whether we realize it consciously or only subconsciously, our history lives in the words we speak and hear.

The Normans were Vikings who settled in France. They had abandoned the Viking language and culture in favor of a French lifestyle, but they still fought like Vikings. They placed a Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty. Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-speaking aristocracy and Old English-speaking peasants. The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen with them who added Latin words to the mix. Old English adapted and grew as thousands of words flowed in, many having to do with government, law, and aristocracy. Words like council, marriage, sovereign, govern, damage, and parliament. As the language expanded, English speakers quickly realized what to do if they wanted to sound sophisticated: they would use words that had come from French or Latin. Anglo Saxon words seemed so plain like the Anglo Saxon peasants who spoke them. Let's go back to the two sentences you thought about earlier. When you pictured the hearty welcome, did you see an earthy scene with relatives hugging and talking loudly? Were they drinking beer? Were they wearing lumberjack shirts and jeans? And what about the cordial reception? I bet you pictured a far more classy and refined crowd. Blazers and skirts, wine and caviar. Why is this? How is it that phrases that are considered just about synonymous by the dictionary can evoke such different pictures and feelings? "Hearty" and "welcome" are both Saxon words. "Cordial" and "reception" come from French. The connotation of nobility and authority has persisted around words of French origin. And the connotation of peasantry, real people, salt of the Earth, has persisted around Saxon words. Even if you never heard this history before, the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked by the words you speak. On some level, it's a story you already knew because whether we realize it consciously or only subconsciously, our history lives in the words we speak and hear.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why are there so many words derived from Old French in modern English?

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I am going to start with a challenge. I want you to imagine each of these two scenes in as much detail as you can. Scene number one: "They gave us a hearty welcome." Well, who are the people who are giving a hearty welcome? What are they wearing? What are they drinking? OK, scene two: "They gave us a cordial reception." How are these people standing? What expressions are on their faces? What are they wearing and drinking? Fix these pictures in your mind's eye and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them. We'll come back to them later. Now on to our story. In the year 400 C.E. the Celts in Britain were ruled by Romans. This had one benefit for the Celts: the Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes of Northern Europe. But then the Roman Empire began to crumble, and the Romans withdrew from Britain. With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water, did away with the Celts, and formed kingdoms in the British Isles. For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon, became the common language, what we call Old English. Although modern English speakers may think Old English sounds like a different language, if you look and listen closely, you'll find many words that are recognizable. For example, here is what the Lord's Prayer looks like in Old English. At first glance, it may look unfamiliar, but update the spelling a bit, and you'll see many common English words. So the centuries passed with Britains happily speaking Old English, but in the 700's, a series of Viking invasions began, which continued until a treaty split the island in half. On one side were the Saxons. On the other side were the Danes who spoke a language called Old Norse. As Saxons fell in love with their cute Danish neighbors and marriages blurred the boundaries, Old Norse mixed with Old English, and many Old Norse words like freckle, leg, root, skin, and want are still a part of our language. 300 years later, in 1066, the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles. The Normans were Vikings who settled in France. They had abandoned the Viking language and culture in favor of a French lifestyle, but they still fought like Vikings. They placed a Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries, French was the language of the British royalty. Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-speaking aristocracy and Old English-speaking peasants.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every human being starts out the same way: two cells, one from each parent, found each other and became one. And that one cell reproduced itself, dividing, dividing and dividing until there were 10 trillion of them. Do you realize there's more cells
in one person's body than there are stars in the Milky Way? But those 10 trillion cells
aren't just sitting there in a big pile. That would make for a pretty
boring human being! So what is it that says a nose is a nose, and toes is toes? What is it that says this is bone and this is brain and this is heart and this is that little thing
in the back of your throat you can never remember the name of? Everything you are or ever will be made of starts as a tiny book of instructions found in each and every cell. Every time your body
wants to make something, it goes back to the instruction book, looks it up and puts it together. So how does one cell hold
all that information? Let's get small. I mean, really small --
smaller than the tip of a sewing needle. Then we can take a journey
inside a single cell to find out what makes up the book of you, your genome. The first thing we see
is that the whole genome, all your DNA, is contained inside
its own tiny compartment, called the nucleus. If we stretched out all the DNA
in this one cell into a single thread, it would be over 3 feet long! We have to make it fit
in a tiny compartment that's a million times smaller. We could just bunch it up
like Christmas lights, but that could get messy. We need some organization. First, the long thread of DNA
wraps around proteins clustered into little beads
called nucleosomes, which end up looking
like a long, beaded necklace. And that necklace
is wrapped up in its own spiral, like an old telephone cord. And those spirals get layered
on top of one another until we get a neat little shape
that fits inside the nucleus. Voilà! Three feet of DNA
squeezed into a tiny compartment. If only we could hire DNA
to pack our suitcases! Each tiny mass of DNA
is called a chromosome. The book of you would have 46 chapters, one for each chromosome. Twenty-three chapters of your book
came from your mom, and 23 chapters came from your dad. Two of those chapters, called "X" and "Y," determine if you're male, "XY," or female, "XX." Put them together, and we get two almost identical but slightly
different sets of 23 chapters. The tiny variations are what makes
each person different. It's estimated
that all the chapters together hold about 20,000 individual
instructions, called genes. Written out, all those 20,000 instructions are 30 million letters long! If someone were writing
one letter per second, it would take them almost
an entire year to write it once. It turns out that our genome book
is much, much longer than just those 30 million letters -- almost 100 times longer! What are all those extra pages for? Well, each page of instructions
has a few pages of nonsense inserted that have to be taken out
before we end up with something useful. The parts we throw out, we call introns. The instructions we keep, we call exons. We can also have hundreds
of pages in between each gene. Some of these excess pages were inserted by nasty little infections
in our ancestors, but some of them are actually helpful. They protect the ends of each chapter
from being damaged, or some help our cells find
a particular thing they're looking for, or give a cell a signal
to stop making something. All in all, for every page
of instructions, there's almost 100 pages of filler. In the end, each of our books' 46 chapters is between 48 and 250
million letters long. That's 3.2 billion letters total! To type all that copy, you'd be at it for over 100 years, and the book would be
over 600,000 pages long. Every type of cell carries the same book, but each has a set of bookmarks that tell it exactly which pages
it needs to look up. So a bone cell reads only the set
of instructions it needs to become bone. Your brain cells, they read the set that tells them
how to become brain. If some cells suddenly decide
to start reading other instructions, they can actually change
from one type to another. So every little cell in your body
is holding on to an amazing book, full of the instructions for life. Your nose reads nose pages, your toes read toes pages. And that little thing
in the back of your throat? It's got its own pages, too. They're under "uvula."

from being damaged, or some help our cells find
a particular thing they're looking for, or give a cell a signal
to stop making something. All in all, for every page
of instructions, there's almost 100 pages of filler. In the end, each of our books' 46 chapters is between 48 and 250
million letters long. That's 3.2 billion letters total! To type all that copy, you'd be at it for over 100 years, and the book would be
over 600,000 pages long. Every type of cell carries the same book, but each has a set of bookmarks that tell it exactly which pages
it needs to look up. So a bone cell reads only the set
of instructions it needs to become bone. Your brain cells, they read the set that tells them
how to become brain. If some cells suddenly decide
to start reading other instructions, they can actually change
from one type to another. So every little cell in your body
is holding on to an amazing book, full of the instructions for life. Your nose reads nose pages, your toes read toes pages. And that little thing
in the back of your throat? It's got its own pages, too. They're under "uvula."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Every human being starts out the same way: two cells, one from each parent, found each other and became one. And that one cell reproduced itself, dividing, dividing and dividing until there were 10 trillion of them. Do you realize there's more cells
in one person's body than there are stars in the Milky Way? But those 10 trillion cells
aren't just sitting there in a big pile. That would make for a pretty
boring human being! So what is it that says a nose is a nose, and toes is toes? What is it that says this is bone and this is brain and this is heart and this is that little thing
in the back of your throat you can never remember the name of? Everything you are or ever will be made of starts as a tiny book of instructions found in each and every cell. Every time your body
wants to make something, it goes back to the instruction book, looks it up and puts it together. So how does one cell hold
all that information? Let's get small. I mean, really small --
smaller than the tip of a sewing needle. Then we can take a journey
inside a single cell to find out what makes up the book of you, your genome. The first thing we see
is that the whole genome, all your DNA, is contained inside
its own tiny compartment, called the nucleus. If we stretched out all the DNA
in this one cell into a single thread, it would be over 3 feet long! We have to make it fit
in a tiny compartment that's a million times smaller. We could just bunch it up
like Christmas lights, but that could get messy. We need some organization. First, the long thread of DNA
wraps around proteins clustered into little beads
called nucleosomes, which end up looking
like a long, beaded necklace. And that necklace
is wrapped up in its own spiral, like an old telephone cord. And those spirals get layered
on top of one another until we get a neat little shape
that fits inside the nucleus. Voilà! Three feet of DNA
squeezed into a tiny compartment. If only we could hire DNA
to pack our suitcases! Each tiny mass of DNA
is called a chromosome. The book of you would have 46 chapters, one for each chromosome. Twenty-three chapters of your book
came from your mom, and 23 chapters came from your dad. Two of those chapters, called "X" and "Y," determine if you're male, "XY," or female, "XX." Put them together, and we get two almost identical but slightly
different sets of 23 chapters. The tiny variations are what makes
each person different. It's estimated
that all the chapters together hold about 20,000 individual
instructions, called genes. Written out, all those 20,000 instructions are 30 million letters long! If someone were writing
one letter per second, it would take them almost
an entire year to write it once. It turns out that our genome book
is much, much longer than just those 30 million letters -- almost 100 times longer! What are all those extra pages for? Well, each page of instructions
has a few pages of nonsense inserted that have to be taken out
before we end up with something useful. The parts we throw out, we call introns. The instructions we keep, we call exons. We can also have hundreds
of pages in between each gene. Some of these excess pages were inserted by nasty little infections

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, "eka" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back.

There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, "eka" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963.
