**Transcript**:
In 1861, two scientists got into
a very brainy argument. Specifically, they had opposing ideas
of how speech and memory operated within the human brain. Ernest Aubertin, 
with his localistic model, argued that a particular region
or the brain was devoted to each separate process. Pierre Gratiolet, on the other hand,
argued for the distributed model, where different regions work together to accomplish all of these 
various functions. The debate they began reverberated
throughout the rest of the century, involving some of the greatest scientific
minds of the time. Aubertin and his localistic model
had some big names on his side. In the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes
had assigned the quality of free will and the human soul
to the pineal gland. And in the late 18th century, a young
student named Franz Joseph Gall had observed that the best memorizers
in his class had the most prominent eyes and decided that this was due 
to higher development in the adjacent part of the brain. As a physician, Gall went on to establish
the study of phrenology, which held that strong mental faculties
corresponded to highly developed brain regions, observable
as bumps in the skull. The widespread popularity of phrenology
throughout the early 19th century tipped the scales towards 
Aubertin's localism. But the problem was that Gall had never
bothered to scientifically test whether the individual brain maps
he had constructed applied to all people. And in the 1840's, Pierre Flourens
challenged phrenology by selectively destroying parts
of animal brains and observing which functions were lost. Flourens found that damaging the cortex interfered with judgement or movement
in general, but failed to identify any region
associated with one specific function, concluding that the cortex carried out
brain functions as an entire unit. Flourens had scored a victory 
for Gratiolet, but it was not to last. Gall's former student, 
Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, challenged Flourens' conclusion, observing that patients 
with speech disorders all had damage to the frontal lobe. And after Paul Broca's 1861 autopsy of a
patient who had lost the power to produce speech, but not the power
to understand it, revealed highly localized 
frontal lobe damage, the distributed model seemed doomed. Localism took off. In the 1870's, Karl Wernicke associated
part of the left temporal lobe with speech comprehension. Soon after, Eduard Hitzig and 
Gustav Fritsch stimulated a dog's cortex and discovered
a frontal lobe region responsible for muscular movements. Building on their work, David Ferrier
mapped each piece of cortex associated with moving a part of the body. And in 1909, Korbinian Brodmann built
his own cortex map with 52 separate areas. It appeared that the victory of Aubertin's
localistic model was sealed. But neurologist Karl Wernicke had come up
with an interesting idea. He reasoned that since the regions for
speech production and comprehension were not adjacent, then injuring the area 
connecting them might result in a special type of language loss,
now known as receptive aphasia. Wernicke's connectionist model helped
explain disorders that didn't result from the dysfunction 
of just one area. Modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain
more complex than Gratiolet, Aubertin,
or even Wernicke imagined. Today, the hippocampus is associated
with two distinct brain functions: creating memories and processing
location in space. We also now measure 
two kinds of connectivity: anatomical connectivity between 
two adjoining regions of cortex working together, and functional connectivity 
between separated regions working together to
accomplish one process. A seemingly basic function like vision is actually composed 
of many smaller functions, with different parts 
of the cortex representing shape, color and location in space. When certain areas stop functioning,
we may recognize an object, but not see it, or vice versa. There are even different kinds of memory
for facts and for routines. And remembering something 
like your first bicycle involves a network of different regions
each representing the concept of vehicles, the bicycle's shape, 
the sound of the bell, and the emotions associated 
with that memory. In the end, both Gratiolet and Aubertin
turned out to be right. And we still use both of their models
to understand how cognition happens. For example, we can now measure brain
activity on such a fine time scale that we can see the individual localized
processes that comprise a single act of remembering. But it is the integration of these
different processes and regions that creates the coherent memory
we experience. The supposedly competing theories
prove to be two aspects of a more comprehensive model, which will in turn be revised and refined as our scientific techologies and methods
for understanding the brain improve.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about Gall's method of measuring bumps on the skull to determine a person's strongest and weakest brain functions, which is called phrenology.

The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but it is related to the topic of brain function and localization. However, one question mentions a related concept. 

Generated MCQ 2 is about Aubertin's localistic model, which is related to the idea of localized brain function that phrenology also touches upon. However, it does not directly mention phrenology.

A more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses phrenology or Gall's work. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of brain function and localization, I would say:

 Question 2

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and a more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses phrenology or Gall's work.

turned out to be right. And we still use both of their models

**Transcript**:
In 1861, two scientists got into
a very brainy argument. Specifically, they had opposing ideas
of how speech and memory operated within the human brain. Ernest Aubertin, 
with his localistic model, argued that a particular region
or the brain was devoted to each separate process. Pierre Gratiolet, on the other hand,
argued for the distributed model, where different regions work together to accomplish all of these 
various functions. The debate they began reverberated
throughout the rest of the century, involving some of the greatest scientific
minds of the time. Aubertin and his localistic model
had some big names on his side. In the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes
had assigned the quality of free will and the human soul
to the pineal gland. And in the late 18th century, a young
student named Franz Joseph Gall had observed that the best memorizers
in his class had the most prominent eyes and decided that this was due 
to higher development in the adjacent part of the brain. As a physician, Gall went on to establish
the study of phrenology, which held that strong mental faculties
corresponded to highly developed brain regions, observable
as bumps in the skull. The widespread popularity of phrenology
throughout the early 19th century tipped the scales towards 
Aubertin's localism. But the problem was that Gall had never
bothered to scientifically test whether the individual brain maps
he had constructed applied to all people. And in the 1840's, Pierre Flourens
challenged phrenology by selectively destroying parts
of animal brains and observing which functions were lost. Flourens found that damaging the cortex interfered with judgement or movement
in general, but failed to identify any region
associated with one specific function, concluding that the cortex carried out
brain functions as an entire unit. Flourens had scored a victory 
for Gratiolet, but it was not to last. Gall's former student, 
Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, challenged Flourens' conclusion, observing that patients 
with speech disorders all had damage to the frontal lobe. And after Paul Broca's 1861 autopsy of a
patient who had lost the power to produce speech, but not the power
to understand it, revealed highly localized 
frontal lobe damage, the distributed model seemed doomed. Localism took off. In the 1870's, Karl Wernicke associated
part of the left temporal lobe with speech comprehension. Soon after, Eduard Hitzig and 
Gustav Fritsch stimulated a dog's cortex and discovered
a frontal lobe region responsible for muscular movements. Building on their work, David Ferrier
mapped each piece of cortex associated with moving a part of the body. And in 1909, Korbinian Brodmann built
his own cortex map with 52 separate areas. It appeared that the victory of Aubertin's
localistic model was sealed. But neurologist Karl Wernicke had come up
with an interesting idea. He reasoned that since the regions for
speech production and comprehension were not adjacent, then injuring the area 
connecting them might result in a special type of language loss,
now known as receptive aphasia. Wernicke's connectionist model helped
explain disorders that didn't result from the dysfunction 
of just one area. Modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain
more complex than Gratiolet, Aubertin,
or even Wernicke imagined. Today, the hippocampus is associated
with two distinct brain functions: creating memories and processing
location in space. We also now measure 
two kinds of connectivity: anatomical connectivity between 
two adjoining regions of cortex working together, and functional connectivity 
between separated regions working together to
accomplish one process. A seemingly basic function like vision is actually composed 
of many smaller functions, with different parts 
of the cortex representing shape, color and location in space. When certain areas stop functioning,
we may recognize an object, but not see it, or vice versa. There are even different kinds of memory
for facts and for routines. And remembering something 
like your first bicycle involves a network of different regions
each representing the concept of vehicles, the bicycle's shape, 
the sound of the bell, and the emotions associated 
with that memory. In the end, both Gratiolet and Aubertin
turned out to be right. And we still use both of their models
to understand how cognition happens. For example, we can now measure brain
activity on such a fine time scale that we can see the individual localized
processes that comprise a single act of remembering. But it is the integration of these
different processes and regions that creates the coherent memory
we experience. The supposedly competing theories
prove to be two aspects of a more comprehensive model, which will in turn be revised and refined as our scientific techologies and methods
for understanding the brain improve.

**Transcript**:
Remember the time you fell off your bike
or bumped your head on a sharp corner? Childhood injuries are things
we'd often like to forget, but our bodies often carry the memories
in the form of scars. So what are these unwanted souvenirs
and why do we keep them for so long after that unintended vacation
to the emergency room? The most common place we see scars
are on our skin, a patch that looks slightly different
from the normal skin around it. Often, this is considered
an unfortunate disfigurement, while other times, deliberate
scarification has been used in both traditional and modern cultures,
to mark a rite of passage or simply for aesthetic decoration. But the difference isn't only cosmetic. When we look at healthy skin tissue
under a microscope, we see the cells that perform
various functions connected by an extracellular
matrix, or ECM. This is composed of structural proteins,
like collagen, secreted by specialized fibroblast cells. Well-arranged ECM allows for
transportation of nutrients, cell-to-cell communication,
and cell adhesion. But when a deep wound occurs,
this arrangement is disrupted. During the process of wound healing,
collagen is redeposited at the wound site, but instead of the basket-weave formation
found in healthy tissue, the new ECM is aligned
in a single direction, impeding inter-cell processes,
and reducing durability and elasticity. To make matters worse, the healed tissue contains
a higher proportion of ECM than before, reducing its overall function. In the skin, the overabundance of collagen
interferes with its original functions, like producing sweat, controlling body temperature and even growing hair. The scar tissue is fragile, sensitive
to changes in temperature and sensation, and should be kept in moist environments
to maximize healing. This presence of excessive
fibrous connective tissue in an organ is known as fibrosis,
and if that term sounds familiar, it's because our skin is not the only
organ vulnerable to scarring. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder
that causes scarring of the pancreas, while pulmonary fibrosis
is a scarring of the lungs, resulting in shortness of breath. Scarring of the heart and the buildup
of ECM following a heart attack can inhibit its beating,
leading to further heart problems. What's common to all these conditions is that although it retains some
of the original functions, the scar tissue formed after a wound is inferior to the native tissue
it replaces. However, there is hope. Medical researchers are now studying
what causes fibroblast cells to secrete excessive amounts of collagen and how we can recruit
the body's other cells in regenerating and repopulating
the damaged tissue. By learning how to better control wound
healing and the formation of scar tissue, we can utilize
the multi-billion-dollar budgets currently used to address
the aftermath of wounding in a much more efficient manner, and help millions of people live better
and healthier lives. But until then, at least some of our scars can help us remember to avoid
the sorts of things that cause them.

**Transcript**:
Remember the time you fell off your bike
or bumped your head on a sharp corner? Childhood injuries are things
we'd often like to forget, but our bodies often carry the memories
in the form of scars. So what are these unwanted souvenirs
and why do we keep them for so long after that unintended vacation
to the emergency room? The most common place we see scars
are on our skin, a patch that looks slightly different
from the normal skin around it. Often, this is considered
an unfortunate disfigurement, while other times, deliberate
scarification has been used in both traditional and modern cultures,
to mark a rite of passage or simply for aesthetic decoration. But the difference isn't only cosmetic. When we look at healthy skin tissue
under a microscope, we see the cells that perform
various functions connected by an extracellular
matrix, or ECM. This is composed of structural proteins,
like collagen, secreted by specialized fibroblast cells. Well-arranged ECM allows for
transportation of nutrients, cell-to-cell communication,
and cell adhesion. But when a deep wound occurs,
this arrangement is disrupted. During the process of wound healing,
collagen is redeposited at the wound site, but instead of the basket-weave formation
found in healthy tissue, the new ECM is aligned
in a single direction, impeding inter-cell processes,
and reducing durability and elasticity. To make matters worse, the healed tissue contains
a higher proportion of ECM than before, reducing its overall function. In the skin, the overabundance of collagen
interferes with its original functions, like producing sweat, controlling body temperature and even growing hair. The scar tissue is fragile, sensitive
to changes in temperature and sensation, and should be kept in moist environments
to maximize healing. This presence of excessive
fibrous connective tissue in an organ is known as fibrosis,
and if that term sounds familiar, it's because our skin is not the only
organ vulnerable to scarring. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder
that causes scarring of the pancreas, while pulmonary fibrosis
is a scarring of the lungs, resulting in shortness of breath. Scarring of the heart and the buildup
of ECM following a heart attack can inhibit its beating,
leading to further heart problems. What's common to all these conditions is that although it retains some
of the original functions, the scar tissue formed after a wound is inferior to the native tissue
it replaces. However, there is hope. Medical researchers are now studying
what causes fibroblast cells to secrete excessive amounts of collagen and how we can recruit
the body's other cells in regenerating and repopulating
the damaged tissue. By learning how to better control wound
healing and the formation of scar tissue, we can utilize
the multi-billion-dollar budgets currently used to address
the aftermath of wounding in a much more efficient manner, and help millions of people live better
and healthier lives. But until then, at least some of our scars can help us remember to avoid
the sorts of things that cause them.

**Transcript**:
The largest organ in your body
isn't your liver or your brain. It's your skin, with a surface area
of about 20 square feet in adults. Though different areas of the skin
have different characteristics, much of this surface performs
similar functions, such as sweating, feeling heat and cold,
and growing hair. But after a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different
from the surrounding area, and may not fully regain all 
its abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to
look at the structure of the human skin. The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly of hardened cells,
called keratinocytes, and provides protection. Since its outer layer is constantly being
shed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair. But sometimes a wound penetrates
into the dermis, which contains blood vessels
and the various glands and nerve endings that enable the skin's many functions. And when that happens, it triggers the
four overlapping stages of the regenerative process. The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's
response to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of 
the epidermis has been compromised. As the blood vessels tighten to minimize
the bleeding, in a process known as 
vasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming
a blood clot. A special protein known as fibrin forms
cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out
and bacteria or pathogens from getting in. After about three hours of this,
the skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation. With bleeding under control
and the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any
pathogens that may have gotten through. Among the most important of these
are white blood cells, known as macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue
through a process known as phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors
to spur healing. And because these tiny soldiers 
need to travel through the blood to 
get to the wound site, the previously constricted 
blood vessels now expand in a process called vasodilation. About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs, when 
fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound. In the process of collagen deposition, they produce a fibrous protein 
called collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue
to replace the fibrin from before. As epidermal cells divide to reform
the outer layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound. Finally, in the fourth stage 
of remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited
collagen is rearranged and converted into specific types. Through this process,
which can take over a year, the tensile strength of the new skin
is improved, and blood vessels and other connections
are strengthened. With time, the new tissue 
can reach from 50-80% of some of its original healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial 
wound and on the function itself. But because the skin
does not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical
issue for doctors around the world. And even though researchers have made
significant strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries
remain unresolved. For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive
from the blood vessels or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound? And why do some other mammals, 
such as deer, heal their wounds much more efficiently
and completely than humans? By finding the answers to these questions
and others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves
so well that scars will be just a memory.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 3: What is the name of the process by which the body prevents blood loss and maintains the physical barrier of the skin after a wound? Options: A. Vasoconstriction, B. Vasodilation, C. Hemostasis, D. Phagocytosis Correct Option: C

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the signal for the onset of the inflammation phase.

A closer match can be inferred from the content of Question 3 and the stages of the healing process described in the transcript. According to the transcript, the inflammation phase begins after about three hours of hemostasis, and it is signaled by the skin turning red.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the signal for the onset of the inflammation phase. However, based on the content and options provided, the closest match would be a question that mentions the stages of the healing process or the changes that occur during the inflammation phase.

Since there is no direct match, I will provide the index of the question that is closest to the topic:

 Question 3 is the closest, but it is not a direct match.

However, if I had to choose another question that might be related to the inflammation phase, I would suggest:

 Question 6: Which type of cells play a crucial role in fighting pathogens and infection during the healing process by devouring bacteria and damage tissue through phagocytosis? Options: A. Fibroblasts, B. Keratinocytes, C. White blood cells known as macrophages, D. Epidermal cells Correct Option: C

This question is related to the inflammation phase, as it mentions the cells that fight pathogens and infection during this stage. However, it does not directly ask about the signal for the onset of the inflammation phase.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

3 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

Or, if you'd like to consider Question 6 as a potential match:

6 (with the caveat that it's related to the inflammation phase but not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
The largest organ in your body
isn't your liver or your brain. It's your skin, with a surface area
of about 20 square feet in adults. Though different areas of the skin
have different characteristics, much of this surface performs
similar functions, such as sweating, feeling heat and cold,
and growing hair. But after a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different
from the surrounding area, and may not fully regain all 
its abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to
look at the structure of the human skin. The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly of hardened cells,
called keratinocytes, and provides protection. Since its outer layer is constantly being
shed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair. But sometimes a wound penetrates
into the dermis, which contains blood vessels
and the various glands and nerve endings that enable the skin's many functions. And when that happens, it triggers the
four overlapping stages of the regenerative process. The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's
response to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of 
the epidermis has been compromised. As the blood vessels tighten to minimize
the bleeding, in a process known as 
vasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming
a blood clot. A special protein known as fibrin forms
cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out
and bacteria or pathogens from getting in. After about three hours of this,
the skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation. With bleeding under control
and the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any
pathogens that may have gotten through. Among the most important of these
are white blood cells, known as macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue
through a process known as phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors
to spur healing. And because these tiny soldiers 
need to travel through the blood to 
get to the wound site, the previously constricted 
blood vessels now expand in a process called vasodilation. About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs, when 
fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound. In the process of collagen deposition, they produce a fibrous protein 
called collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue
to replace the fibrin from before. As epidermal cells divide to reform
the outer layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound. Finally, in the fourth stage 
of remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited
collagen is rearranged and converted into specific types. Through this process,
which can take over a year, the tensile strength of the new skin
is improved, and blood vessels and other connections
are strengthened. With time, the new tissue 
can reach from 50-80% of some of its original healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial 
wound and on the function itself. But because the skin
does not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical
issue for doctors around the world. And even though researchers have made
significant strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries
remain unresolved. For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive
from the blood vessels or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound? And why do some other mammals, 
such as deer, heal their wounds much more efficiently
and completely than humans? By finding the answers to these questions
and others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves
so well that scars will be just a memory.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as its options and content are not identical.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the process of previously constricted blood vessels expanding and includes the correct term "vasodilation" among its options.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the available options, I would suggest Question 3, as it does discuss a related concept (hemostasis) and includes vasoconstriction (the opposite of vasodilation) as one of its options.

**Transcript**:
Long before Descartes famously declared,
"I think, therefore I am," and long after that, scientists and philosophers alike have puzzled over what they call
the mind-body problem. Is the mind some separate, non-material
entity piloting a machine of flesh? Or if it's just a particularly elusive part
of our physical body, how can it translate the input of our
animal senses into the seemingly non-physical
experiences that we call thoughts? But though the answers have been
debated endlessly, new research suggests that
part of the problem lies in how we pose the question 
in the first place, assuming a distinction between our
sensory perception and our ideas that may not really be there. The traditional model of our mental
function has been that the senses provide
separate data to our brain which are then translated into the 
appropriate mental phenomena: visual images into trees, auditory
experiences into bird songs, and so on. But occasionally, 
we have come across people whose senses seem to mingle together,
allowing them to hear colors, or taste sounds. Until recently, the common understanding
was that this phenomenon, called synesthesia, was a direct connection between the
parts of the brain responsible for sensory stimuli such as seeing the color yellow immediately
upon hearing the tone of b flat. But newer studies have 
shown that synesthesia is actually mediated through our 
understanding of the shapes, colors and sounds
that our senses apprehend. In order for the cross-sensory
experiences to occur, the higher level ideas and concepts
that our minds associate with the sensory input must be activated. For example, this shape can be seen as
either the letter "s" or the number "5," and synesthetes associate each with 
different colors or sounds based on how they interpret it despite the purely visual stimulus 
remaining identical. In another study, synesthetes created
novel color associations for unfamiliar letters after learning
what the letters were. So because it relies on a connection
between ideas and senses, this mental phenomenon 
underlying synesthesia is known as ideasthesia. Synesthesia only occurs in some people, although it may be more common
than previously thought. But ideasthesia itself is a 
fundamental part of our lives. Virtually all of us recognize the color
red as warm and blue as cold. Many would agree that bright colors,
italic letters and thin lines are high-pitched, while earth tones are low-pitched. And while many of these associations
are acquired through cultural exposure, others have been demonstrated even
in infants and apes, suggesting that at least 
some associations are inborn. When asked to choose between two
possible names for these shapes, people from entirely different cultural
and language backgrounds overwhelmingly agree that "kiki"
is the spiky star, while "bouba" is the rounded blob, both because of the sounds themselves
and the shapes our mouths make to produce them. And this leads to even more
associations within a rich semantic network. Kiki is described as nervous and clever, while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow. What all of this suggests is that our
everyday experiences of colors, sounds and other stimuli
do not live on separate sensory islands but are organized in a 
network of associations similar to our language network. This is what enables us to 
understand metaphors even though they make no logical sense, such as the comparison of snow
to a white blanket, based on the shared sensations of
softness and lightness. Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art, which relies on a synthesis of
the conceptual and the emotional. In great art, idea and aesthesia
enhance each other, whether it's song lyrics combining
perfectly with a melody, the thematic content of a painting heightened by its use of
colors and brushstrokes, or the well constructed plot of a novel conveyed through perfectly 
crafted sentences. Most importantly, the network of
associations formed by ideasethesia may not only be similar to 
our linguistic network but may, in fact, be an integral part of it. Rather than the traditional view, where our senses first capture 
a collection of colors and shapes, or some vibrations in the air, and our mind then classifies them as a
tree or a siren, ideasthesia suggests that the two
processes occur simultaneously. Our sensory perceptions are shaped by
our conceptual understanding of the world. and the two are so connected that one
cannot exist without the other. If this model suggested 
by ideasthesia is accurate, it may have major implications
for some of the biggest scientific and philosophical issues
surrounding the study of mind. Without a preexisting concept of self, Descartes would not have had an "I"
to attribute the thinking to. And without a preexisting network of
interrelated and distinct concepts, our sensory experience of the world
would be an undifferentiated mass rather than the discrete objects
we actually apprehend. For science, the task is to find where
this network lies, how it is formed, and
how it interacts with external stimuli. For philosophy, 
the challenge is to rethink what this new model of consciousness means
for our understanding of our selves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
Long before Descartes famously declared,
"I think, therefore I am," and long after that, scientists and philosophers alike have puzzled over what they call
the mind-body problem. Is the mind some separate, non-material
entity piloting a machine of flesh? Or if it's just a particularly elusive part
of our physical body, how can it translate the input of our
animal senses into the seemingly non-physical
experiences that we call thoughts? But though the answers have been
debated endlessly, new research suggests that
part of the problem lies in how we pose the question 
in the first place, assuming a distinction between our
sensory perception and our ideas that may not really be there. The traditional model of our mental
function has been that the senses provide
separate data to our brain which are then translated into the 
appropriate mental phenomena: visual images into trees, auditory
experiences into bird songs, and so on. But occasionally, 
we have come across people whose senses seem to mingle together,
allowing them to hear colors, or taste sounds. Until recently, the common understanding
was that this phenomenon, called synesthesia, was a direct connection between the
parts of the brain responsible for sensory stimuli such as seeing the color yellow immediately
upon hearing the tone of b flat. But newer studies have 
shown that synesthesia is actually mediated through our 
understanding of the shapes, colors and sounds
that our senses apprehend. In order for the cross-sensory
experiences to occur, the higher level ideas and concepts
that our minds associate with the sensory input must be activated. For example, this shape can be seen as
either the letter "s" or the number "5," and synesthetes associate each with 
different colors or sounds based on how they interpret it despite the purely visual stimulus 
remaining identical. In another study, synesthetes created
novel color associations for unfamiliar letters after learning
what the letters were. So because it relies on a connection
between ideas and senses, this mental phenomenon 
underlying synesthesia is known as ideasthesia. Synesthesia only occurs in some people, although it may be more common
than previously thought. But ideasthesia itself is a 
fundamental part of our lives. Virtually all of us recognize the color
red as warm and blue as cold. Many would agree that bright colors,
italic letters and thin lines are high-pitched, while earth tones are low-pitched. And while many of these associations
are acquired through cultural exposure, others have been demonstrated even
in infants and apes, suggesting that at least 
some associations are inborn. When asked to choose between two
possible names for these shapes, people from entirely different cultural
and language backgrounds overwhelmingly agree that "kiki"
is the spiky star, while "bouba" is the rounded blob, both because of the sounds themselves
and the shapes our mouths make to produce them. And this leads to even more
associations within a rich semantic network. Kiki is described as nervous and clever, while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow. What all of this suggests is that our
everyday experiences of colors, sounds and other stimuli
do not live on separate sensory islands but are organized in a 
network of associations similar to our language network. This is what enables us to 
understand metaphors even though they make no logical sense, such as the comparison of snow
to a white blanket, based on the shared sensations of
softness and lightness. Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art, which relies on a synthesis of
the conceptual and the emotional. In great art, idea and aesthesia
enhance each other, whether it's song lyrics combining
perfectly with a melody, the thematic content of a painting heightened by its use of
colors and brushstrokes, or the well constructed plot of a novel conveyed through perfectly 
crafted sentences. Most importantly, the network of
associations formed by ideasethesia may not only be similar to 
our linguistic network but may, in fact, be an integral part of it. Rather than the traditional view, where our senses first capture 
a collection of colors and shapes, or some vibrations in the air, and our mind then classifies them as a
tree or a siren, ideasthesia suggests that the two
processes occur simultaneously. Our sensory perceptions are shaped by
our conceptual understanding of the world. and the two are so connected that one
cannot exist without the other. If this model suggested 
by ideasthesia is accurate, it may have major implications
for some of the biggest scientific and philosophical issues
surrounding the study of mind. Without a preexisting concept of self, Descartes would not have had an "I"
to attribute the thinking to. And without a preexisting network of
interrelated and distinct concepts, our sensory experience of the world
would be an undifferentiated mass rather than the discrete objects
we actually apprehend. For science, the task is to find where
this network lies, how it is formed, and
how it interacts with external stimuli. For philosophy, 
the challenge is to rethink what this new model of consciousness means
for our understanding of our selves and our relation to the world around us.

underlying synesthesia is known as ideasthesia. Synesthesia only occurs in some people, although it may be more common
than previously thought. But ideasthesia itself is a 
fundamental part of our lives. Virtually all of us recognize the color
red as warm and blue as cold. Many would agree that bright colors,
italic letters and thin lines are high-pitched, while earth tones are low-pitched. And while many of these associations
are acquired through cultural exposure, others have been demonstrated even
in infants and apes, suggesting that at least 
some associations are inborn. When asked to choose between two
possible names for these shapes, people from entirely different cultural
and language backgrounds overwhelmingly agree that "kiki"
is the spiky star, while "bouba" is the rounded blob, both because of the sounds themselves
and the shapes our mouths make to produce them. And this leads to even more
associations within a rich semantic network. Kiki is described as nervous and clever, while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow. What all of this suggests is that our
everyday experiences of colors, sounds and other stimuli
do not live on separate sensory islands but are organized in a 
network of associations similar to our language network. This is what enables us to 
understand metaphors even though they make no logical sense, such as the comparison of snow
to a white blanket, based on the shared sensations of
softness and lightness. Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art, which relies on a synthesis of
the conceptual and the emotional. In great art, idea and aesthesia
enhance each other, whether it's song lyrics combining
perfectly with a melody, the thematic content of a painting heightened by its use of
colors and brushstrokes, or the well constructed plot of a novel conveyed through perfectly 
crafted sentences. Most importantly, the network of
associations formed by ideasethesia may not only be similar to 
our linguistic network but may, in fact, be an integral part of it. Rather than the traditional view, where our senses first capture 
a collection of colors and shapes, or some vibrations in the air, and our mind then classifies them as a
tree or a siren, ideasthesia suggests that the two
processes occur simultaneously. Our sensory perceptions are shaped by
our conceptual understanding of the world. and the two are so connected that one
cannot exist without the other. If this model suggested 
by ideasthesia is accurate, it may have major implications
for some of the biggest scientific and philosophical issues
surrounding the study of mind. Without a preexisting concept of self, Descartes would not have had an "I"
to attribute the thinking to. And without a preexisting network of
interrelated and distinct concepts, our sensory experience of the world
would be an undifferentiated mass rather than the discrete objects
we actually apprehend. For science, the task is to find where
this network lies, how it is formed, and
how it interacts with external stimuli. For philosophy, 
the challenge is to rethink what this new model of consciousness means
for our understanding of our selves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
Humans have observed comets 
for thousands of years as their orbits have brought them within
visible distance of Earth. Appearing throughout historical records, these mysterious lights that 
came out of nowhere and disappeared after a short while were thought to be ill omens of
war and famine, or the wrath of gods. But recent research has revealed that
comets may be even more deeply connected to humanity and our presence on Earth than any of these mythical 
explanations suggested. When you think of our Solar System,
you probably imagine the nine, sorry eight, planets orbiting the Sun. But beyond Neptune,
far from the heat of the Sun, there is a sparse ring found 
formed by icy chunks ranging from the size 
of marbles to that of small planets. And thousands of times farther at the
outer reaches of the Solar System lies a spherical cloud of small 
fragments and gases. Many of these ancient clumps of stardust
are leftovers from the formation of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, while some of the most distant may even
come from a neighboring system. But sometimes the gravity from 
passing planets or stars pulls them toward our sun, beginning a journey that can take up to
millions of years. As the frozen object travels further
into the Solar System, the sun grows from a distant spark
to an inferno, melting the ice for the first time
in billions of years. Gas and steam eject dust into space, forming a bright surrounding cloud,
called a coma, that can grow even larger than
the sun itself. Meanwhile, the intense stream of 
high-energy particles constantly emitted by the Sun,
known as the solar wind, blows particles away from 
the comet's core, forming a trail of debris up to millions
of miles long. The ice, gas and dust reflect 
light glowing brightly. A comet is born, now orbiting the sun
along with the rest of the objects in our Solar System. But as the comet travels through
the Solar System, the solar wind tears apart and recombines
molecules into various compounds. In some of the compounds that
scientists found, first in the rubble left by a meteorite
that disintegrated above northern Canada, and then in samples collected by a space
craft from a passing comet's tail, were nothing less important than
amino acids. Coming together to form proteins
according to the instructs encoded in DNA, these are the main active components
in all living cells, from bacteria to blue whales. If comets are where these building blocks
of life were first formed, then they are the ultimate source of
life on Earth, and, perhaps, some of the other places
they visited as well. We know that planets orbit nearly every
star in the night sky, with one in five having a planet
similar to Earth in size and temperature. If Earth-like planets and the molecules
found in DNA are not anomalies, we may be only one 
example of what's possible when a planet under the right conditions
is seeded with organic molecules by a passing comet. So, rather than an omen of death, the comet that first brought 
amino acids to Earth could have been a portent of life, a prediction of a distant future,
where creatures of stardust would return to space to find 
the mysteries of where they came from.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 7 does not specifically ask about the cloud of dust and gas surrounding a comet's rocky core, I will continue to look for a better match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that Question 3 mentions the composition of a comet's tail, which includes gas and dust. However, it does not specifically ask about the cloud surrounding the comet's core.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, with the understanding that it's not an exact match.

fragments and gases. Many of these ancient clumps of stardust
are leftovers from the formation of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, while some of the most distant may even
come from a neighboring system. But sometimes the gravity from 
passing planets or stars pulls them toward our sun, beginning a journey that can take up to
millions of years. As the frozen object travels further
into the Solar System, the sun grows from a distant spark
to an inferno, melting the ice for the first time
in billions of years. Gas and steam eject dust into space, forming a bright surrounding cloud,
called a coma, that can grow even larger than
the sun itself. Meanwhile, the intense stream of 
high-energy particles constantly emitted by the Sun,
known as the solar wind, blows particles away from 
the comet's core, forming a trail of debris up to millions
of miles long. The ice, gas and dust reflect 
light glowing brightly. A comet is born, now orbiting the sun
along with the rest of the objects in our Solar System. But as the comet travels through
the Solar System, the solar wind tears apart and recombines
molecules into various compounds. In some of the compounds that
scientists found, first in the rubble left by a meteorite
that disintegrated above northern Canada, and then in samples collected by a space
craft from a passing comet's tail, were nothing less important than
amino acids. Coming together to form proteins
according to the instructs encoded in DNA, these are the main active components
in all living cells, from bacteria to blue whales. If comets are where these building blocks
of life were first formed, then they are the ultimate source of
life on Earth, and, perhaps, some of the other places
they visited as well. We know that planets orbit nearly every
star in the night sky, with one in five having a planet
similar to Earth in size and temperature. If Earth-like planets and the molecules
found in DNA are not anomalies, we may be only one 
example of what's possible when a planet under the right conditions
is seeded with organic molecules by a passing comet. So, rather than an omen of death, the comet that first brought 
amino acids to Earth could have been a portent of life, a prediction of a distant future,
where creatures of stardust would return to space to find 
the mysteries of where they came from.

Humans have observed comets 
for thousands of years as their orbits have brought them within
visible distance of Earth. Appearing throughout historical records, these mysterious lights that 
came out of nowhere and disappeared after a short while were thought to be ill omens of
war and famine, or the wrath of gods. But recent research has revealed that
comets may be even more deeply connected to humanity and our presence on Earth than any of these mythical 
explanations suggested. When you think of our Solar System,
you probably imagine the nine, sorry eight, planets orbiting the Sun. But beyond Neptune,
far from the heat of the Sun, there is a sparse ring found 
formed by icy chunks ranging from the size 
of marbles to that of small planets. And thousands of times farther at the
outer reaches of the Solar System lies a spherical cloud of small 
fragments and gases. Many of these ancient clumps of stardust

For most of us, two degrees Celsius
is a tiny difference in temperature, not even enough to make 
you crack a window. But scientists have warned that as
CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise, an increase in the Earth's temperature
by even this amount can lead to catastrophic effects
all over the world. How can such a small measurable 
change in one factor lead to massive and unpredictable 
changes in other factors? The answer lies in the concept of a 
mathematical tipping point, which we can understand through the
familiar game of billiards. The basic rule of billiard motion is that a ball will go straight 
until it hits a wall, then bounce off at an angle equal
to its incoming angle. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that
there is no friction, so balls can keep moving indefinitely. And to simplify the situation further, let's look at what happens with only 
one ball on a perfectly circular table. As the ball is struck and begins to move
according to the rules, it follows a neat star-shaped pattern. If we start the ball at
different locations, or strike it at different angles, 
some details of the pattern change, but its overall form remains the same. With a few test runs, and some basic
mathematical modeling, we can even predict a ball's path
before it starts moving, simply based on its starting conditions. But what would happen 
if we made a minor change in the table's shape 
by pulling it apart a bit, and inserting two small straight edges 
along the top and bottom? We can see that as the ball bounces 
off the flat sides, it begins to move all over the table. The ball is still obeying the same rules
of billiard motion, but the resulting movement no longer
follows any recognizable pattern. With only a small change
to the constraints under which the system operates, we have shifted the billiard motion from behaving in a stable
and predictable fashion, to fluctuating wildly, thus creating what mathematicians
call chaotic motion. Inserting the straight edges into
the table acts as a tipping point, switching the systems behavior
from one type of behavior (regular), to another type of behavior (chaotic). So what implications does this simple
example have for the much more complicated reality of the Earth's climate? We can think of the shape of the table as 
being analogous to the CO2 level and Earth's average temperature: Constraints that impact the 
system's performance in the form of the ball's motion 
or the climate's behavior. During the past 10,000 years, the fairly constant CO2 atmospheric 
concentration of 270 parts per million kept the climate
within a self-stabilizing pattern, fairly regular and hospitable 
to human life. But with CO2 levels now at 400
parts per million, and predicted to rise to between
500 and 800 parts per million over the coming century,
we may reach a tipping point where even a small additional change 
in the global average temperature would have the same effect as
changing the shape of the table, leading to a dangerous shift in the
climate's behavior, with more extreme and intense 
weather events, less predictability, and most importantly,
less hospitably to human life. The hypothetical models that 
mathematicians study in detail may not always look like 
actual situations, but they can provide a framework
and a way of thinking that can be applied to help understand the
more complex problems of the real world. In this case, understanding 
how slight changes in the constraints impacting a system
can have massive impacts gives us a greater appreciation for
predicting the dangers that we cannot immediately percieve 
with our own senses. Because once the results do become visible,
it may already be too late.

For most of us, two degrees Celsius
is a tiny difference in temperature, not even enough to make 
you crack a window. But scientists have warned that as
CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise, an increase in the Earth's temperature
by even this amount can lead to catastrophic effects
all over the world. How can such a small measurable 
change in one factor lead to massive and unpredictable 
changes in other factors? The answer lies in the concept of a 
mathematical tipping point, which we can understand through the
familiar game of billiards. The basic rule of billiard motion is that a ball will go straight 
until it hits a wall, then bounce off at an angle equal
to its incoming angle. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that
there is no friction, so balls can keep moving indefinitely. And to simplify the situation further, let's look at what happens with only 
one ball on a perfectly circular table. As the ball is struck and begins to move
according to the rules, it follows a neat star-shaped pattern. If we start the ball at
different locations, or strike it at different angles, 
some details of the pattern change, but its overall form remains the same. With a few test runs, and some basic
mathematical modeling, we can even predict a ball's path
before it starts moving, simply based on its starting conditions. But what would happen 
if we made a minor change in the table's shape 
by pulling it apart a bit, and inserting two small straight edges 
along the top and bottom? We can see that as the ball bounces 
off the flat sides, it begins to move all over the table. The ball is still obeying the same rules
of billiard motion, but the resulting movement no longer
follows any recognizable pattern. With only a small change
to the constraints under which the system operates, we have shifted the billiard motion from behaving in a stable
and predictable fashion, to fluctuating wildly, thus creating what mathematicians
call chaotic motion. Inserting the straight edges into
the table acts as a tipping point, switching the systems behavior
from one type of behavior (regular), to another type of behavior (chaotic). So what implications does this simple
example have for the much more complicated reality of the Earth's climate? We can think of the shape of the table as 
being analogous to the CO2 level and Earth's average temperature: Constraints that impact the 
system's performance in the form of the ball's motion 
or the climate's behavior. During the past 10,000 years, the fairly constant CO2 atmospheric 
concentration of 270 parts per million kept the climate
within a self-stabilizing pattern, fairly regular and hospitable 
to human life. But with CO2 levels now at 400
parts per million, and predicted to rise to between
500 and 800 parts per million over the coming century,
we may reach a tipping point where even a small additional change 
in the global average temperature would have the same effect as
changing the shape of the table, leading to a dangerous shift in the
climate's behavior, with more extreme and intense 
weather events, less predictability, and most importantly,
less hospitably to human life. The hypothetical models that 
mathematicians study in detail may not always look like 
actual situations, but they can provide a framework
and a way of thinking that can be applied to help understand the
more complex problems of the real world. In this case, understanding 
how slight changes in the constraints impacting a system
can have massive impacts gives us a greater appreciation for
predicting the dangers that we cannot immediately percieve 
with our own senses. Because once the results do become visible,
it may already be too late.

**Transcript**:
The sun is shining. The birds are singing. It looks like the start
of another lovely day. You're walking happily
in the park, when, "Ah-choo!" A passing stranger has expelled mucus
and saliva from their mouth and nose. You can feel the droplets
of moisture land on your skin, but what you can't feel are
the thousands, or even millions, of microscopic germs that have covertly
traveled through the air and onto your clothing, hands and face. As gross as this scenario sounds, it's actually very common for our bodies
to be exposed to disease-causing germs, and most of the time,
it's not nearly as obvious. Germs are found on almost every surface
we come into contact with. When we talk about germs, we're actually referring to many different
kinds of microscopic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. But what our germs all have in common
is the ability to interact with our bodies and change how we feel and function. Scientists who study infectious diseases
have wondered for decades why it is that some of these germs
are relatively harmless, while others cause devastating effects
and can sometimes be fatal. We still haven't solved the entire puzzle, but what we do know
is that the harmfulness, or virulence, of a germ is a result of evolution. How can it be that the same
evolutionary process can produce germs that cause
very different levels of harm? The answer starts to become clear if we think about a germ's
mode of transmission, which is the strategy it uses
to get from one host to the next. A common mode of transmission
occurs through the air, like the sneeze you just witnessed, and one germ that uses
this method is the rhinovirus, which replicates in our upper airways, and is responsible
for up to half of all common colds. Now, imagine that after the sneeze, one of three hypothetical
varieties of rhinovirus, let's call them "too much,"
"too little," and "just right," has been lucky enough to land on you. These viruses are hardwired to replicate, but because of genetic differences,
they will do so at different rates. "Too much" multiplies very often, making it very successful
in the short run. However, this success comes
at a cost to you, the host. A quickly replicating virus
can cause more damage to your body, making cold symptoms more severe. If you're too sick to leave your home, you don't give the virus any opportunities
to jump to a new host. And if the disease should kill you, the virus' own life cycle will end
along with yours. "Too little," on the other hand,
multiplies rarely and causes you little harm in the process. Although this leaves you healthy enough
to interact with other potential hosts, the lack of symptoms means
you may not sneeze at all, or if you do, there may be too few viruses
in your mucus to infect anyone else. Meanwhile, "just right" has been
replicating quickly enough to ensure that you're carrying
sufficient amounts of the virus to spread but not so often that you're too sick
to get out of bed. And in the end, it's the one
that will be most successful at transmitting itself to new hosts
and giving rise to the next generation. This describes what scientists call
trade-off hypothesis. First developed in the early 1980s, it predicts that germs will evolve
to maximize their overall success by achieving a balance between
replicating within a host, which causes virulence,
and transmission to a new host. In the case of the rhinovirus, the hypothesis predicts that its evolution
will favor less virulent forms because it relies on close contact
to get to its next victim. For the rhinovirus,
a mobile host is a good host, and indeed, that is what we see. While most people experience
a runny nose, coughing and sneezing, the common cold is generally mild
and only lasts about a week. It would be great
if the story ended there, but germs use many other modes
of transmission. For example, the malaria parasite,
plasmodium, is transmitted by mosquitoes. Unlike the rhinovirus, it doesn't need us
to be up and about, and may even benefit from harming us since a sick and immobile person
is easier for mosquitoes to bite. We would expect germs
that depend less on host mobility, like those transmitted
by insects, water or food, to cause more severe symptoms. So, what can we do to reduce
the harmfulness of infectious diseases? Evolutionary biologist Dr. Paul Ewald has suggested that we can
actually direct their evolution through simple disease-control methods. By mosquito-proofing houses,
establishing clean water systems, or staying home when we get a cold, we can obstruct the transmission
strategies of harmful germs while creating a greater dependence
on host mobility. So, while traditional methods
of trying to eradicate germs may only breed stronger ones
in the long run, this innovative approach of encouraging
them to evolve milder forms could be a win-win situation. (Cough) Well, for the most part.

**Transcript**:
The sun is shining. The birds are singing. It looks like the start
of another lovely day. You're walking happily
in the park, when, "Ah-choo!" A passing stranger has expelled mucus
and saliva from their mouth and nose. You can feel the droplets
of moisture land on your skin, but what you can't feel are
the thousands, or even millions, of microscopic germs that have covertly
traveled through the air and onto your clothing, hands and face. As gross as this scenario sounds, it's actually very common for our bodies
to be exposed to disease-causing germs, and most of the time,
it's not nearly as obvious. Germs are found on almost every surface
we come into contact with. When we talk about germs, we're actually referring to many different
kinds of microscopic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. But what our germs all have in common
is the ability to interact with our bodies and change how we feel and function. Scientists who study infectious diseases
have wondered for decades why it is that some of these germs
are relatively harmless, while others cause devastating effects
and can sometimes be fatal. We still haven't solved the entire puzzle, but what we do know
is that the harmfulness, or virulence, of a germ is a result of evolution. How can it be that the same
evolutionary process can produce germs that cause
very different levels of harm? The answer starts to become clear if we think about a germ's
mode of transmission, which is the strategy it uses
to get from one host to the next. A common mode of transmission
occurs through the air, like the sneeze you just witnessed, and one germ that uses
this method is the rhinovirus, which replicates in our upper airways, and is responsible
for up to half of all common colds. Now, imagine that after the sneeze, one of three hypothetical
varieties of rhinovirus, let's call them "too much,"
"too little," and "just right," has been lucky enough to land on you. These viruses are hardwired to replicate, but because of genetic differences,
they will do so at different rates. "Too much" multiplies very often, making it very successful
in the short run. However, this success comes
at a cost to you, the host. A quickly replicating virus
can cause more damage to your body, making cold symptoms more severe. If you're too sick to leave your home, you don't give the virus any opportunities
to jump to a new host. And if the disease should kill you, the virus' own life cycle will end
along with yours. "Too little," on the other hand,
multiplies rarely and causes you little harm in the process. Although this leaves you healthy enough
to interact with other potential hosts, the lack of symptoms means
you may not sneeze at all, or if you do, there may be too few viruses
in your mucus to infect anyone else. Meanwhile, "just right" has been
replicating quickly enough to ensure that you're carrying
sufficient amounts of the virus to spread but not so often that you're too sick
to get out of bed. And in the end, it's the one
that will be most successful at transmitting itself to new hosts
and giving rise to the next generation. This describes what scientists call
trade-off hypothesis. First developed in the early 1980s, it predicts that germs will evolve
to maximize their overall success by achieving a balance between
replicating within a host, which causes virulence,
and transmission to a new host. In the case of the rhinovirus, the hypothesis predicts that its evolution
will favor less virulent forms because it relies on close contact
to get to its next victim. For the rhinovirus,
a mobile host is a good host, and indeed, that is what we see. While most people experience
a runny nose, coughing and sneezing, the common cold is generally mild
and only lasts about a week. It would be great
if the story ended there, but germs use many other modes
of transmission. For example, the malaria parasite,
plasmodium, is transmitted by mosquitoes. Unlike the rhinovirus, it doesn't need us
to be up and about, and may even benefit from harming us since a sick and immobile person
is easier for mosquitoes to bite. We would expect germs
that depend less on host mobility, like those transmitted
by insects, water or food, to cause more severe symptoms. So, what can we do to reduce
the harmfulness of infectious diseases? Evolutionary biologist Dr. Paul Ewald has suggested that we can
actually direct their evolution through simple disease-control methods. By mosquito-proofing houses,
establishing clean water systems, or staying home when we get a cold, we can obstruct the transmission
strategies of harmful germs while creating a greater dependence
on host mobility. So, while traditional methods
of trying to eradicate germs may only breed stronger ones
in the long run, this innovative approach of encouraging
them to evolve milder forms could be a win-win situation. (Cough) Well, for the most part.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of replication.

The ground truth MCQ asks for another word for "replication," and the correct answer is "multiplication." While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 4 mentions "replicating within a host" in the context of the trade-off hypothesis.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 4 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it at least mentions the concept of replication. However, please note that the question intent and content are not identical to the ground truth MCQ.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What is an example of a germ that uses a mode of transmission that does not rely on host mobility?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that combines the ideas presented in Question 6 and the relationship between host mobility and symptom severity.

A more similar question would be:

**Question: Germs that depend less on host mobility tend to have what characteristic?**

Unfortunately, this exact question is not present in the generated MCQs. However, based on the available options, I would recommend:

**Question 6** as the closest match, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly capture the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question: What is a characteristic of germs that depend less on host mobility for transmission?**
Options: A. They tend to have milder symptoms, B. They are usually transmitted by water, insects, or food, C. They include plasmodium and the rhinovirus, D. Both B and more severe symptoms.

**Transcript**:
Albert Einstein played a key role
in launching quantum mechanics through his theory of the
photoelectric effect but remained deeply bothered
by its philosophical implications. And though most of us still remember
him for deriving E=MC^2, his last great contribution to physics
was actually a 1935 paper, coauthored with his young colleagues
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. Regarded as an odd philosophical
footnote well into the 1980s, this EPR paper has recently become central
to a new understanding of quantum physics, with its description 
of a strange phenomenon now known as entangled states. The paper begins by considering a
source that spits out pairs of particles, each with two measurable properties. Each of these measurements has
two possible results of equal probability. Let's say zero or one
for the first property, and A or B for the second. Once a measurement is performed, subsequent measurements of the same
property in the same particle will yield the same result. The strange implication of this scenario is not only that the state 
of a single particle is indeterminate until it's measured, but that the measurement then
determines the state. What's more, the measurements 
affect each other. If you measure a particle 
as being in state 1, and follow it up with the second
type of measurement, you'll have a 50% chance of
getting either A or B, but if you then repeat 
the first measurement, you'll have a a 50% chance of getting zero even though the particle had already
been measured at one. So switching the property being measured
scrambles the original result, allowing for a new, random value. Things get even stranger
when you look at both particles. Each of the particles will produce
random results, but if you compare the two, you will find that they are
always perfectly correlated. For example, if both particles
are measured at zero, the relationship will always hold. The states of the two are entangled. Measuring one will tell you the other
with absolute certainty. But this entanglement seems to defy
Einstein's famous theory of relativity because there is nothing to limit the
distance between particles. If you measure one in New York at noon, and the other in San Francisco 
a nanosecond later, they still give exactly the same result. But if the measurement 
does determine the value, then this would require one particle
sending some sort of signal to the other at 13,000,000 times the speed of light, which according to relativity,
is impossible. For this reason, Einstein dismissed
entanglement as "spuckafte ferwirklung," or spooky action at a distance. He decided that quantum mechanics
must be incomplete, a mere approximation of a deeper reality
in which both particles have predetermined states that 
are hidden from us. Supporters of orthodox quantum theory
lead by Niels Bohr maintained that quantum states
really are fundamentally indeterminate, and entanglement allows 
the state of one particle to depend on that of its distant partner. For 30 years, physics remained 
at an impasse, until John Bell figured out that the key
to testing the EPR argument was to look at cases involving different
measurements on the two particles. The local hidden variable theories
favored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, strictly limited how often you could
get results like 1A or B0 because the outcomes would have to be
defined in advance. Bell showed that the purely 
quantum approach, where the state is truly 
indeterminate until measured, has different limits
and predicts mixed measurement results that are impossible in the
predetermined scenario. Once Bell had worked out how to test
the EPR argument, physicists went out and did it. Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s
and Alain Aspect in the early 80s, dozens of experiments have tested 
the EPR prediction, and all have found the same thing: quantum mechanics is correct. The correlations between the indeterminate
states of entangled particles are real and cannot be explained
by any deeper variable. The EPR paper turned out to be wrong
but brilliantly so. By leading physicists to think deeply
about the foundations of quantum physics, it led to further elaboration 
of the theory and helped launch research into subjects
like quantum information, now a thriving field with the potential to

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

However, the question content is not an exact match. Question 2 describes the phenomenon of entanglement, which is related to the concept of "spooky action at a distance" mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate match would be Question 5, which mentions Einstein's objection to entanglement due to its implication of faster-than-light communication, but it does not directly mention the 1935 paper.

None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 2, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Albert Einstein played a key role
in launching quantum mechanics through his theory of the
photoelectric effect but remained deeply bothered
by its philosophical implications. And though most of us still remember
him for deriving E=MC^2, his last great contribution to physics
was actually a 1935 paper, coauthored with his young colleagues
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. Regarded as an odd philosophical
footnote well into the 1980s, this EPR paper has recently become central
to a new understanding of quantum physics, with its description 
of a strange phenomenon now known as entangled states. The paper begins by considering a
source that spits out pairs of particles, each with two measurable properties. Each of these measurements has
two possible results of equal probability. Let's say zero or one
for the first property, and A or B for the second. Once a measurement is performed, subsequent measurements of the same
property in the same particle will yield the same result. The strange implication of this scenario is not only that the state 
of a single particle is indeterminate until it's measured, but that the measurement then
determines the state. What's more, the measurements 
affect each other. If you measure a particle 
as being in state 1, and follow it up with the second
type of measurement, you'll have a 50% chance of
getting either A or B, but if you then repeat 
the first measurement, you'll have a a 50% chance of getting zero even though the particle had already
been measured at one. So switching the property being measured
scrambles the original result, allowing for a new, random value. Things get even stranger
when you look at both particles. Each of the particles will produce
random results, but if you compare the two, you will find that they are
always perfectly correlated. For example, if both particles
are measured at zero, the relationship will always hold. The states of the two are entangled. Measuring one will tell you the other
with absolute certainty. But this entanglement seems to defy
Einstein's famous theory of relativity because there is nothing to limit the
distance between particles. If you measure one in New York at noon, and the other in San Francisco 
a nanosecond later, they still give exactly the same result. But if the measurement 
does determine the value, then this would require one particle
sending some sort of signal to the other at 13,000,000 times the speed of light, which according to relativity,
is impossible. For this reason, Einstein dismissed
entanglement as "spuckafte ferwirklung," or spooky action at a distance. He decided that quantum mechanics
must be incomplete, a mere approximation of a deeper reality
in which both particles have predetermined states that 
are hidden from us. Supporters of orthodox quantum theory
lead by Niels Bohr maintained that quantum states
really are fundamentally indeterminate, and entanglement allows 
the state of one particle to depend on that of its distant partner. For 30 years, physics remained 
at an impasse, until John Bell figured out that the key
to testing the EPR argument was to look at cases involving different
measurements on the two particles. The local hidden variable theories
favored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, strictly limited how often you could
get results like 1A or B0 because the outcomes would have to be
defined in advance. Bell showed that the purely 
quantum approach, where the state is truly 
indeterminate until measured, has different limits
and predicts mixed measurement results that are impossible in the
predetermined scenario. Once Bell had worked out how to test
the EPR argument, physicists went out and did it. Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s
and Alain Aspect in the early 80s, dozens of experiments have tested 
the EPR prediction, and all have found the same thing: quantum mechanics is correct. The correlations between the indeterminate
states of entangled particles are real and cannot be explained
by any deeper variable. The EPR paper turned out to be wrong
but brilliantly so. By leading physicists to think deeply
about the foundations of quantum physics, it led to further elaboration 
of the theory and helped launch research into subjects
like quantum information, now a thriving field with the potential to
develop computers of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the randomness
of the measured results prevents science fiction scenarios, like using entangled particles
to send messages faster than light. So relativity is safe, for now. But the quantum universe is far stranger
than Einstein wanted to believe.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 5 are similar to those of the ground truth MCQ. Both questions address the relationship between entanglement and Einstein's theory of relativity, and both correct options (D in Question 5 and A in the ground truth MCQ) mention the issue of faster-than-light communication or influence, which is the core of Einstein's objection to entanglement.

However, it's worth noting that Question 5 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ. A more precise match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly states the apparent conflict between entanglement and relativity, as in the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 5 is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

in which both particles have predetermined states that 
are hidden from us. Supporters of orthodox quantum theory
lead by Niels Bohr maintained that quantum states
really are fundamentally indeterminate, and entanglement allows 
the state of one particle to depend on that of its distant partner. For 30 years, physics remained 
at an impasse, until John Bell figured out that the key
to testing the EPR argument was to look at cases involving different
measurements on the two particles. The local hidden variable theories
favored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, strictly limited how often you could
get results like 1A or B0 because the outcomes would have to be
defined in advance. Bell showed that the purely 
quantum approach, where the state is truly 
indeterminate until measured, has different limits
and predicts mixed measurement results that are impossible in the
predetermined scenario. Once Bell had worked out how to test
the EPR argument, physicists went out and did it. Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s
and Alain Aspect in the early 80s, dozens of experiments have tested 
the EPR prediction, and all have found the same thing: quantum mechanics is correct. The correlations between the indeterminate
states of entangled particles are real and cannot be explained
by any deeper variable. The EPR paper turned out to be wrong
but brilliantly so. By leading physicists to think deeply
about the foundations of quantum physics, it led to further elaboration 
of the theory and helped launch research into subjects
like quantum information, now a thriving field with the potential to
develop computers of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the randomness
of the measured results prevents science fiction scenarios, like using entangled particles
to send messages faster than light. So relativity is safe, for now. But the quantum universe is far stranger
than Einstein wanted to believe.

**Transcript**:
Austrian physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger is
one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he's most famous for something he
never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat. He imagined taking a cat and
placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?" Common sense suggests that the cat
is either alive or dead, but Schr√∂dinger pointed out that according
to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is 
a blur of probability, half one thing and half the other. This seems absurd, 
which was Schr√∂dinger's point. He found quantum physics so 
philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make and turned to writing about biology. As absurd as it may seem, though,
Schr√∂dinger's cat is very real. In fact, it's essential. If it weren't possible for quantum objects
to be in two states at once, the computer you're using to watch this
couldn't exist. The quantum phenomenon of 
superposition is a consequence of the dual
particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have
a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions
at the same time. The wavelength of an object limited
to a small region of space can't be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths
at the same time. We don't see these wave properties
for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases
as the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy. If we took a single atom and blew
it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System. That's far too small to detect, so we'll
never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence
of its dual nature. If we shoot electrons one at a time at a
set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected
at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But if you repeat this 
experiment many times, keeping track of all the 
individual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons separated by regions
where there are none at all. Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology. An electron near the nucleus of an atom
exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit. Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to 
choose just one atom but are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form. An electron in a molecule isn't on
just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms,
the electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms
at the same time. The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them,
extending over a large range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move
through the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator
or a semiconductor. Understanding how electrons are shared
among atoms allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors
in the right way allows us to make transistors 
on a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using to
watch this video. An old joke says that the Internet 
exists to allow the sharing of cat videos. At a very deep level, though,
the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist
and his imaginary cat.

individual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons separated by regions
where there are none at all. Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology. An electron near the nucleus of an atom
exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit. Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to 
choose just one atom but are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form. An electron in a molecule isn't on
just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms,
the electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms
at the same time. The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them,
extending over a large range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move
through the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator
or a semiconductor. Understanding how electrons are shared
among atoms allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors
in the right way allows us to make transistors 
on a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using to
watch this video. An old joke says that the Internet 
exists to allow the sharing of cat videos. At a very deep level, though,
the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist
and his imaginary cat.

**Transcript**:
Austrian physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger is
one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he's most famous for something he
never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat. He imagined taking a cat and
placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?" Common sense suggests that the cat
is either alive or dead, but Schr√∂dinger pointed out that according
to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is 
a blur of probability, half one thing and half the other. This seems absurd, 
which was Schr√∂dinger's point. He found quantum physics so 
philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make and turned to writing about biology. As absurd as it may seem, though,
Schr√∂dinger's cat is very real. In fact, it's essential. If it weren't possible for quantum objects
to be in two states at once, the computer you're using to watch this
couldn't exist. The quantum phenomenon of 
superposition is a consequence of the dual
particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have
a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions
at the same time. The wavelength of an object limited
to a small region of space can't be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths
at the same time. We don't see these wave properties
for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases
as the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy. If we took a single atom and blew
it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System. That's far too small to detect, so we'll
never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence
of its dual nature. If we shoot electrons one at a time at a
set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected
at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But if you repeat this 
experiment many times, keeping track of all the 
individual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons separated by regions
where there are none at all. Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads

Many people in the United States
and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary
of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer
who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought
colonialism and slavery? And did he even discover America at all? It's time to put Columbus on the stand
in History vs. Christopher Columbus. "Order, order in the court. Wait, am I even supposed to 
be at work today?" Cough "Yes, your Honor. From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated
in many parts of the United States on October 12th,
the actual anniversary date. But although it was declared
an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required
to observe it. Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away
from it completely." Cough "What a pity. In the 70s, we even moved it to the
second Monday in October so people could get a nice 
three-day weekend, but I guess you folks
just hate celebrations." "Uh, what are we celebrating again?" "Come on, Your Honor, 
we all learned it in school. Christopher Columbus convinced the King
of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land
but sailing West around the globe. Everyone said it was crazy because they
still thought the world was flat, but he knew better. And when in 1492 he
sailed the ocean blue, he found something better
than India: a whole new continent." "What rubbish. First of all, educated people knew
the world was round since Aristotle. Secondly, Columbus didn't 
discover anything. There were already people living here
for millennia. And he wasn't even 
the first European to visit. The Norse had settled Newfoundland
almost 500 years before." "You don't say, so how come we're not
all wearing those cow helmets?" "Actually, they didn't really 
wear those either." Cough "Who cares what some Vikings did
way back when? Those settlements didn't last,
but Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe
spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers
who came after. Without him, none of us 
would be here today." "And because of him, millions of
Native Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did
in the colonies he founded? He took the very first 
natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily
he could conquer and enslave all of them." "Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each
other back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding
and taking captives?" "Yes, but tribal warfare 
was sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90%
of the population." "Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus
so important to you, anyway?" "Your Honor, Columbus's voyage 
was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe,
symbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents
and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better
lives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind
everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?" "And what about the struggles 
of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out 
and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from
poverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man
who caused so much suffering?" "That's history. You can't judge a guy
in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization 
across the world was a moral duty." "Actually, he was pretty bad,
even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured
and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into 
sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other 
colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed 
from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary, 
Bartolom√© de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508,
over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in 
future generations will believe this?'" "Well, I'm not sure I believe 
those numbers." "Say, aren't there other ways the holiday
is celebrated?" "In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under
different names, such as D√≠a de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration
of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also
renamed the holiday, as Native American Day
or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly." "So, why not just change the name
if it's such a problem?" "Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes
and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating
the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this
serious research? It's not like anyone is actually 
celebrating genocide." "Traditions change, and the way 
we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values." "Well, it looks like giving tired judges a
day off isn't one of those values, anyway." Traditions and holidays 
are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era
may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands
and our values evolve. And deciding what these 
traditions should mean today is a major part 
of putting history on trial.

**Transcript**:
Many people in the United States
and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary
of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer
who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought
colonialism and slavery? And did he even discover America at all? It's time to put Columbus on the stand
in History vs. Christopher Columbus. "Order, order in the court. Wait, am I even supposed to 
be at work today?" Cough "Yes, your Honor. From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated
in many parts of the United States on October 12th,
the actual anniversary date. But although it was declared
an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required
to observe it. Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away
from it completely." Cough "What a pity. In the 70s, we even moved it to the
second Monday in October so people could get a nice 
three-day weekend, but I guess you folks
just hate celebrations." "Uh, what are we celebrating again?" "Come on, Your Honor, 
we all learned it in school. Christopher Columbus convinced the King
of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land
but sailing West around the globe. Everyone said it was crazy because they
still thought the world was flat, but he knew better. And when in 1492 he
sailed the ocean blue, he found something better
than India: a whole new continent." "What rubbish. First of all, educated people knew
the world was round since Aristotle. Secondly, Columbus didn't 
discover anything. There were already people living here
for millennia. And he wasn't even 
the first European to visit. The Norse had settled Newfoundland
almost 500 years before." "You don't say, so how come we're not
all wearing those cow helmets?" "Actually, they didn't really 
wear those either." Cough "Who cares what some Vikings did
way back when? Those settlements didn't last,
but Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe
spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers
who came after. Without him, none of us 
would be here today." "And because of him, millions of
Native Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did
in the colonies he founded? He took the very first 
natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily
he could conquer and enslave all of them." "Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each
other back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding
and taking captives?" "Yes, but tribal warfare 
was sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90%
of the population." "Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus
so important to you, anyway?" "Your Honor, Columbus's voyage 
was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe,
symbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents
and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better
lives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind
everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?" "And what about the struggles 
of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out 
and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from
poverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man
who caused so much suffering?" "That's history. You can't judge a guy
in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization 
across the world was a moral duty." "Actually, he was pretty bad,
even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured
and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into 
sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other 
colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed 
from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary, 
Bartolom√© de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508,
over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in 
future generations will believe this?'" "Well, I'm not sure I believe 
those numbers." "Say, aren't there other ways the holiday
is celebrated?" "In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under
different names, such as D√≠a de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration
of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also
renamed the holiday, as Native American Day
or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly." "So, why not just change the name
if it's such a problem?" "Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes
and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating
the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this
serious research? It's not like anyone is actually 
celebrating genocide." "Traditions change, and the way 
we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values." "Well, it looks like giving tired judges a
day off isn't one of those values, anyway." Traditions and holidays 
are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era
may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands
and our values evolve. And deciding what these 
traditions should mean today is a major part 
of putting history on trial.

**Transcript**:
Light is the fastest thing we know. It's so fast that we measure
enormous distances by how long it takes
for light to travel them. In one year, light travels
about 6,000,000,000,000 miles, a distance we call one light year. To give you an idea of just
how far this is, the Moon, which took the Apollo astronauts
four days to reach, is only one light-second from Earth. Meanwhile, the nearest star beyond
our own Sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.24 light years away. Our Milky Way is on the order of
100,000 light years across. The nearest galaxy to our own, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light years away Space is mind-blowingly vast. But wait, how do we know how
far away stars and galaxies are? After all, when we look at the sky,
we have a flat, two-dimensional view. If you point you finger to one star,
you can't tell how far the star is, so how do astrophysicists figure that out? For objects that are very close by, we can use a concept called
trigonometric parallax. The idea is pretty simple. Let's do an experiment. Stick out your thumb and 
close your left eye. Now, open your left eye and
close your right eye. It will look like your thumb has moved, while more distant background objects
have remained in place. The same concept applies when
we look at the stars, but distant stars are much, much 
farther away than the length of your arm, and the Earth isn't very large, so even if you had different telescopes
across the equator, you'd not see much of a shift in position. Instead, we look at the change in the
star's apparent location over six months, the halfway point of the Earth's
yearlong orbit around the Sun. When we measure the relative positions
of the stars in summer, and then again in winter,
it's like looking with your other eye. Nearby stars seem to have moved
against the background of the more distant stars and galaxies. But this method only works for objects no
more than a few thousand light years away. Beyond our own galaxy,
the distances are so great that the parallax is too small to detect
with even our most sensitive instruments. So at this point we have to rely 
on a different method using indicators we call standard candles. Standard candles are objects whose
intrinsic brightness, or luminosity, we know really well. For example, if you know how bright
your light bulb is, and you ask your friend to hold
the light bulb and walk away from you, you know that the amount of light
you receive from your friend will decrease by the distance squared. So by comparing the amount 
of light you receive to the intrinsic brightness 
of the light bulb, you can then tell how far away
your friend is. In astronomy, our light bulb turns out to
be a special type of star called a cepheid variable. These stars are internally unstable, like a constantly inflating 
and deflating balloon. And because the expansion and contraction
causes their brightness to vary, we can calculate their luminosity
by measuring the period of this cycle, with more luminous stars 
changing more slowly. By comparing the light
we observe from these stars to the intrinsic brightness we've
calculated this way, we can tell how far away they are. Unfortunately, this is still not 
the end of the story. We can only observe individual stars
up to about 40,000,000 light years away, after which they become 
too blurry to resolve. But luckily we have another type
of standard candle: the famous type 1a supernova. Supernovae, giant stellar explosions
are one of the ways that stars die. These explosions are so bright, that they outshine the galaxies
where they occur. So even when we can't see 
individual stars in a galaxy, we can still see supernovae 
when they happen. And type 1a supernovae turn out
to be usable as standard candles because intrinsically bright ones
fade slower than fainter ones. Through our understanding 
of this relationship between brightness and decline rate, we can use these supernovae 
to probe distances up to several billions of light years away. But why is it important to see
such distant objects anyway? Well, remember how fast light travels. For example, the light emitted by the Sun
will take eight minutes to reach us, which means that the light we see now
is a picture of the Sun eight minutes ago. When you look at the Big Dipper, you're seeing what it looked like
80 years ago. And those smudgy galaxies? They're millions of light years away. It has taken millions of years for
that light to reach us. So the universe itself is in some sense
an inbuilt time machine. The further we can look back,
the younger the universe we are probing. Astrophysicists try to read the history
of the universe, and understand how
and where we come from. The universe is constantly sending us
information in the form of light. All that remains if for us to decode it.

Light is the fastest thing we know. It's so fast that we measure
enormous distances by how long it takes
for light to travel them. In one year, light travels
about 6,000,000,000,000 miles, a distance we call one light year. To give you an idea of just
how far this is, the Moon, which took the Apollo astronauts
four days to reach, is only one light-second from Earth. Meanwhile, the nearest star beyond
our own Sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.24 light years away. Our Milky Way is on the order of
100,000 light years across. The nearest galaxy to our own, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light years away Space is mind-blowingly vast. But wait, how do we know how
far away stars and galaxies are? After all, when we look at the sky,
we have a flat, two-dimensional view. If you point you finger to one star,
you can't tell how far the star is, so how do astrophysicists figure that out? For objects that are very close by, we can use a concept called
trigonometric parallax. The idea is pretty simple. Let's do an experiment. Stick out your thumb and

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What method do astrophysicists use to measure the distance of objects that are relatively close to Earth?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about methods not used to measure distances. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 5: What is a standard candle in astronomy, and how is it used to measure distances?** is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions a method used to measure distances, and the ground truth MCQ asks about a method not used to measure distances.

However, I must note that **Question 3** and **Question 5** are not exact matches, and a new question should be generated to exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose one from the existing questions, I would choose **Question 5** as the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low confidence level.

on a different method using indicators we call standard candles. Standard candles are objects whose
intrinsic brightness, or luminosity, we know really well. For example, if you know how bright
your light bulb is, and you ask your friend to hold
the light bulb and walk away from you, you know that the amount of light
you receive from your friend will decrease by the distance squared. So by comparing the amount 
of light you receive to the intrinsic brightness 
of the light bulb, you can then tell how far away
your friend is. In astronomy, our light bulb turns out to
be a special type of star called a cepheid variable. These stars are internally unstable, like a constantly inflating 
and deflating balloon. And because the expansion and contraction
causes their brightness to vary, we can calculate their luminosity
by measuring the period of this cycle, with more luminous stars 
changing more slowly. By comparing the light
we observe from these stars to the intrinsic brightness we've
calculated this way, we can tell how far away they are. Unfortunately, this is still not 
the end of the story. We can only observe individual stars
up to about 40,000,000 light years away, after which they become 
too blurry to resolve. But luckily we have another type
of standard candle: the famous type 1a supernova. Supernovae, giant stellar explosions
are one of the ways that stars die. These explosions are so bright, that they outshine the galaxies
where they occur. So even when we can't see 
individual stars in a galaxy, we can still see supernovae 
when they happen. And type 1a supernovae turn out
to be usable as standard candles because intrinsically bright ones
fade slower than fainter ones. Through our understanding 
of this relationship between brightness and decline rate, we can use these supernovae 
to probe distances up to several billions of light years away. But why is it important to see
such distant objects anyway? Well, remember how fast light travels. For example, the light emitted by the Sun
will take eight minutes to reach us, which means that the light we see now
is a picture of the Sun eight minutes ago. When you look at the Big Dipper, you're seeing what it looked like
80 years ago. And those smudgy galaxies? They're millions of light years away. It has taken millions of years for
that light to reach us. So the universe itself is in some sense
an inbuilt time machine. The further we can look back,
the younger the universe we are probing. Astrophysicists try to read the history
of the universe, and understand how
and where we come from. The universe is constantly sending us
information in the form of light. All that remains if for us to decode it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it does relate to the concept of standard candles and how they are used to measure distances. The correct option of Question 5 also mentions comparing observed brightness to intrinsic brightness, which is similar to the concept presented in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. The ground truth MCQ seems to be more focused on the inverse square law of light and how it relates to distance, which is not explicitly covered in any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an answer, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but I would also like to mention that the similarity is not very high.

**Transcript**:
A, C, E, D, B, K. No, this isn't some random,
out of order alphabet. These are vitamins,
and just like letters build words, they're the building blocks
that keep the body running. Vitamins are organic compounds we need
to ingest in small amounts to keep functioning. They're the body's builders, defenders
and maintenance workers, helping it to build muscle and bone,
make use of nutrients, capture and use energy
and heal wounds. If you need convincing about
vitamin value, just consider the plight of 
olden day sailors, who had no access to vitamin-rich
fresh produce. They got scurvy. But vitamin C,
abundant in fruits and vegetables, was the simple antidote to this disease. While bacteria, fungi and plants
produce their own vitamins, our bodies can't, so we have to get
them from other sources. So how does the body get
vitamins from out there into here? That's dependent on the form
these compounds take. Vitamins come in two types: lipid-soluble and 
water-soluble, and the difference between them 
determines how the body transports and stores vitamins, 
and gets rid of the excess. The water-solubles are vitamin C and B Complex vitamins that are made up of
eight different types that each do something unique. These are dissolved in the watery parts
of fruits, vegetables and grains, meaning their passage through the body
is relatively straightforward. Once inside the system,
these foods are digested and the vitamins within them are
taken up directly by the bloodstream. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have their
transport cut out for them and can move around freely 
within the body. For lipid-soluble vitamins,
dissolved in fat and found in foods like diary,
butter and oils, this trip into the blood is a little
more adventurous. These vitamins make it through
the stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance
called bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing it for
absorption through the intestinal wall. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make
use of the blood's watery nature, they need something else 
to move them around, and that comes from proteins that attach
to the vitamins and act like couriers, transporting fat-solubles into the blood
and around the body. So, this difference between water-
or fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood, but also how they're stored 
or rejected from the body. The system's ability to circulate
water-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream so easily means that most of them can be passed
out equally easily via the kidneys. Because of that, 
most water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished on a daily basis
through the food we eat. But fat-soluble vitamins have
staying power because they can be packed into the liver
and in fat cells. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing the vitamins there and rationing
them out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload
on this type of vitamin because the body is generally 
well stocked. Once we figured the logistics
of transport and storage, the vitamins are left to do the work
they came here to do in the first place. Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,
make up coenzymes, whose job it is to help enzymes 
release the energy from food. Other B vitamins then help the body
to use that energy. From vitamin C, you get the ability to
fight infection and make collagen, a kind of tissue that forms 
bones and teeth and heals wounds. Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,
key in the body's defense, helps shape bones and improves vision 
by keeping the cells of the eye in check. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus 
so we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body
that can damage cells. Finally, from Vitamin K, we score
the ability to clot blood, since it helps make the proteins
that do this job. Without this vitamin variety, humans face deficiencies that 
cause a range of problems, like fatigue, nerve damage, 
heart disorders, or diseases like rickets and scurvy. On the other hand, too much of any
vitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading
yourself with supplements is a great idea. In reality, it's all about getting the
balance right, and hitting that vitamin jackpot.

**Transcript**:
A, C, E, D, B, K. No, this isn't some random,
out of order alphabet. These are vitamins,
and just like letters build words, they're the building blocks
that keep the body running. Vitamins are organic compounds we need
to ingest in small amounts to keep functioning. They're the body's builders, defenders
and maintenance workers, helping it to build muscle and bone,
make use of nutrients, capture and use energy
and heal wounds. If you need convincing about
vitamin value, just consider the plight of 
olden day sailors, who had no access to vitamin-rich
fresh produce. They got scurvy. But vitamin C,
abundant in fruits and vegetables, was the simple antidote to this disease. While bacteria, fungi and plants
produce their own vitamins, our bodies can't, so we have to get
them from other sources. So how does the body get
vitamins from out there into here? That's dependent on the form
these compounds take. Vitamins come in two types: lipid-soluble and 
water-soluble, and the difference between them 
determines how the body transports and stores vitamins, 
and gets rid of the excess. The water-solubles are vitamin C and B Complex vitamins that are made up of
eight different types that each do something unique. These are dissolved in the watery parts
of fruits, vegetables and grains, meaning their passage through the body
is relatively straightforward. Once inside the system,
these foods are digested and the vitamins within them are
taken up directly by the bloodstream. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have their
transport cut out for them and can move around freely 
within the body. For lipid-soluble vitamins,
dissolved in fat and found in foods like diary,
butter and oils, this trip into the blood is a little
more adventurous. These vitamins make it through
the stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance
called bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing it for
absorption through the intestinal wall. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make
use of the blood's watery nature, they need something else 
to move them around, and that comes from proteins that attach
to the vitamins and act like couriers, transporting fat-solubles into the blood
and around the body. So, this difference between water-
or fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood, but also how they're stored 
or rejected from the body. The system's ability to circulate
water-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream so easily means that most of them can be passed
out equally easily via the kidneys. Because of that, 
most water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished on a daily basis
through the food we eat. But fat-soluble vitamins have
staying power because they can be packed into the liver
and in fat cells. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing the vitamins there and rationing
them out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload
on this type of vitamin because the body is generally 
well stocked. Once we figured the logistics
of transport and storage, the vitamins are left to do the work
they came here to do in the first place. Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,
make up coenzymes, whose job it is to help enzymes 
release the energy from food. Other B vitamins then help the body
to use that energy. From vitamin C, you get the ability to
fight infection and make collagen, a kind of tissue that forms 
bones and teeth and heals wounds. Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,
key in the body's defense, helps shape bones and improves vision 
by keeping the cells of the eye in check. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus 
so we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body
that can damage cells. Finally, from Vitamin K, we score
the ability to clot blood, since it helps make the proteins
that do this job. Without this vitamin variety, humans face deficiencies that 
cause a range of problems, like fatigue, nerve damage, 
heart disorders, or diseases like rickets and scurvy. On the other hand, too much of any
vitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading
yourself with supplements is a great idea. In reality, it's all about getting the
balance right, and hitting that vitamin jackpot.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. Question 3 asks about how water-soluble vitamins enter the bloodstream, while the ground truth MCQ asks about how lipid-soluble vitamins from milk and butter dissolve in the body. However, both questions are related to the process of how vitamins are absorbed and transported in the body.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about lipid-soluble vitamins, but such a question is not present among the provided options. Therefore, Question 3 is the closest match, but it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly addresses the topic of lipid-soluble vitamins.

However, if we were to modify Question 3 to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ, it could be rewritten as:

Question: How do lipid-soluble vitamins from foods like milk and butter enter the bloodstream?

Options: A. They are dissolved in the watery parts of fruits, vegetables, and grains and taken up directly by the bloodstream., B. They are broken down by acids from the intestines and absorbed into the blood, C. They are attached to proteins that act as couriers, D. They are stored in the liver and fat cells.

Correct Option: B

This revised question would more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the benefits that vitamins can provide to the body, and the options include a range of functions such as releasing energy from food, defending infection and immunity, making blood and bones, and ensuring proper cell function.

While none of the generated MCQs exactly match this question, I would suggest that **Question 1** partially matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ. Question 1 asks about the definition and importance of vitamins, and option B mentions that vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs to ingest in small amounts to function properly. This option implies that vitamins provide various benefits to the body, but it does not explicitly state the specific benefits mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest **Question 10**. Question 10 asks about the importance of maintaining a balance of vitamins in the body, and option A mentions that it is to prevent deficiencies and toxicity. This option implies that vitamins provide various benefits to the body, and the question indirectly addresses the benefits of vitamins.

Please note that neither Question 1 nor Question 10 perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ, but they are the closest matches among the generated MCQs.

**Index of the most similar generated MCQ:** 10 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has 
been vast disagreement over what exactly it is and what,
if anything, to do about it. In its simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction 
to a difficult situation. You feel sad when a friend moves away
or when a pet dies. When a friend says, "I'm sad," you often respond by asking,
"What happened?" But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors didn't
view sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid
inside the body. According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled
by four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced
a person's health and temperament. Melancholia comes from
melaina kole, the word for black bile,
the humor believed to cause sadness. By changing your diet
and through medical practices, you could bring your humors
into balance. Even though we now know
much more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain 
kinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain. Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life
but an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness. In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow." The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To understand the sadness of the trees
losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle
of life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem
pretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on
a more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying
and feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our
ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,
was an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer
to the suffering person, and this helped both the person
and the larger community to thrive. Perhaps sadness helped generate
the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether
the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering
we experience ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne -
Or has an Easier size." And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists,
like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't
universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way
we use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness 
becomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality, and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms. David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his project 
"paradise engineering." But is there something sad about
a world without sadness? Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part 
of such a paradise. In fact, the only things about sadness
that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most
people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal
with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express
what feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -"

**Transcript**:
Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has 
been vast disagreement over what exactly it is and what,
if anything, to do about it. In its simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction 
to a difficult situation. You feel sad when a friend moves away
or when a pet dies. When a friend says, "I'm sad," you often respond by asking,
"What happened?" But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors didn't
view sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid
inside the body. According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled
by four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced
a person's health and temperament. Melancholia comes from
melaina kole, the word for black bile,
the humor believed to cause sadness. By changing your diet
and through medical practices, you could bring your humors
into balance. Even though we now know
much more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain 
kinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain. Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life
but an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness. In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow." The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To understand the sadness of the trees
losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle
of life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem
pretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on
a more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying
and feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our
ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,
was an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer
to the suffering person, and this helped both the person
and the larger community to thrive. Perhaps sadness helped generate
the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether
the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering
we experience ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne -
Or has an Easier size." And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists,
like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't
universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way
we use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness 
becomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality, and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms. David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his project 
"paradise engineering." But is there something sad about
a world without sadness? Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part 
of such a paradise. In fact, the only things about sadness
that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most
people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal
with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express
what feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -"

"What happened?" But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors didn't
view sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid
inside the body. According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled
by four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced
a person's health and temperament. Melancholia comes from
melaina kole, the word for black bile,
the humor believed to cause sadness. By changing your diet
and through medical practices, you could bring your humors
into balance. Even though we now know
much more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain 
kinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain. Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life
but an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness. In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow." The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To understand the sadness of the trees
losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle
of life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem
pretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on
a more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying
and feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our
ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,
was an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer
to the suffering person, and this helped both the person
and the larger community to thrive. Perhaps sadness helped generate
the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether
the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering
we experience ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne -
Or has an Easier size." And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists,
like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't
universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way
we use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness 
becomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality, and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms. David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his project 
"paradise engineering." But is there something sad about
a world without sadness? Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part 
of such a paradise. In fact, the only things about sadness
that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most
people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal
with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express
what feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -"

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the closest match in terms of question intent and content is Question 3, but it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ's focus on the neurochemical nature of depression and its parallel with ancient Greek ideas about melancholy.

A more suitable match would be a combination of Question 2 and Question 3, but since we need to choose one, I would suggest Question 2's content is not as close as another question that was not provided but can be found in Question 3's "C. Modern views attribute sadness to brain chemistry, while ancient Greek views attributed it to dark fluids" which shares some similarities with the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ.

However, after re-reading the generated MCQs, I found that none directly address the similarity between contemporary ideas about the neurochemical nature of depression and ancient Greek ideas about melancholy.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
When the infamous fictional character, Carrie White, left her high school
prom hall ablaze, and brought terror upon her town, she relied on her powers of telekinesis, the ability to manipulate physical
objects using the power of the mind alone. But while Carrie is just a fictional film
based upon a fictional book, belief in telekinesis
isn't fictional at all. For centuries, humans have claimed
they really do have the power to control the motion of objects
using only their minds. Levitation, opening doors at will
and spoon bending are all intriguing examples. It happens in the Matrix when Neo
freezes bullets midair, and it's a skill that 
Yoda has honed to a T. But is telekinesis real, or just as fictional as 
Carrie, Yoda and Neo combined? To investigate, we need to evaluate
telekinetic claims through a scientific lens
using the scientific method. Telekinesis is part of the discipline
called parapsychology, in which researchers study 
psychic phenomena. Parapsychologists regard what they 
do as a science, but other scientists disagree. Let's start with a few basic observations. Observation #1: While there are loads of anecdotes out
there about telekinesis, there's no scientific proof 
that it exists; no studies conducted according to
the scientific method and repeated under lab conditions
can show that its real. In the 1930s, the so-called father
of parapsychology, Joseph Banks Rhine, tested in the lab whether people
could use telekinesis to make a dice roll the way 
they wanted it to. But afterwards, scientists couldn't
replicate his results, and since replication is key
to proving an idea, that was a problem. Aside from scientists, there are also countless
self-proclaimed telekinetics, but all have been exposed as tricksters, or can't perform under conditions
where they're not totally in control, suggesting that they manipulate the
situation to get the results they want. Today, there's even a huge stash of prize
money available from lots of organizations for anyone who can prove that psychic
abilities, like telekinesis, are real. But these riches remain unclaimed. Observation #2: When we investigate telekinesis, there's no consensus about
what exactly is being measured. Are powerful, Yoda-like brainwaves
at work perhaps? Since nobody agrees, it's difficult
to apply a research standard, something required in all 
other types of science to test the validity of ideas. Observation #3: The point of science is to
discover the unknown, and in the history of 
scientific investigation, it's definitely happened that new discoveries have 
gone against established science, and even overturned 
whole branches of science. Such discoveries must be 
proven extra carefully to withstand skepticism. In the case of telekinesis, the idea goes against established science, but lacks the powerful
evidence in favor of it. Our universe is controlled
and explained by the laws of physics, and one of these laws tells us
that brain waves can't control objects because they're neither strong
nor far-reaching enough to influence anything 
outside of our skulls. Physics also tells us that the only forces
that can influence objects from afar are magnetic and gravitational. Probably the closest thing to 
telekinesis that science can explain is the use of thoughts
to control a robotic arm. In the brains of stroke 
patients who can't move, researchers can implant tiny wires
into the region that controls movement, and then train the patient to 
concentrate on moving a robotic arm, which acts like an extension
of their minds, and it works. It's amazing, but it isn't telekinesis. The patients thoughts aren't just vague,
undetectable things. They're measurable brain signals, translated through wires into a robot. Science can measure, test
and explain the motion, and that's how we've shown that 
this kind of mind control is real. Science is a slow process of accumulating the evidence that either stands 
for or against an idea. When we stack up evidence, we can see which tower grows tallest, and in the case of telekinesis,
it's not the tower showing that it exists. Some say this mystical phenomenon
can't fit within the confines of science, and that's okay. But then telekinesis becomes purely
a matter of personal conviction. If something can't be 
assessed scientifically, then it can't be described
as scientific either. So the results of our investigation reveal that however much 
we may want to believe that the force really is within us, the case for telekinesis
remains weak. Sorry Neo, Carrie and Yoda. Your skills are mind-blowing,
but for now, they belong in the movies.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that specifically addresses the importance of experiments or the scientific method in proving a theory.

A more suitable generated MCQ could be: 
Question: In science, what is the best way to prove a theory?
Options: A. Ideas, B. Anecdotes, C. Experiments, D. Creativity

Unfortunately, this MCQ is not present in the list of generated MCQs. However, among the available options, Question 8 is the closest match.

But if we were to choose another question that would be the closest match to the original, I would say Question 3 is the closest match.

 Question 3 discusses the importance of replication in scientific research and the fact that the results of the study on telekinesis could not be replicated is a significant issue, the question implies the importance of the scientific method (including replication) in proving a theory.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 9, is an even better match. It specifically addresses the importance of replication in ensuring the consistency and reliability of results, which is closely related to the concept of using experiments to prove a theory.

So the final answer is Question 9.

**Transcript**:
When the infamous fictional character, Carrie White, left her high school
prom hall ablaze, and brought terror upon her town, she relied on her powers of telekinesis, the ability to manipulate physical
objects using the power of the mind alone. But while Carrie is just a fictional film
based upon a fictional book, belief in telekinesis
isn't fictional at all. For centuries, humans have claimed
they really do have the power to control the motion of objects
using only their minds. Levitation, opening doors at will
and spoon bending are all intriguing examples. It happens in the Matrix when Neo
freezes bullets midair, and it's a skill that 
Yoda has honed to a T. But is telekinesis real, or just as fictional as 
Carrie, Yoda and Neo combined? To investigate, we need to evaluate
telekinetic claims through a scientific lens
using the scientific method. Telekinesis is part of the discipline
called parapsychology, in which researchers study 
psychic phenomena. Parapsychologists regard what they 
do as a science, but other scientists disagree. Let's start with a few basic observations. Observation #1: While there are loads of anecdotes out
there about telekinesis, there's no scientific proof 
that it exists; no studies conducted according to
the scientific method and repeated under lab conditions
can show that its real. In the 1930s, the so-called father
of parapsychology, Joseph Banks Rhine, tested in the lab whether people
could use telekinesis to make a dice roll the way 
they wanted it to. But afterwards, scientists couldn't
replicate his results, and since replication is key
to proving an idea, that was a problem. Aside from scientists, there are also countless
self-proclaimed telekinetics, but all have been exposed as tricksters, or can't perform under conditions
where they're not totally in control, suggesting that they manipulate the
situation to get the results they want. Today, there's even a huge stash of prize
money available from lots of organizations for anyone who can prove that psychic
abilities, like telekinesis, are real. But these riches remain unclaimed. Observation #2: When we investigate telekinesis, there's no consensus about
what exactly is being measured. Are powerful, Yoda-like brainwaves
at work perhaps? Since nobody agrees, it's difficult
to apply a research standard, something required in all 
other types of science to test the validity of ideas. Observation #3: The point of science is to
discover the unknown, and in the history of 
scientific investigation, it's definitely happened that new discoveries have 
gone against established science, and even overturned 
whole branches of science. Such discoveries must be 
proven extra carefully to withstand skepticism. In the case of telekinesis, the idea goes against established science, but lacks the powerful
evidence in favor of it. Our universe is controlled
and explained by the laws of physics, and one of these laws tells us
that brain waves can't control objects because they're neither strong
nor far-reaching enough to influence anything 
outside of our skulls. Physics also tells us that the only forces
that can influence objects from afar are magnetic and gravitational. Probably the closest thing to 
telekinesis that science can explain is the use of thoughts
to control a robotic arm. In the brains of stroke 
patients who can't move, researchers can implant tiny wires
into the region that controls movement, and then train the patient to 
concentrate on moving a robotic arm, which acts like an extension
of their minds, and it works. It's amazing, but it isn't telekinesis. The patients thoughts aren't just vague,
undetectable things. They're measurable brain signals, translated through wires into a robot. Science can measure, test
and explain the motion, and that's how we've shown that 
this kind of mind control is real. Science is a slow process of accumulating the evidence that either stands 
for or against an idea. When we stack up evidence, we can see which tower grows tallest, and in the case of telekinesis,
it's not the tower showing that it exists. Some say this mystical phenomenon
can't fit within the confines of science, and that's okay. But then telekinesis becomes purely
a matter of personal conviction. If something can't be 
assessed scientifically, then it can't be described
as scientific either. So the results of our investigation reveal that however much 
we may want to believe that the force really is within us, the case for telekinesis
remains weak. Sorry Neo, Carrie and Yoda. Your skills are mind-blowing,
but for now, they belong in the movies.

"Hey, another atom.
I'm hydrogen, nice to meet you. How are you feeling about the jump?" "Hi there, I'm antihydrogen,
your antiatom, and to be honest, I'm feeling
kind of neutral. My positron and antiproton balance out,
just like your electron and proton, right?" "Hey, yeah! You look just like me,
but different somehow." "Whoa, be careful! If we get too close,
we'll disappear in a spark of energy. I'd like to stay in one piece." "Oh wow, sorry." "It's okay. I was just thinking, it's kind of weird for us to be chatting like this before our 
jump above CERN." "Why's that?" "Well, for starters, how do we know
we'll both fall?" "Of course we'll fall. It's gravity, you know, the force of attraction 
between masses. I even know how fast we should fall. Galileo showed in that tower experiment that all falling objects accelerate 
at the same rate, regardless of mass." "That's for bigger objects. It's a different story 
for small particles like us. Our mass is so tiny that the gravitational
force we experience is miniscule, and if the particles are charged, 
like my antiproton or your proton, then it becomes impossible to detect compared to the much greater
electromagnetic force acting on them." "But that's only for charged particles.
You and I are both neutral. Our charges balance out,
so the electromagnetic force is small and the gravitational force
should be detectable. I know mine's been measured." "Because you're everywhere, 
but I'm kind of hard to find." "Why is that, anyway? Shouldn't there have been an equal amount of matter and antimatter created
in the Big Bang?" "You'd think so, but then all of
those particles would have annihilated 
each other into energy, remember? And the Universe is obviously
full of matter. No one knows why there is more matter
than antimatter, which is why scientists
are so interested in studying me." "So where do they find you anyway?" "Actually, I was made in that 
lab down there. They needed an accelerator to make
my antiproton because it's so heavy, just as heavy as your proton. Getting my positron was easier. It's much lighter, like your electron,
and there are materials that naturally decay by emitting one. Then they just had to put the two together
and they got me. But it's only recently that they've been able to keep me around long enough
to study my properties." "And now they've sent you on this
jump with me. Hey, wait a minute." "That's right. We're reenacting
Galileo's experiment, but with matter and antimatter
instead of two objects made of matter." "So what's going to happen? Are you going to fall 
upwards or something?" "Only one way to find out!"

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a related question.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the antimatter counterpart of an electron. Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 discusses the creation of antihydrogen, which involves a positron (the antimatter counterpart of an electron). Although Question 4 does not directly ask about the antimatter counterpart of an electron, it is the closest in terms of content and intent.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it's not a direct match.

"Hey, another atom.
I'm hydrogen, nice to meet you. How are you feeling about the jump?" "Hi there, I'm antihydrogen,
your antiatom, and to be honest, I'm feeling
kind of neutral. My positron and antiproton balance out,
just like your electron and proton, right?" "Hey, yeah! You look just like me,
but different somehow." "Whoa, be careful! If we get too close,
we'll disappear in a spark of energy. I'd like to stay in one piece." "Oh wow, sorry." "It's okay. I was just thinking, it's kind of weird for us to be chatting like this before our 
jump above CERN." "Why's that?" "Well, for starters, how do we know
we'll both fall?" "Of course we'll fall. It's gravity, you know, the force of attraction 
between masses. I even know how fast we should fall. Galileo showed in that tower experiment that all falling objects accelerate 
at the same rate, regardless of mass." "That's for bigger objects. It's a different story 
for small particles like us. Our mass is so tiny that the gravitational
force we experience is miniscule, and if the particles are charged, 
like my antiproton or your proton, then it becomes impossible to detect compared to the much greater
electromagnetic force acting on them." "But that's only for charged particles.
You and I are both neutral. Our charges balance out,
so the electromagnetic force is small and the gravitational force
should be detectable. I know mine's been measured." "Because you're everywhere, 
but I'm kind of hard to find." "Why is that, anyway? Shouldn't there have been an equal amount of matter and antimatter created
in the Big Bang?" "You'd think so, but then all of
those particles would have annihilated 
each other into energy, remember? And the Universe is obviously
full of matter. No one knows why there is more matter
than antimatter, which is why scientists
are so interested in studying me." "So where do they find you anyway?" "Actually, I was made in that 
lab down there. They needed an accelerator to make
my antiproton because it's so heavy, just as heavy as your proton. Getting my positron was easier. It's much lighter, like your electron,
and there are materials that naturally decay by emitting one. Then they just had to put the two together
and they got me. But it's only recently that they've been able to keep me around long enough
to study my properties." "And now they've sent you on this
jump with me. Hey, wait a minute." "That's right. We're reenacting
Galileo's experiment, but with matter and antimatter
instead of two objects made of matter." "So what's going to happen? Are you going to fall 
upwards or something?" "Only one way to find out!"

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the mass of the constituents of antihydrogen compared to the constituents of hydrogen. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, which asks about the challenge of detecting the gravitational force acting on small particles like antihydrogen. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the properties of antihydrogen and its behavior in a gravitational field.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 5 is also related to the topic, as it discusses the effect of the electromagnetic force on charged particles, which is relevant to the comparison of the masses of the constituents of antihydrogen and hydrogen.

But the most similar question is actually Question 8, it does not directly ask about the mass, however it implies a comparison between matter and antimatter in terms of the effect of gravity on them, which is the core idea behind the ground truth MCQ.

Given the options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, however since it does not directly ask about the mass, I will also consider Question 5 and Question 6 as possible answers.

Since I have to choose one, I will choose Question 6 as the most similar, however I want to emphasize that the similarity is not very high.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the estimated number of Wukchumni speakers remaining today. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the exact number of speakers, Question 8: "What is Marie's concern about the future of her language?" touches on the topic of the language's survival and the potential loss of speakers.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the number of speakers or the language's endangered status. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ closely.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest:

 Question 8: What is Marie's concern about the future of her language?

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not provide a clear answer to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end
of the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier
and less productive, but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem. In order to predict how
the temperature will change, scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age 
since 1750 and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century. To do this, we need to know
two things: First, the global temperature rise
since 1750, and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models
that reliably simulate the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds, and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life. So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only
minute amounts, near one molecule per million million
molecules of air. This lack of understanding
is the main reason for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, "Cloud" has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence of galactic cosmic rays on clouds? Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.

Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end
of the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier
and less productive, but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem. In order to predict how
the temperature will change, scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age 
since 1750 and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century. To do this, we need to know
two things: First, the global temperature rise
since 1750, and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models
that reliably simulate the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds, and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life. So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only
minute amounts, near one molecule per million million
molecules of air. This lack of understanding
is the main reason for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, "Cloud" has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence of galactic cosmic rays on clouds? Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the expected increase of global mean temperature for a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 3 mentions the projected range of global temperature rise (1.5¬∞C) and its potential consequences.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question 3: If the global temperature rise is near the low end of the projected range (1.5¬∞C), what can be expected?**

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ in the sense that it mentions the projected range of global temperature rise, but it does not directly ask about the expected increase of global mean temperature for a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

To create a generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ, you could consider creating a new question that directly asks about the expected increase of global mean temperature for a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, with options that match the ground truth MCQ.

For example:

**New Generated MCQ:** What is the expected increase of global mean temperature for a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is expected to occur before the end of the 21st century?
Options: A. 0.1-0.8 C, B. 1.5-4.5 C, C. 5-10 C

This new generated MCQ more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end
of the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier
and less productive, but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem. In order to predict how
the temperature will change, scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age 
since 1750 and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century. To do this, we need to know
two things: First, the global temperature rise
since 1750, and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models
that reliably simulate the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds, and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life. So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only
minute amounts, near one molecule per million million
molecules of air. This lack of understanding
is the main reason for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, "Cloud" has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence of galactic cosmic rays on clouds? Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 9: How does the "Cloud" experiment at CERN address the uncertainty in climate sensitivity? is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, a closer match can be found in the options of Question 8 and the content of Question 9. 

But if we consider the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is about why it is better to do some experiments in the laboratory rather than in the real atmosphere, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of the context of the "Cloud" experiment at CERN.

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
How much can we really know about 
the universe beyond our galaxy? The Hubble Telescope has enabled us to see objects in space as far 
13,000,000,000 light years away. But this still doesn't give us the answers
to all our questions, questions like, "What is the universe
made of?" "Which elements are the most abundant?" "Does space contain undiscovered
forms of matter?" "Could there be antimatter stars
or galaxies?" Some of these questions cannot
be answered solely from visual images, but what if we had messengers
bringing us physical data from distant parts of the cosmos, beyond the reach of 
explorers or satellites? In a way, we do, and these 
"space messengers" are called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays were first discovered
in 1912 by Victor Hess when he set out to explore variations
in the atmosphere's level of radiation, which had been thought to
emanate from the Earth's crust. By taking measurements on board
a flying balloon during an eclipse, Hess demonstrated both that
the radiation actually increased at greater altitudes
and that the sun could not be its source. The startling conclusion was that 
it wasn't coming from anywhere within the Earth's atmosphere
but from outer space. Our universe is composed of many
astronomical objects. BIllions of stars of all sizes, black holes,
active galactic nuclei, astroids, planets and more. During violent disturbances, such as a
large star exploding into a supernova, billions of particles are 
emitted into space. Although they are called rays, cosmic rays consist of these 
high energy particles rather than the photons that
make up light rays. While the light from an explosion
travels in a straight line at its famous constant speed, the particles are trapped
in extraordinary loops by magnetic shockwaves 
generated by the explosion. Crossing back and forth
through these magnetic field lines accelerates them to almost the speed of
light before they escape. There are lots of cosmic rays in space,
and some of these particles have traveled for billions of years before reaching Earth. When they enter our atmosphere,
they collide with the molecules there, generating secondary cosmic rays, lighter particles with less energy
than the original. Most of these are absorbed 
into the atmosphere, but some are able to reach the ground,
even passing through our bodies. At sea level, this radiation is fairly low. But people who spend a lot of time
at higher altitudes, such as airline crews,
are exposed to much more. What makes cosmic rays
useful as messengers is that they carry the traces
of their origins. By studying the frequency
with which different particles occur, scientists are able to determine
the relative abundance of elements, such as hydrogen and helium,
within the universe. But cosmic rays may provide
even more fascinating information about the fabric of the universe itself. An experiment called
the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, A.M.S., has recently been installed on board
the International Space Station, containing several detectors that can
separately measure a cosmic ray particle's velocity,
trajectory, radiation, mass and energy, as well as whether the particle
is matter or antimatter. While the two are normally
indistinguishable, their opposite charges enable them
to be detected with the help of a magnet. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is
currently measuring 50 million particles per day with information about each particle being
sent in real time from the space station to the A.M.S. control room at CERN. Over the upcoming months and years, it's expected to yield both amazing
and useful information about antimatter, the possible existence of dark matter, and even possible ways
to mitigate the effects of cosmic radiation on space travel. As we stay tuned for new discoveries,
look to the sky on a clear night, and you may see the
International Space Station, where the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
receives the tiny messengers that carry cosmic secrets.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses Victor Hess or his discovery. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs mention Victor Hess.

However, if we consider the broader topic of cosmic rays, which is related to Victor Hess's discovery, we can find a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in content.

The most similar generated MCQ would be Question 2: What are referred to as "space messengers" that bring physical data from distant parts of the cosmos? Options: A. Satellites, B. Cosmic rays, C. Explorers, D. Asteroids Correct Option: B

This question is related to the topic of cosmic rays, which Victor Hess discovered. However, it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 2 is the most similar, but with a note that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What happens to the particles emitted by a supernova explosion when they interact with magnetic shockwaves generated by the explosion?

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with the behavior of cosmic rays in relation to magnetic fields. The ground truth MCQ asks about the path that cosmic rays follow in the galaxy, and the correct answer mentions that they are "trapped in extraordinary loops by the magnetic fields lines that fill the galaxy." Similarly, Question 4 asks about the interaction between particles emitted by a supernova and magnetic shockwaves, and the correct answer states that they are "accelerated to almost the speed of light."

While the questions are not identical, they both relate to the behavior of cosmic rays in the presence of magnetic fields, making Question 4 the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
How much can we really know about 
the universe beyond our galaxy? The Hubble Telescope has enabled us to see objects in space as far 
13,000,000,000 light years away. But this still doesn't give us the answers
to all our questions, questions like, "What is the universe
made of?" "Which elements are the most abundant?" "Does space contain undiscovered
forms of matter?" "Could there be antimatter stars
or galaxies?" Some of these questions cannot
be answered solely from visual images, but what if we had messengers
bringing us physical data from distant parts of the cosmos, beyond the reach of 
explorers or satellites? In a way, we do, and these 
"space messengers" are called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays were first discovered
in 1912 by Victor Hess when he set out to explore variations
in the atmosphere's level of radiation, which had been thought to
emanate from the Earth's crust. By taking measurements on board
a flying balloon during an eclipse, Hess demonstrated both that
the radiation actually increased at greater altitudes
and that the sun could not be its source. The startling conclusion was that 
it wasn't coming from anywhere within the Earth's atmosphere
but from outer space. Our universe is composed of many
astronomical objects. BIllions of stars of all sizes, black holes,
active galactic nuclei, astroids, planets and more. During violent disturbances, such as a
large star exploding into a supernova, billions of particles are 
emitted into space. Although they are called rays, cosmic rays consist of these 
high energy particles rather than the photons that
make up light rays. While the light from an explosion
travels in a straight line at its famous constant speed, the particles are trapped
in extraordinary loops by magnetic shockwaves 
generated by the explosion. Crossing back and forth
through these magnetic field lines accelerates them to almost the speed of
light before they escape. There are lots of cosmic rays in space,
and some of these particles have traveled for billions of years before reaching Earth. When they enter our atmosphere,
they collide with the molecules there, generating secondary cosmic rays, lighter particles with less energy
than the original. Most of these are absorbed 
into the atmosphere, but some are able to reach the ground,
even passing through our bodies. At sea level, this radiation is fairly low. But people who spend a lot of time
at higher altitudes, such as airline crews,
are exposed to much more. What makes cosmic rays
useful as messengers is that they carry the traces
of their origins. By studying the frequency
with which different particles occur, scientists are able to determine
the relative abundance of elements, such as hydrogen and helium,
within the universe. But cosmic rays may provide
even more fascinating information about the fabric of the universe itself. An experiment called
the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, A.M.S., has recently been installed on board
the International Space Station, containing several detectors that can
separately measure a cosmic ray particle's velocity,
trajectory, radiation, mass and energy, as well as whether the particle
is matter or antimatter. While the two are normally
indistinguishable, their opposite charges enable them
to be detected with the help of a magnet. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is
currently measuring 50 million particles per day with information about each particle being
sent in real time from the space station to the A.M.S. control room at CERN. Over the upcoming months and years, it's expected to yield both amazing
and useful information about antimatter, the possible existence of dark matter, and even possible ways
to mitigate the effects of cosmic radiation on space travel. As we stay tuned for new discoveries,
look to the sky on a clear night, and you may see the
International Space Station, where the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
receives the tiny messengers that carry cosmic secrets.

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that discusses the interaction between primary cosmic rays and the atmosphere.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that mentions the interaction between primary cosmic rays and the atmosphere, which is not explicitly present in the provided options.

If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that **none** of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to pick the closest one based on the topic of cosmic rays and their interaction, I would choose:

**Question 3: When a large star explodes into a supernova, what type of particles are emitted into space? Options: A. Photons (light rays), B. High-energy particles (cosmic rays), C. Gamma rays, D. X-rays Correct Option: B**

**Transcript**:
You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA. They encode the molecules that
make up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were
primitive microbes with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start
doing something useful, something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch. As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 20, Question 2
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA. They encode the molecules that
make up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were
primitive microbes with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match is not present among the provided generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 5, as it talks about the evolution of genes over time.

But since it's not a direct match, I'll provide a justification for this choice:

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of genes on Earth today compared to millions of years ago. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 5 discusses the evolution of genes over time, which is related to the concept of gene emergence and increase in number.

If I had to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question: What is the trend in the number of genes on Earth over millions of years? Options: A. Increasing, B. Decreasing, C. Remaining constant, D. Unknown Correct Option: A**

This new question directly matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

However, since I need to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will provide:

of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start
doing something useful, something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch. As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes.

**Transcript**:
Thinking of getting a tattoo? Decorating your birthday suit would add
another personal story to a history of tattoos stretching back
at least 8000 years. Tattooed mummies from around the world
attest to the universality of body modification
across the millennia, and to the fact that you really were
stuck with it forever if your civilization never got around
to inventing laser removal. A mummy from the Chinchorro culture
in pre-Incan Peru has a mustache tattooed
on his upper lip. √ñtzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has
patterned charcoal tats along his spine, behind his knee 
and around his ankles, which might be from an early
sort of acupuncture. The mummy of Amunet, a priestess 
in Middle Kingdom Egypt, features tattoos thought to symbolize
sexuality and fertility. Even older than the mummies, figurines of seemingly tattooed
people, and tools possibly used for tattooing
date back tens of thousands of years. Tattoos don't have one historical
origin point that we know of, but why do we English speakers
call them all tattoos? The word is an anglophonic modification
of "tatao," a Polynesian word used in Tahiti, where English captain James Cook
landed in 1769 and encountered heavily tattooed
men and women. Stories of Cook's findings
and the tattoos his crew acquired cemented our usage of "tattoo" 
over previous words like "scarring," "painting," and "staining," and sparked a craze in Victorian
English high society. We might think of Victorians
having Victorian attitudes about such a risque thing, and you can find such sentiments, and even
bans, on tattooing throughout history. But while publicly some Brits looked down
their noses at tattoos, behind closed doors 
and away from their noses, lots of people had them. Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger
fighting a python, and tattoos became very popular
among Cook's fellow soldiers, who used them to note their travels. You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor. Been south of the Equator?
Time for your turtle tat. But Westerners sported tattoos 
long before meeting the Samoans and Maori 
of the South Pacific. Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross
so if they died in battle, they'd get a Christian burial. Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall
had military tattoos and called the Picts beyond it "Picts,"
for the pictures painted on them. There's also a long tradition
of people being tattooed unwillingly. Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves
and mercenaries to discourage escape and desertion. Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such
as far back as the 7th century. Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed
numbers on the chest or arms of Jews and other prisoners
at the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify stripped corpses. But tattoos forced on prisoners
and outcasts can be redefined as people take ownership
of that status or history. Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore
short sleeves to Germany after the war to remind people of the crime
his number represented. Today, some Holocaust 
survivors' descendants have their relatives numbers'
tattooed on their arms. The Torah has rules against tattoos, but what if you want to make indelible
what you feel should never be forgotten? And those criminals and outcasts of Japan,
where tattooing was eventually outlawed from the mid-19th century to 
just after World War II, added decoration to their penal tattoos, with designs borrowed from
woodblock prints, popular literature and mythical spirtual iconography. Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos
as signs of lifelong loyalty and courage. After all, they lasted forever
and it really hurt to get them. For the Maori, those tattoos were an
accepted mainstream tradition. If you shied away from the excruciating
chiseling in of your moko design, your unfinished tattoo marked
your cowardice. Today, unless you go the traditional route, your tattoo artist will probably use
a tattoo machine based on the one patented by
Samuel O'Reilly in 1891, itself based on Thomas Edison's
stencil machine from 1876. But with the incredibly broad history
of tattoos giving you so many options, what are you going to get? This is a bold-lined expression of
who you are, or you want to appear to be. As the naturalist aboard Cook's ship
said of the tataoed Tahitians, "Everyone is marked, thus in different
parts of his body, according maybe to his humor
or different circumstances of his life." Maybe your particular humor
and circumstances suggest getting a symbol
of cultural heritage, a sign of spirituality,
sexual energy, or good old-fashioned
avant-garde defiance. A reminder of a great accomplishment, or of how you think it would look
cool if Hulk Hogan rode a Rhino. It's your expression, your body, 
so it's your call. Just two rules: you have to find a tattooist who
won't be ashamed to draw your idea, and when in doubt, 
you can never go wrong with "Mom."

**Transcript**:
Thinking of getting a tattoo? Decorating your birthday suit would add
another personal story to a history of tattoos stretching back
at least 8000 years. Tattooed mummies from around the world
attest to the universality of body modification
across the millennia, and to the fact that you really were
stuck with it forever if your civilization never got around
to inventing laser removal. A mummy from the Chinchorro culture
in pre-Incan Peru has a mustache tattooed
on his upper lip. √ñtzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has
patterned charcoal tats along his spine, behind his knee 
and around his ankles, which might be from an early
sort of acupuncture. The mummy of Amunet, a priestess 
in Middle Kingdom Egypt, features tattoos thought to symbolize
sexuality and fertility. Even older than the mummies, figurines of seemingly tattooed
people, and tools possibly used for tattooing
date back tens of thousands of years. Tattoos don't have one historical
origin point that we know of, but why do we English speakers
call them all tattoos? The word is an anglophonic modification
of "tatao," a Polynesian word used in Tahiti, where English captain James Cook
landed in 1769 and encountered heavily tattooed
men and women. Stories of Cook's findings
and the tattoos his crew acquired cemented our usage of "tattoo" 
over previous words like "scarring," "painting," and "staining," and sparked a craze in Victorian
English high society. We might think of Victorians
having Victorian attitudes about such a risque thing, and you can find such sentiments, and even
bans, on tattooing throughout history. But while publicly some Brits looked down
their noses at tattoos, behind closed doors 
and away from their noses, lots of people had them. Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger
fighting a python, and tattoos became very popular
among Cook's fellow soldiers, who used them to note their travels. You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor. Been south of the Equator?
Time for your turtle tat. But Westerners sported tattoos 
long before meeting the Samoans and Maori 
of the South Pacific. Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross
so if they died in battle, they'd get a Christian burial. Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall
had military tattoos and called the Picts beyond it "Picts,"
for the pictures painted on them. There's also a long tradition
of people being tattooed unwillingly. Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves
and mercenaries to discourage escape and desertion. Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such
as far back as the 7th century. Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed
numbers on the chest or arms of Jews and other prisoners
at the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify stripped corpses. But tattoos forced on prisoners
and outcasts can be redefined as people take ownership
of that status or history. Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore
short sleeves to Germany after the war to remind people of the crime
his number represented. Today, some Holocaust 
survivors' descendants have their relatives numbers'
tattooed on their arms. The Torah has rules against tattoos, but what if you want to make indelible
what you feel should never be forgotten? And those criminals and outcasts of Japan,
where tattooing was eventually outlawed from the mid-19th century to 
just after World War II, added decoration to their penal tattoos, with designs borrowed from
woodblock prints, popular literature and mythical spirtual iconography. Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos
as signs of lifelong loyalty and courage. After all, they lasted forever
and it really hurt to get them. For the Maori, those tattoos were an
accepted mainstream tradition. If you shied away from the excruciating
chiseling in of your moko design, your unfinished tattoo marked
your cowardice. Today, unless you go the traditional route, your tattoo artist will probably use
a tattoo machine based on the one patented by
Samuel O'Reilly in 1891, itself based on Thomas Edison's
stencil machine from 1876. But with the incredibly broad history
of tattoos giving you so many options, what are you going to get? This is a bold-lined expression of
who you are, or you want to appear to be. As the naturalist aboard Cook's ship
said of the tataoed Tahitians, "Everyone is marked, thus in different
parts of his body, according maybe to his humor
or different circumstances of his life." Maybe your particular humor
and circumstances suggest getting a symbol
of cultural heritage, a sign of spirituality,
sexual energy, or good old-fashioned
avant-garde defiance. A reminder of a great accomplishment, or of how you think it would look
cool if Hulk Hogan rode a Rhino. It's your expression, your body, 
so it's your call. Just two rules: you have to find a tattooist who
won't be ashamed to draw your idea, and when in doubt, 
you can never go wrong with "Mom."

**Transcript**:
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture. It says that you can never simultaneously
know the exact position and the exact speed of an object
and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism
to sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result
of measurement, that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa. The real origin is much deeper
and more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position
and exact speed of an object have no meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means
to behave like a particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time. We can represent this by a graph
showing the probability of finding the object at a particular place,
which looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position,
and zero everywhere else. Waves, on the other hand,
are disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering 
the surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features
of the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two 
neighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability of 
being in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for
quantum physics because an object's wavelength
is related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to 
a very short wavelength. A heavy object has lots of momentum
even if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength. This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a 
trillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect. Small things, 
like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough
to measure in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, 
we can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum,
but it has no position. We can know a particles position
very well, but it doesn't have a wavelength,
so we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both position
and momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves,
but only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves 
with different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some
possibility of having different momenta. When we add two waves, 
we find that there are places where the peaks line up,
making a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one
fill in the valleys of the other. The result has regions where
we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out
get bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still,
with the wavier regions becoming narrower. If we keep adding waves,
we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength
in one small region. That's a quantum object with both
wave and particle nature, but to accomplish this,
we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't restricted 
to a single point. There's a good probability
of finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet
by adding lots of waves, which means there's 
some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding
to any one of those. Both position and momentum
are now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected. If you want to reduce 
the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet,
you need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want to know the momentum better,
you need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927. This uncertainty isn't a matter
of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result
of combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just 
a practical limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties 
an object can have, built into the fundamental structure
of the universe itself.

by adding lots of waves, which means there's 
some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding
to any one of those. Both position and momentum
are now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected. If you want to reduce 
the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet,
you need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want to know the momentum better,
you need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927. This uncertainty isn't a matter
of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result
of combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just 
a practical limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties 
an object can have, built into the fundamental structure
of the universe itself.

**Transcript**:
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture. It says that you can never simultaneously
know the exact position and the exact speed of an object
and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism
to sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result
of measurement, that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa. The real origin is much deeper
and more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position
and exact speed of an object have no meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means
to behave like a particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time. We can represent this by a graph
showing the probability of finding the object at a particular place,
which looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position,
and zero everywhere else. Waves, on the other hand,
are disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering 
the surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features
of the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two 
neighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability of 
being in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for
quantum physics because an object's wavelength
is related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to 
a very short wavelength. A heavy object has lots of momentum
even if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength. This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a 
trillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect. Small things, 
like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough
to measure in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, 
we can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum,
but it has no position. We can know a particles position
very well, but it doesn't have a wavelength,
so we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both position
and momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves,
but only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves 
with different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some
possibility of having different momenta. When we add two waves, 
we find that there are places where the peaks line up,
making a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one
fill in the valleys of the other. The result has regions where
we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out
get bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still,
with the wavier regions becoming narrower. If we keep adding waves,
we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength
in one small region. That's a quantum object with both
wave and particle nature, but to accomplish this,
we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't restricted 
to a single point. There's a good probability
of finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet
by adding lots of waves, which means there's 
some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not directly address the wave behavior in electrons, it provides the underlying reason why we don't typically notice the wave nature of everyday objects, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly compares the wave behavior of electrons to that of larger objects, such as baseballs. Since this is not available, Question 5 is the closest match.

Here's why other questions don't match as closely:

- Questions 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 discuss the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, its origin, and implications but do not specifically address the wave behavior of electrons versus larger objects.
- Question 4 addresses the relationship between wavelength and momentum but does not directly compare electrons to baseballs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

in physics is this: everything in the universe, from light
to electrons to atoms, behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. All of the other weird stuff you might
have heard about quantum physics, Schrodinger's Cat, God playing dice,
spooky action at a distance, all of it follows directly from the fact that everything has both 
particle and wave nature. This might sound crazy. If you look around, you'll see waves
in water and particles of rock, and they're nothing alike. So why would you think to combine them? Physicists didn't just decide to mash
these things together out of no where. Rather, they were led to 
the dual nature of the universe through a process of small steps, fitting together lots of bits of evidence,
like pieces in a puzzle. The first person to seriously 
suggest the dual nature of light was Albert Einstein in 1905, but he was picking up an 
earlier idea from Max Planck. Planck explained the colors of light
emitted by hot objects, like the filament in a light bulb, but to do it, he needed a desperate trick: he said the object was 
made up of oscillators that could only emit light
in discrete chunks, units of energy that depend on 
the frequency of the light. Planck was never really happy with this,
but Einstein picked it up and ran with it. He applied Planck's idea to light itself,
saying that light, which everybody knew was a wave,
is really a stream of photons, each with a discrete amount of energy. Einstein himself called this
the only truly revolutionary thing he did, but it explains the way light shining on 
a metal surface knocks loose electrons. Even people who hated the idea
had to agree that it works brilliantly. The next puzzle piece came from 
Ernest Rutherford in England. In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,
working for Rutherford, shot alpha particles at gold atoms and were stunned to find that some
bounced straight backwards. This showed that most of the mass of the 
atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus. The cartoon atom you learn 
in grade school, with electrons orbiting
like a miniature solar system, that's Rutherford's. There's one little problem with
Rutherford's atom: it can't work. Classical physics tells us
that an electron whipping around in a circle emits light, and we use this all the time
to generate radio waves and X-rays. Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays
in all directions for a brief instant before the electron spirals in
to crash into the nucleus. But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical
physicist working with Rutherford, pointed out that atoms obviously exist, so maybe the rules of physics 
needed to change. Bohr proposed that an electron
in certain special orbits doesn't emit any light at all. Atoms absorb and emit light
only when electrons change orbits, and the frequency of the light
depends on the energy difference in just the way Planck
and Einstein introduced. Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem and explains why atoms emit only
very specific colors of light. Each element has its own special orbits, and thus its own unique
set of frequencies. The Bohr model has one tiny problem: there's no reason for 
those orbits to be special. But Louis de Broglie, 
a French PhD student, brought everything full circle. He pointed out that if light,
which everyone knew is a wave, behaves like a particle, maybe the electron, 
which everyone knew is a particle, behaves like a wave. And if electrons are waves, it's easy to explain Bohr's rule
for picking out the special orbits. Once you have the idea that 
electrons behave like waves, you can go look for it. And within a few years, 
scientists in the US and UK had observed wave behavior from electrons. These days we have a wonderfully clear
demonstration of this: shooting single electrons at a barrier
with slits cut in it. Each electron is detected 
at a specific place at a specific time, like a particle. But when you repeat the experiment
many times, all the individual electrons trace out
a pattern of stripes, characteristic of wave behavior. The idea that particles behave like waves,
and vice versa, is one of the strangest
and most powerful in physics. Richard Feynman famously said that this illustrates the central mystery
of quantum mechanics. Everything else follows from this, like pieces of a puzzle 
falling into place.

**Transcript**:
One of the most amazing facts 
in physics is this: everything in the universe, from light
to electrons to atoms, behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. All of the other weird stuff you might
have heard about quantum physics, Schrodinger's Cat, God playing dice,
spooky action at a distance, all of it follows directly from the fact that everything has both 
particle and wave nature. This might sound crazy. If you look around, you'll see waves
in water and particles of rock, and they're nothing alike. So why would you think to combine them? Physicists didn't just decide to mash
these things together out of no where. Rather, they were led to 
the dual nature of the universe through a process of small steps, fitting together lots of bits of evidence,
like pieces in a puzzle. The first person to seriously 
suggest the dual nature of light was Albert Einstein in 1905, but he was picking up an 
earlier idea from Max Planck. Planck explained the colors of light
emitted by hot objects, like the filament in a light bulb, but to do it, he needed a desperate trick: he said the object was 
made up of oscillators that could only emit light
in discrete chunks, units of energy that depend on 
the frequency of the light. Planck was never really happy with this,
but Einstein picked it up and ran with it. He applied Planck's idea to light itself,
saying that light, which everybody knew was a wave,
is really a stream of photons, each with a discrete amount of energy. Einstein himself called this
the only truly revolutionary thing he did, but it explains the way light shining on 
a metal surface knocks loose electrons. Even people who hated the idea
had to agree that it works brilliantly. The next puzzle piece came from 
Ernest Rutherford in England. In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,
working for Rutherford, shot alpha particles at gold atoms and were stunned to find that some
bounced straight backwards. This showed that most of the mass of the 
atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus. The cartoon atom you learn 
in grade school, with electrons orbiting
like a miniature solar system, that's Rutherford's. There's one little problem with
Rutherford's atom: it can't work. Classical physics tells us
that an electron whipping around in a circle emits light, and we use this all the time
to generate radio waves and X-rays. Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays
in all directions for a brief instant before the electron spirals in
to crash into the nucleus. But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical
physicist working with Rutherford, pointed out that atoms obviously exist, so maybe the rules of physics 
needed to change. Bohr proposed that an electron
in certain special orbits doesn't emit any light at all. Atoms absorb and emit light
only when electrons change orbits, and the frequency of the light
depends on the energy difference in just the way Planck
and Einstein introduced. Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem and explains why atoms emit only
very specific colors of light. Each element has its own special orbits, and thus its own unique
set of frequencies. The Bohr model has one tiny problem: there's no reason for 
those orbits to be special. But Louis de Broglie, 
a French PhD student, brought everything full circle. He pointed out that if light,
which everyone knew is a wave, behaves like a particle, maybe the electron, 
which everyone knew is a particle, behaves like a wave. And if electrons are waves, it's easy to explain Bohr's rule
for picking out the special orbits. Once you have the idea that 
electrons behave like waves, you can go look for it. And within a few years, 
scientists in the US and UK had observed wave behavior from electrons. These days we have a wonderfully clear
demonstration of this: shooting single electrons at a barrier
with slits cut in it. Each electron is detected 
at a specific place at a specific time, like a particle. But when you repeat the experiment
many times, all the individual electrons trace out
a pattern of stripes, characteristic of wave behavior. The idea that particles behave like waves,
and vice versa, is one of the strangest
and most powerful in physics. Richard Feynman famously said that this illustrates the central mystery
of quantum mechanics. Everything else follows from this, like pieces of a puzzle 
falling into place.

**Transcript**:
So you just strained a muscle
and the inflammation is unbearable. You wish you had something 
ice-cold to dull the pain, but to use an ice pack, you would have had
to put it in the freezer hours ago. Fortunately, there's another option. A cold pack can be left at room temperature
until the moment you need it, then just snap it as instructed
and within seconds you'll feel the chill. But how can something go from 
room temperature to near freezing in such a short time? The answer lies in chemistry. Your cold pack contains water
and a solid compound, usually ammonium nitrate, in different
compartments separated by a barrier. When the barrier is broken,
the solid dissolves causing what's known as an 
endothermic reaction, one that absorbs heat from its surroundings. To understand how this works, we need to look at the two driving forces
behind chemical processes: energetics and entropy. These determine whether a change occurs in
a system and how energy flows if it does. In chemistry, energetics deals with
the attractive and repulsive forces between particles at the molecular level. This scale is so small that there are
more water molecules in a single glass than there are known stars in the universe. And all of these trillions 
of molecules are constantly moving, vibrating 
and rotating at different rates. We can think of temperature as
a measurement of the average motion, or kinetic energy, of all these particles, with an increase in movement
meaning an increase in temperature, and vice versa. The flow of heat in any 
chemical transformation depends on the relative strength
of particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states. When particles have a strong mutual
attractive force, they move rapidly towards one another,
until they get so close, that repulsive forces push them away. If the initial attraction was 
strong enough, the particles will keep vibrating back
and forth in this way. The stronger the attraction,
the faster their movement, and since heat is essentially motion, when a substance changes to a state
in which these interactions are stronger, the system heats up. But our cold packs do the opposite, which means that when 
the solid dissolves in the water, the new interactions of solid particles 
and water molecules with each other are weaker than the separate interactions
that existed before. This makes both types of particles 
slow down on average, cooling the whole solution. But why would a substance change to a
state where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting
interactions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes 
how objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,
there are many different possible arrangements for the trillions of particles 
that compose it. Some of these will have all 
the oxygen molecules in one area, and all the nitrogen molecules in another. But far more will have them 
mixed together, which is why air is always
found in this state. Now, if there are strong
attractive forces between particles, the probability of some configurations
can change even to the point where the odds
don't favor certain substances mixing. Oil and water not mixing is an example. But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,
or other substance in your cold pack, the attractive forces are not 
strong enough to change the odds, and random motion makes the particles
composing the solid separate by dissolving into the water
and never returning to their solid state. To put it simply, your cold pack gets 
cold because random motion creates more configurations where 
the solid and water mix together and all of these have even weaker
particle interaction, less overall particle movement, and less heat than there was 
inside the unused pack. So while the disorder that can result
from entropy may have caused your injury
in the first place, its also responsible for that
comforting cold that soothes your pain.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

This question is about the relationship between the flow of heat in a chemical transformation and particle interactions, which is closely related to the concept of energetics. The correct option, A, states that "The flow of heat depends on the relative strength of particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states," which aligns with the ground truth MCQ's correct option, A, "The strength of attractive and repulsive forces between the substances."

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about the definition of energetics. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

That being said, another question that comes close is Question 4, which asks about the two factors that determine whether a change occurs in a system and how energy flows if it does. The correct option, A, mentions "Energetics and entropy," which is related to the concept of energetics.

Between Questions 4 and 5, Question 4 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, as it directly mentions energetics, whereas Question 5 is more related to the concept of energetics but does not directly ask about it.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

more water molecules in a single glass than there are known stars in the universe. And all of these trillions 
of molecules are constantly moving, vibrating 
and rotating at different rates. We can think of temperature as
a measurement of the average motion, or kinetic energy, of all these particles, with an increase in movement
meaning an increase in temperature, and vice versa. The flow of heat in any 
chemical transformation depends on the relative strength
of particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states. When particles have a strong mutual
attractive force, they move rapidly towards one another,
until they get so close, that repulsive forces push them away. If the initial attraction was 
strong enough, the particles will keep vibrating back
and forth in this way. The stronger the attraction,
the faster their movement, and since heat is essentially motion, when a substance changes to a state
in which these interactions are stronger, the system heats up. But our cold packs do the opposite, which means that when 
the solid dissolves in the water, the new interactions of solid particles 
and water molecules with each other are weaker than the separate interactions
that existed before. This makes both types of particles 
slow down on average, cooling the whole solution. But why would a substance change to a
state where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting
interactions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes 
how objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,
there are many different possible arrangements for the trillions of particles 
that compose it. Some of these will have all 
the oxygen molecules in one area, and all the nitrogen molecules in another. But far more will have them 
mixed together, which is why air is always
found in this state. Now, if there are strong
attractive forces between particles, the probability of some configurations
can change even to the point where the odds
don't favor certain substances mixing. Oil and water not mixing is an example. But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,
or other substance in your cold pack, the attractive forces are not 
strong enough to change the odds, and random motion makes the particles
composing the solid separate by dissolving into the water
and never returning to their solid state. To put it simply, your cold pack gets 
cold because random motion creates more configurations where 
the solid and water mix together and all of these have even weaker
particle interaction, less overall particle movement, and less heat than there was 
inside the unused pack. So while the disorder that can result
from entropy may have caused your injury
in the first place, its also responsible for that
comforting cold that soothes your pain.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of discussing the properties of molecules is:

Question 5: How does the flow of heat in a chemical transformation relate to particle interactions?

Although this question does not directly address the number of water molecules in a glass of water, it does discuss the behavior of particles and their interactions, which is related to the concept presented in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but I want to emphasize that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
So you just strained a muscle
and the inflammation is unbearable. You wish you had something 
ice-cold to dull the pain, but to use an ice pack, you would have had
to put it in the freezer hours ago. Fortunately, there's another option. A cold pack can be left at room temperature
until the moment you need it, then just snap it as instructed
and within seconds you'll feel the chill. But how can something go from 
room temperature to near freezing in such a short time? The answer lies in chemistry. Your cold pack contains water
and a solid compound, usually ammonium nitrate, in different
compartments separated by a barrier. When the barrier is broken,
the solid dissolves causing what's known as an 
endothermic reaction, one that absorbs heat from its surroundings. To understand how this works, we need to look at the two driving forces
behind chemical processes: energetics and entropy. These determine whether a change occurs in
a system and how energy flows if it does. In chemistry, energetics deals with
the attractive and repulsive forces between particles at the molecular level. This scale is so small that there are

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What role does entropy play in the process of a cold pack getting cold?

However, the options provided in Question 6 do not exactly match the definition of entropy provided in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks for the definition of entropy.

Among the provided generated MCQs, none directly ask for the definition of entropy. However, Question 4 mentions entropy as one of the factors that determine whether a change occurs in a system and how energy flows if it does.

Considering the available options, Question 6 is the closest match in terms of intent, but it does not provide a direct definition of entropy. If we prioritize the options and content, Question 4 is a better match, as it mentions entropy in the context of its role in a system, which is closer to the definition provided in the ground truth MCQ.

Given the trade-off between intent and content, I would recommend Question 6 as the closest match, but with the caveat that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, since the instructions require a single index, I will provide the index of Question 6.

**Transcript**:
In 1861, two scientists got into
a very brainy argument. Specifically, they had opposing ideas
of how speech and memory operated within the human brain. Ernest Aubertin, 
with his localistic model, argued that a particular region
or the brain was devoted to each separate process. Pierre Gratiolet, on the other hand,
argued for the distributed model, where different regions work together to accomplish all of these 
various functions. The debate they began reverberated
throughout the rest of the century, involving some of the greatest scientific
minds of the time. Aubertin and his localistic model
had some big names on his side. In the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes
had assigned the quality of free will and the human soul
to the pineal gland. And in the late 18th century, a young
student named Franz Joseph Gall had observed that the best memorizers
in his class had the most prominent eyes and decided that this was due 
to higher development in the adjacent part of the brain. As a physician, Gall went on to establish
the study of phrenology, which held that strong mental faculties
corresponded to highly developed brain regions, observable
as bumps in the skull. The widespread popularity of phrenology
throughout the early 19th century tipped the scales towards 
Aubertin's localism. But the problem was that Gall had never
bothered to scientifically test whether the individual brain maps
he had constructed applied to all people. And in the 1840's, Pierre Flourens
challenged phrenology by selectively destroying parts
of animal brains and observing which functions were lost. Flourens found that damaging the cortex interfered with judgement or movement
in general, but failed to identify any region
associated with one specific function, concluding that the cortex carried out
brain functions as an entire unit. Flourens had scored a victory 
for Gratiolet, but it was not to last. Gall's former student, 
Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, challenged Flourens' conclusion, observing that patients 
with speech disorders all had damage to the frontal lobe. And after Paul Broca's 1861 autopsy of a
patient who had lost the power to produce speech, but not the power
to understand it, revealed highly localized 
frontal lobe damage, the distributed model seemed doomed. Localism took off. In the 1870's, Karl Wernicke associated
part of the left temporal lobe with speech comprehension. Soon after, Eduard Hitzig and 
Gustav Fritsch stimulated a dog's cortex and discovered
a frontal lobe region responsible for muscular movements. Building on their work, David Ferrier
mapped each piece of cortex associated with moving a part of the body. And in 1909, Korbinian Brodmann built
his own cortex map with 52 separate areas. It appeared that the victory of Aubertin's
localistic model was sealed. But neurologist Karl Wernicke had come up
with an interesting idea. He reasoned that since the regions for
speech production and comprehension were not adjacent, then injuring the area 
connecting them might result in a special type of language loss,
now known as receptive aphasia. Wernicke's connectionist model helped
explain disorders that didn't result from the dysfunction 
of just one area. Modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain
more complex than Gratiolet, Aubertin,
or even Wernicke imagined. Today, the hippocampus is associated
with two distinct brain functions: creating memories and processing
location in space. We also now measure 
two kinds of connectivity: anatomical connectivity between 
two adjoining regions of cortex working together, and functional connectivity 
between separated regions working together to
accomplish one process. A seemingly basic function like vision is actually composed 
of many smaller functions, with different parts 
of the cortex representing shape, color and location in space. When certain areas stop functioning,
we may recognize an object, but not see it, or vice versa. There are even different kinds of memory
for facts and for routines. And remembering something 
like your first bicycle involves a network of different regions
each representing the concept of vehicles, the bicycle's shape, 
the sound of the bell, and the emotions associated 
with that memory. In the end, both Gratiolet and Aubertin
turned out to be right. And we still use both of their models
to understand how cognition happens. For example, we can now measure brain
activity on such a fine time scale that we can see the individual localized
processes that comprise a single act of remembering. But it is the integration of these
different processes and regions that creates the coherent memory
we experience. The supposedly competing theories
prove to be two aspects of a more comprehensive model, which will in turn be revised and refined as our scientific techologies and methods
for understanding the brain improve.

**Transcript**:
In 1861, two scientists got into
a very brainy argument. Specifically, they had opposing ideas
of how speech and memory operated within the human brain. Ernest Aubertin, 
with his localistic model, argued that a particular region
or the brain was devoted to each separate process. Pierre Gratiolet, on the other hand,
argued for the distributed model, where different regions work together to accomplish all of these 
various functions. The debate they began reverberated
throughout the rest of the century, involving some of the greatest scientific
minds of the time. Aubertin and his localistic model
had some big names on his side. In the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes
had assigned the quality of free will and the human soul
to the pineal gland. And in the late 18th century, a young
student named Franz Joseph Gall had observed that the best memorizers
in his class had the most prominent eyes and decided that this was due 
to higher development in the adjacent part of the brain. As a physician, Gall went on to establish
the study of phrenology, which held that strong mental faculties
corresponded to highly developed brain regions, observable
as bumps in the skull. The widespread popularity of phrenology
throughout the early 19th century tipped the scales towards 
Aubertin's localism. But the problem was that Gall had never
bothered to scientifically test whether the individual brain maps
he had constructed applied to all people. And in the 1840's, Pierre Flourens
challenged phrenology by selectively destroying parts
of animal brains and observing which functions were lost. Flourens found that damaging the cortex interfered with judgement or movement
in general, but failed to identify any region
associated with one specific function, concluding that the cortex carried out
brain functions as an entire unit. Flourens had scored a victory 
for Gratiolet, but it was not to last. Gall's former student, 
Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, challenged Flourens' conclusion, observing that patients 
with speech disorders all had damage to the frontal lobe. And after Paul Broca's 1861 autopsy of a
patient who had lost the power to produce speech, but not the power
to understand it, revealed highly localized 
frontal lobe damage, the distributed model seemed doomed. Localism took off. In the 1870's, Karl Wernicke associated
part of the left temporal lobe with speech comprehension. Soon after, Eduard Hitzig and 
Gustav Fritsch stimulated a dog's cortex and discovered
a frontal lobe region responsible for muscular movements. Building on their work, David Ferrier
mapped each piece of cortex associated with moving a part of the body. And in 1909, Korbinian Brodmann built
his own cortex map with 52 separate areas. It appeared that the victory of Aubertin's
localistic model was sealed. But neurologist Karl Wernicke had come up
with an interesting idea. He reasoned that since the regions for
speech production and comprehension were not adjacent, then injuring the area 
connecting them might result in a special type of language loss,
now known as receptive aphasia. Wernicke's connectionist model helped
explain disorders that didn't result from the dysfunction 
of just one area. Modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain
more complex than Gratiolet, Aubertin,
or even Wernicke imagined. Today, the hippocampus is associated
with two distinct brain functions: creating memories and processing
location in space. We also now measure 
two kinds of connectivity: anatomical connectivity between 
two adjoining regions of cortex working together, and functional connectivity 
between separated regions working together to
accomplish one process. A seemingly basic function like vision is actually composed 
of many smaller functions, with different parts 
of the cortex representing shape, color and location in space. When certain areas stop functioning,
we may recognize an object, but not see it, or vice versa. There are even different kinds of memory
for facts and for routines. And remembering something 
like your first bicycle involves a network of different regions
each representing the concept of vehicles, the bicycle's shape, 
the sound of the bell, and the emotions associated 
with that memory. In the end, both Gratiolet and Aubertin
turned out to be right. And we still use both of their models
to understand how cognition happens. For example, we can now measure brain
activity on such a fine time scale that we can see the individual localized
processes that comprise a single act of remembering. But it is the integration of these
different processes and regions that creates the coherent memory
we experience. The supposedly competing theories
prove to be two aspects of a more comprehensive model, which will in turn be revised and refined as our scientific techologies and methods
for understanding the brain improve.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Remember the time you fell off your bike
or bumped your head on a sharp corner? Childhood injuries are things
we'd often like to forget, but our bodies often carry the memories
in the form of scars. So what are these unwanted souvenirs
and why do we keep them for so long after that unintended vacation
to the emergency room? The most common place we see scars
are on our skin, a patch that looks slightly different
from the normal skin around it. Often, this is considered
an unfortunate disfigurement, while other times, deliberate
scarification has been used in both traditional and modern cultures,
to mark a rite of passage or simply for aesthetic decoration. But the difference isn't only cosmetic. When we look at healthy skin tissue
under a microscope, we see the cells that perform
various functions connected by an extracellular
matrix, or ECM. This is composed of structural proteins,
like collagen, secreted by specialized fibroblast cells. Well-arranged ECM allows for
transportation of nutrients, cell-to-cell communication,
and cell adhesion. But when a deep wound occurs,
this arrangement is disrupted. During the process of wound healing,
collagen is redeposited at the wound site, but instead of the basket-weave formation
found in healthy tissue, the new ECM is aligned
in a single direction, impeding inter-cell processes,
and reducing durability and elasticity. To make matters worse, the healed tissue contains
a higher proportion of ECM than before, reducing its overall function. In the skin, the overabundance of collagen
interferes with its original functions, like producing sweat, controlling body temperature and even growing hair. The scar tissue is fragile, sensitive
to changes in temperature and sensation, and should be kept in moist environments
to maximize healing. This presence of excessive
fibrous connective tissue in an organ is known as fibrosis,
and if that term sounds familiar, it's because our skin is not the only
organ vulnerable to scarring. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder
that causes scarring of the pancreas, while pulmonary fibrosis
is a scarring of the lungs, resulting in shortness of breath. Scarring of the heart and the buildup
of ECM following a heart attack can inhibit its beating,
leading to further heart problems. What's common to all these conditions is that although it retains some
of the original functions, the scar tissue formed after a wound is inferior to the native tissue
it replaces. However, there is hope. Medical researchers are now studying
what causes fibroblast cells to secrete excessive amounts of collagen and how we can recruit
the body's other cells in regenerating and repopulating
the damaged tissue. By learning how to better control wound
healing and the formation of scar tissue, we can utilize
the multi-billion-dollar budgets currently used to address
the aftermath of wounding in a much more efficient manner, and help millions of people live better
and healthier lives. But until then, at least some of our scars can help us remember to avoid
the sorts of things that cause them.

have different characteristics, much of this surface performs
similar functions, such as sweating, feeling heat and cold,
and growing hair. But after a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different
from the surrounding area, and may not fully regain all 
its abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to
look at the structure of the human skin. The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly of hardened cells,
called keratinocytes, and provides protection. Since its outer layer is constantly being
shed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair. But sometimes a wound penetrates
into the dermis, which contains blood vessels
and the various glands and nerve endings that enable the skin's many functions. And when that happens, it triggers the
four overlapping stages of the regenerative process. The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's
response to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of 
the epidermis has been compromised. As the blood vessels tighten to minimize
the bleeding, in a process known as 
vasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming
a blood clot. A special protein known as fibrin forms
cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out
and bacteria or pathogens from getting in. After about three hours of this,
the skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation. With bleeding under control
and the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any
pathogens that may have gotten through. Among the most important of these
are white blood cells, known as macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue
through a process known as phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors
to spur healing. And because these tiny soldiers 
need to travel through the blood to 
get to the wound site, the previously constricted 
blood vessels now expand in a process called vasodilation. About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs, when 
fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound. In the process of collagen deposition, they produce a fibrous protein 
called collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue
to replace the fibrin from before. As epidermal cells divide to reform
the outer layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound. Finally, in the fourth stage 
of remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited
collagen is rearranged and converted into specific types. Through this process,
which can take over a year, the tensile strength of the new skin
is improved, and blood vessels and other connections
are strengthened. With time, the new tissue 
can reach from 50-80% of some of its original healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial 
wound and on the function itself. But because the skin
does not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical
issue for doctors around the world. And even though researchers have made
significant strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries
remain unresolved. For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive
from the blood vessels or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound? And why do some other mammals, 
such as deer, heal their wounds much more efficiently
and completely than humans? By finding the answers to these questions
and others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves
so well that scars will be just a memory.

**Transcript**:
Long before Descartes famously declared,
"I think, therefore I am," and long after that, scientists and philosophers alike have puzzled over what they call
the mind-body problem. Is the mind some separate, non-material
entity piloting a machine of flesh? Or if it's just a particularly elusive part
of our physical body, how can it translate the input of our
animal senses into the seemingly non-physical
experiences that we call thoughts? But though the answers have been
debated endlessly, new research suggests that
part of the problem lies in how we pose the question 
in the first place, assuming a distinction between our
sensory perception and our ideas that may not really be there. The traditional model of our mental
function has been that the senses provide
separate data to our brain which are then translated into the 
appropriate mental phenomena: visual images into trees, auditory
experiences into bird songs, and so on. But occasionally, 
we have come across people whose senses seem to mingle together,
allowing them to hear colors, or taste sounds. Until recently, the common understanding
was that this phenomenon, called synesthesia, was a direct connection between the
parts of the brain responsible for sensory stimuli such as seeing the color yellow immediately
upon hearing the tone of b flat. But newer studies have 
shown that synesthesia is actually mediated through our 
understanding of the shapes, colors and sounds
that our senses apprehend. In order for the cross-sensory
experiences to occur, the higher level ideas and concepts
that our minds associate with the sensory input must be activated. For example, this shape can be seen as
either the letter "s" or the number "5," and synesthetes associate each with 
different colors or sounds based on how they interpret it despite the purely visual stimulus 
remaining identical. In another study, synesthetes created
novel color associations for unfamiliar letters after learning
what the letters were. So because it relies on a connection
between ideas and senses, this mental phenomenon 
underlying synesthesia is known as ideasthesia. Synesthesia only occurs in some people, although it may be more common
than previously thought. But ideasthesia itself is a 
fundamental part of our lives. Virtually all of us recognize the color
red as warm and blue as cold. Many would agree that bright colors,
italic letters and thin lines are high-pitched, while earth tones are low-pitched. And while many of these associations
are acquired through cultural exposure, others have been demonstrated even
in infants and apes, suggesting that at least 
some associations are inborn. When asked to choose between two
possible names for these shapes, people from entirely different cultural
and language backgrounds overwhelmingly agree that "kiki"
is the spiky star, while "bouba" is the rounded blob, both because of the sounds themselves
and the shapes our mouths make to produce them. And this leads to even more
associations within a rich semantic network. Kiki is described as nervous and clever, while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow. What all of this suggests is that our
everyday experiences of colors, sounds and other stimuli
do not live on separate sensory islands but are organized in a 
network of associations similar to our language network. This is what enables us to 
understand metaphors even though they make no logical sense, such as the comparison of snow
to a white blanket, based on the shared sensations of
softness and lightness. Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art, which relies on a synthesis of
the conceptual and the emotional. In great art, idea and aesthesia
enhance each other, whether it's song lyrics combining
perfectly with a melody, the thematic content of a painting heightened by its use of
colors and brushstrokes, or the well constructed plot of a novel conveyed through perfectly 
crafted sentences. Most importantly, the network of
associations formed by ideasethesia may not only be similar to 
our linguistic network but may, in fact, be an integral part of it. Rather than the traditional view, where our senses first capture 
a collection of colors and shapes, or some vibrations in the air, and our mind then classifies them as a
tree or a siren, ideasthesia suggests that the two
processes occur simultaneously. Our sensory perceptions are shaped by
our conceptual understanding of the world. and the two are so connected that one
cannot exist without the other. If this model suggested 
by ideasthesia is accurate, it may have major implications
for some of the biggest scientific and philosophical issues
surrounding the study of mind. Without a preexisting concept of self, Descartes would not have had an "I"
to attribute the thinking to. And without a preexisting network of
interrelated and distinct concepts, our sensory experience of the world
would be an undifferentiated mass rather than the discrete objects
we actually apprehend. For science, the task is to find where
this network lies, how it is formed, and
how it interacts with external stimuli. For philosophy, 
the challenge is to rethink what this new model of consciousness means
for our understanding of our selves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
Long before Descartes famously declared,
"I think, therefore I am," and long after that, scientists and philosophers alike have puzzled over what they call
the mind-body problem. Is the mind some separate, non-material
entity piloting a machine of flesh? Or if it's just a particularly elusive part
of our physical body, how can it translate the input of our
animal senses into the seemingly non-physical
experiences that we call thoughts? But though the answers have been
debated endlessly, new research suggests that
part of the problem lies in how we pose the question 
in the first place, assuming a distinction between our
sensory perception and our ideas that may not really be there. The traditional model of our mental
function has been that the senses provide
separate data to our brain which are then translated into the 
appropriate mental phenomena: visual images into trees, auditory
experiences into bird songs, and so on. But occasionally, 
we have come across people whose senses seem to mingle together,
allowing them to hear colors, or taste sounds. Until recently, the common understanding
was that this phenomenon, called synesthesia, was a direct connection between the
parts of the brain responsible for sensory stimuli such as seeing the color yellow immediately
upon hearing the tone of b flat. But newer studies have 
shown that synesthesia is actually mediated through our 
understanding of the shapes, colors and sounds
that our senses apprehend. In order for the cross-sensory
experiences to occur, the higher level ideas and concepts
that our minds associate with the sensory input must be activated. For example, this shape can be seen as
either the letter "s" or the number "5," and synesthetes associate each with 
different colors or sounds based on how they interpret it despite the purely visual stimulus 
remaining identical. In another study, synesthetes created
novel color associations for unfamiliar letters after learning
what the letters were. So because it relies on a connection
between ideas and senses, this mental phenomenon 
underlying synesthesia is known as ideasthesia. Synesthesia only occurs in some people, although it may be more common
than previously thought. But ideasthesia itself is a 
fundamental part of our lives. Virtually all of us recognize the color
red as warm and blue as cold. Many would agree that bright colors,
italic letters and thin lines are high-pitched, while earth tones are low-pitched. And while many of these associations
are acquired through cultural exposure, others have been demonstrated even
in infants and apes, suggesting that at least 
some associations are inborn. When asked to choose between two
possible names for these shapes, people from entirely different cultural
and language backgrounds overwhelmingly agree that "kiki"
is the spiky star, while "bouba" is the rounded blob, both because of the sounds themselves
and the shapes our mouths make to produce them. And this leads to even more
associations within a rich semantic network. Kiki is described as nervous and clever, while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow. What all of this suggests is that our
everyday experiences of colors, sounds and other stimuli
do not live on separate sensory islands but are organized in a 
network of associations similar to our language network. This is what enables us to 
understand metaphors even though they make no logical sense, such as the comparison of snow
to a white blanket, based on the shared sensations of
softness and lightness. Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art, which relies on a synthesis of
the conceptual and the emotional. In great art, idea and aesthesia
enhance each other, whether it's song lyrics combining
perfectly with a melody, the thematic content of a painting heightened by its use of
colors and brushstrokes, or the well constructed plot of a novel conveyed through perfectly 
crafted sentences. Most importantly, the network of
associations formed by ideasethesia may not only be similar to 
our linguistic network but may, in fact, be an integral part of it. Rather than the traditional view, where our senses first capture 
a collection of colors and shapes, or some vibrations in the air, and our mind then classifies them as a
tree or a siren, ideasthesia suggests that the two
processes occur simultaneously. Our sensory perceptions are shaped by
our conceptual understanding of the world. and the two are so connected that one
cannot exist without the other. If this model suggested 
by ideasthesia is accurate, it may have major implications
for some of the biggest scientific and philosophical issues
surrounding the study of mind. Without a preexisting concept of self, Descartes would not have had an "I"
to attribute the thinking to. And without a preexisting network of
interrelated and distinct concepts, our sensory experience of the world
would be an undifferentiated mass rather than the discrete objects
we actually apprehend. For science, the task is to find where
this network lies, how it is formed, and
how it interacts with external stimuli. For philosophy, 
the challenge is to rethink what this new model of consciousness means
for our understanding of our selves and our relation to the world around us.

**Transcript**:
Humans have observed comets 
for thousands of years as their orbits have brought them within
visible distance of Earth. Appearing throughout historical records, these mysterious lights that 
came out of nowhere and disappeared after a short while were thought to be ill omens of
war and famine, or the wrath of gods. But recent research has revealed that
comets may be even more deeply connected to humanity and our presence on Earth than any of these mythical 
explanations suggested. When you think of our Solar System,
you probably imagine the nine, sorry eight, planets orbiting the Sun. But beyond Neptune,
far from the heat of the Sun, there is a sparse ring found 
formed by icy chunks ranging from the size 
of marbles to that of small planets. And thousands of times farther at the
outer reaches of the Solar System lies a spherical cloud of small 
fragments and gases. Many of these ancient clumps of stardust
are leftovers from the formation of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, while some of the most distant may even
come from a neighboring system. But sometimes the gravity from 
passing planets or stars pulls them toward our sun, beginning a journey that can take up to
millions of years. As the frozen object travels further
into the Solar System, the sun grows from a distant spark
to an inferno, melting the ice for the first time
in billions of years. Gas and steam eject dust into space, forming a bright surrounding cloud,
called a coma, that can grow even larger than
the sun itself. Meanwhile, the intense stream of 
high-energy particles constantly emitted by the Sun,
known as the solar wind, blows particles away from 
the comet's core, forming a trail of debris up to millions
of miles long. The ice, gas and dust reflect 
light glowing brightly. A comet is born, now orbiting the sun
along with the rest of the objects in our Solar System. But as the comet travels through
the Solar System, the solar wind tears apart and recombines
molecules into various compounds. In some of the compounds that
scientists found, first in the rubble left by a meteorite
that disintegrated above northern Canada, and then in samples collected by a space
craft from a passing comet's tail, were nothing less important than
amino acids. Coming together to form proteins
according to the instructs encoded in DNA, these are the main active components
in all living cells, from bacteria to blue whales. If comets are where these building blocks
of life were first formed, then they are the ultimate source of
life on Earth, and, perhaps, some of the other places
they visited as well. We know that planets orbit nearly every
star in the night sky, with one in five having a planet
similar to Earth in size and temperature. If Earth-like planets and the molecules
found in DNA are not anomalies, we may be only one 
example of what's possible when a planet under the right conditions
is seeded with organic molecules by a passing comet. So, rather than an omen of death, the comet that first brought 
amino acids to Earth could have been a portent of life, a prediction of a distant future,
where creatures of stardust would return to space to find 
the mysteries of where they came from.

**Transcript**:
Humans have observed comets 
for thousands of years as their orbits have brought them within
visible distance of Earth. Appearing throughout historical records, these mysterious lights that 
came out of nowhere and disappeared after a short while were thought to be ill omens of
war and famine, or the wrath of gods. But recent research has revealed that
comets may be even more deeply connected to humanity and our presence on Earth than any of these mythical 
explanations suggested. When you think of our Solar System,
you probably imagine the nine, sorry eight, planets orbiting the Sun. But beyond Neptune,
far from the heat of the Sun, there is a sparse ring found 
formed by icy chunks ranging from the size 
of marbles to that of small planets. And thousands of times farther at the
outer reaches of the Solar System lies a spherical cloud of small 
fragments and gases. Many of these ancient clumps of stardust
are leftovers from the formation of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, while some of the most distant may even
come from a neighboring system. But sometimes the gravity from 
passing planets or stars pulls them toward our sun, beginning a journey that can take up to
millions of years. As the frozen object travels further
into the Solar System, the sun grows from a distant spark
to an inferno, melting the ice for the first time
in billions of years. Gas and steam eject dust into space, forming a bright surrounding cloud,
called a coma, that can grow even larger than
the sun itself. Meanwhile, the intense stream of 
high-energy particles constantly emitted by the Sun,
known as the solar wind, blows particles away from 
the comet's core, forming a trail of debris up to millions
of miles long. The ice, gas and dust reflect 
light glowing brightly. A comet is born, now orbiting the sun
along with the rest of the objects in our Solar System. But as the comet travels through
the Solar System, the solar wind tears apart and recombines
molecules into various compounds. In some of the compounds that
scientists found, first in the rubble left by a meteorite
that disintegrated above northern Canada, and then in samples collected by a space
craft from a passing comet's tail, were nothing less important than
amino acids. Coming together to form proteins
according to the instructs encoded in DNA, these are the main active components
in all living cells, from bacteria to blue whales. If comets are where these building blocks
of life were first formed, then they are the ultimate source of
life on Earth, and, perhaps, some of the other places
they visited as well. We know that planets orbit nearly every
star in the night sky, with one in five having a planet
similar to Earth in size and temperature. If Earth-like planets and the molecules
found in DNA are not anomalies, we may be only one 
example of what's possible when a planet under the right conditions
is seeded with organic molecules by a passing comet. So, rather than an omen of death, the comet that first brought 
amino acids to Earth could have been a portent of life, a prediction of a distant future,
where creatures of stardust would return to space to find 
the mysteries of where they came from.

**Transcript**:
For most of us, two degrees Celsius
is a tiny difference in temperature, not even enough to make 
you crack a window. But scientists have warned that as
CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise, an increase in the Earth's temperature
by even this amount can lead to catastrophic effects
all over the world. How can such a small measurable 
change in one factor lead to massive and unpredictable 
changes in other factors? The answer lies in the concept of a 
mathematical tipping point, which we can understand through the
familiar game of billiards. The basic rule of billiard motion is that a ball will go straight 
until it hits a wall, then bounce off at an angle equal
to its incoming angle. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that
there is no friction, so balls can keep moving indefinitely. And to simplify the situation further, let's look at what happens with only 
one ball on a perfectly circular table. As the ball is struck and begins to move
according to the rules, it follows a neat star-shaped pattern. If we start the ball at
different locations, or strike it at different angles, 
some details of the pattern change, but its overall form remains the same. With a few test runs, and some basic
mathematical modeling, we can even predict a ball's path
before it starts moving, simply based on its starting conditions. But what would happen 
if we made a minor change in the table's shape 
by pulling it apart a bit, and inserting two small straight edges 
along the top and bottom? We can see that as the ball bounces 
off the flat sides, it begins to move all over the table. The ball is still obeying the same rules
of billiard motion, but the resulting movement no longer
follows any recognizable pattern. With only a small change
to the constraints under which the system operates, we have shifted the billiard motion from behaving in a stable
and predictable fashion, to fluctuating wildly, thus creating what mathematicians
call chaotic motion. Inserting the straight edges into
the table acts as a tipping point, switching the systems behavior
from one type of behavior (regular), to another type of behavior (chaotic). So what implications does this simple
example have for the much more complicated reality of the Earth's climate? We can think of the shape of the table as 
being analogous to the CO2 level and Earth's average temperature: Constraints that impact the 
system's performance in the form of the ball's motion 
or the climate's behavior. During the past 10,000 years, the fairly constant CO2 atmospheric 
concentration of 270 parts per million kept the climate
within a self-stabilizing pattern, fairly regular and hospitable 
to human life. But with CO2 levels now at 400
parts per million, and predicted to rise to between
500 and 800 parts per million over the coming century,
we may reach a tipping point where even a small additional change 
in the global average temperature would have the same effect as
changing the shape of the table, leading to a dangerous shift in the
climate's behavior, with more extreme and intense 
weather events, less predictability, and most importantly,
less hospitably to human life. The hypothetical models that 
mathematicians study in detail may not always look like 
actual situations, but they can provide a framework
and a way of thinking that can be applied to help understand the
more complex problems of the real world. In this case, understanding 
how slight changes in the constraints impacting a system
can have massive impacts gives us a greater appreciation for
predicting the dangers that we cannot immediately percieve 
with our own senses. Because once the results do become visible,
it may already be too late.

**Transcript**:
For most of us, two degrees Celsius
is a tiny difference in temperature, not even enough to make 
you crack a window. But scientists have warned that as
CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise, an increase in the Earth's temperature
by even this amount can lead to catastrophic effects
all over the world. How can such a small measurable 
change in one factor lead to massive and unpredictable 
changes in other factors? The answer lies in the concept of a 
mathematical tipping point, which we can understand through the
familiar game of billiards. The basic rule of billiard motion is that a ball will go straight 
until it hits a wall, then bounce off at an angle equal
to its incoming angle. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that
there is no friction, so balls can keep moving indefinitely. And to simplify the situation further, let's look at what happens with only 
one ball on a perfectly circular table. As the ball is struck and begins to move
according to the rules, it follows a neat star-shaped pattern. If we start the ball at
different locations, or strike it at different angles, 
some details of the pattern change, but its overall form remains the same. With a few test runs, and some basic
mathematical modeling, we can even predict a ball's path
before it starts moving, simply based on its starting conditions. But what would happen 
if we made a minor change in the table's shape 
by pulling it apart a bit, and inserting two small straight edges 
along the top and bottom? We can see that as the ball bounces 
off the flat sides, it begins to move all over the table. The ball is still obeying the same rules
of billiard motion, but the resulting movement no longer
follows any recognizable pattern. With only a small change
to the constraints under which the system operates, we have shifted the billiard motion from behaving in a stable
and predictable fashion, to fluctuating wildly, thus creating what mathematicians
call chaotic motion. Inserting the straight edges into
the table acts as a tipping point, switching the systems behavior
from one type of behavior (regular), to another type of behavior (chaotic). So what implications does this simple
example have for the much more complicated reality of the Earth's climate? We can think of the shape of the table as 
being analogous to the CO2 level and Earth's average temperature: Constraints that impact the 
system's performance in the form of the ball's motion 
or the climate's behavior. During the past 10,000 years, the fairly constant CO2 atmospheric 
concentration of 270 parts per million kept the climate
within a self-stabilizing pattern, fairly regular and hospitable 
to human life. But with CO2 levels now at 400
parts per million, and predicted to rise to between
500 and 800 parts per million over the coming century,
we may reach a tipping point where even a small additional change 
in the global average temperature would have the same effect as
changing the shape of the table, leading to a dangerous shift in the
climate's behavior, with more extreme and intense 
weather events, less predictability, and most importantly,
less hospitably to human life. The hypothetical models that 
mathematicians study in detail may not always look like 
actual situations, but they can provide a framework
and a way of thinking that can be applied to help understand the
more complex problems of the real world. In this case, understanding 
how slight changes in the constraints impacting a system
can have massive impacts gives us a greater appreciation for
predicting the dangers that we cannot immediately percieve 
with our own senses. Because once the results do become visible,
it may already be too late.

**Transcript**:
The sun is shining. The birds are singing. It looks like the start
of another lovely day. You're walking happily
in the park, when, "Ah-choo!" A passing stranger has expelled mucus
and saliva from their mouth and nose. You can feel the droplets
of moisture land on your skin, but what you can't feel are
the thousands, or even millions, of microscopic germs that have covertly
traveled through the air and onto your clothing, hands and face. As gross as this scenario sounds, it's actually very common for our bodies
to be exposed to disease-causing germs, and most of the time,
it's not nearly as obvious. Germs are found on almost every surface
we come into contact with. When we talk about germs, we're actually referring to many different
kinds of microscopic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. But what our germs all have in common
is the ability to interact with our bodies and change how we feel and function. Scientists who study infectious diseases
have wondered for decades why it is that some of these germs
are relatively harmless, while others cause devastating effects
and can sometimes be fatal. We still haven't solved the entire puzzle, but what we do know
is that the harmfulness, or virulence, of a germ is a result of evolution. How can it be that the same
evolutionary process can produce germs that cause
very different levels of harm? The answer starts to become clear if we think about a germ's
mode of transmission, which is the strategy it uses
to get from one host to the next. A common mode of transmission
occurs through the air, like the sneeze you just witnessed, and one germ that uses
this method is the rhinovirus, which replicates in our upper airways, and is responsible
for up to half of all common colds. Now, imagine that after the sneeze, one of three hypothetical
varieties of rhinovirus, let's call them "too much,"
"too little," and "just right," has been lucky enough to land on you. These viruses are hardwired to replicate, but because of genetic differences,
they will do so at different rates. "Too much" multiplies very often, making it very successful
in the short run. However, this success comes
at a cost to you, the host. A quickly replicating virus
can cause more damage to your body, making cold symptoms more severe. If you're too sick to leave your home, you don't give the virus any opportunities
to jump to a new host. And if the disease should kill you, the virus' own life cycle will end
along with yours. "Too little," on the other hand,
multiplies rarely and causes you little harm in the process. Although this leaves you healthy enough
to interact with other potential hosts, the lack of symptoms means
you may not sneeze at all, or if you do, there may be too few viruses
in your mucus to infect anyone else. Meanwhile, "just right" has been
replicating quickly enough to ensure that you're carrying
sufficient amounts of the virus to spread but not so often that you're too sick
to get out of bed. And in the end, it's the one
that will be most successful at transmitting itself to new hosts
and giving rise to the next generation. This describes what scientists call
trade-off hypothesis. First developed in the early 1980s, it predicts that germs will evolve
to maximize their overall success by achieving a balance between
replicating within a host, which causes virulence,
and transmission to a new host. In the case of the rhinovirus, the hypothesis predicts that its evolution
will favor less virulent forms because it relies on close contact
to get to its next victim. For the rhinovirus,
a mobile host is a good host, and indeed, that is what we see. While most people experience
a runny nose, coughing and sneezing, the common cold is generally mild
and only lasts about a week. It would be great
if the story ended there, but germs use many other modes
of transmission. For example, the malaria parasite,
plasmodium, is transmitted by mosquitoes. Unlike the rhinovirus, it doesn't need us
to be up and about, and may even benefit from harming us since a sick and immobile person
is easier for mosquitoes to bite. We would expect germs
that depend less on host mobility, like those transmitted
by insects, water or food, to cause more severe symptoms. So, what can we do to reduce
the harmfulness of infectious diseases? Evolutionary biologist Dr. Paul Ewald has suggested that we can
actually direct their evolution through simple disease-control methods. By mosquito-proofing houses,
establishing clean water systems, or staying home when we get a cold, we can obstruct the transmission
strategies of harmful germs while creating a greater dependence
on host mobility. So, while traditional methods
of trying to eradicate germs may only breed stronger ones
in the long run, this innovative approach of encouraging
them to evolve milder forms could be a win-win situation. (Cough) Well, for the most part.

to jump to a new host. And if the disease should kill you, the virus' own life cycle will end
along with yours. "Too little," on the other hand,
multiplies rarely and causes you little harm in the process. Although this leaves you healthy enough
to interact with other potential hosts, the lack of symptoms means
you may not sneeze at all, or if you do, there may be too few viruses
in your mucus to infect anyone else. Meanwhile, "just right" has been
replicating quickly enough to ensure that you're carrying
sufficient amounts of the virus to spread but not so often that you're too sick
to get out of bed. And in the end, it's the one
that will be most successful at transmitting itself to new hosts
and giving rise to the next generation. This describes what scientists call
trade-off hypothesis. First developed in the early 1980s, it predicts that germs will evolve
to maximize their overall success by achieving a balance between
replicating within a host, which causes virulence,
and transmission to a new host. In the case of the rhinovirus, the hypothesis predicts that its evolution
will favor less virulent forms because it relies on close contact
to get to its next victim. For the rhinovirus,
a mobile host is a good host, and indeed, that is what we see. While most people experience
a runny nose, coughing and sneezing, the common cold is generally mild
and only lasts about a week. It would be great
if the story ended there, but germs use many other modes
of transmission. For example, the malaria parasite,
plasmodium, is transmitted by mosquitoes. Unlike the rhinovirus, it doesn't need us
to be up and about, and may even benefit from harming us since a sick and immobile person
is easier for mosquitoes to bite. We would expect germs
that depend less on host mobility, like those transmitted
by insects, water or food, to cause more severe symptoms. So, what can we do to reduce
the harmfulness of infectious diseases? Evolutionary biologist Dr. Paul Ewald has suggested that we can
actually direct their evolution through simple disease-control methods. By mosquito-proofing houses,
establishing clean water systems, or staying home when we get a cold, we can obstruct the transmission
strategies of harmful germs while creating a greater dependence
on host mobility. So, while traditional methods
of trying to eradicate germs may only breed stronger ones
in the long run, this innovative approach of encouraging
them to evolve milder forms could be a win-win situation. (Cough) Well, for the most part.

**Transcript**:
The sun is shining. The birds are singing. It looks like the start
of another lovely day. You're walking happily
in the park, when, "Ah-choo!" A passing stranger has expelled mucus
and saliva from their mouth and nose. You can feel the droplets
of moisture land on your skin, but what you can't feel are
the thousands, or even millions, of microscopic germs that have covertly
traveled through the air and onto your clothing, hands and face. As gross as this scenario sounds, it's actually very common for our bodies
to be exposed to disease-causing germs, and most of the time,
it's not nearly as obvious. Germs are found on almost every surface
we come into contact with. When we talk about germs, we're actually referring to many different
kinds of microscopic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. But what our germs all have in common
is the ability to interact with our bodies and change how we feel and function. Scientists who study infectious diseases
have wondered for decades why it is that some of these germs
are relatively harmless, while others cause devastating effects
and can sometimes be fatal. We still haven't solved the entire puzzle, but what we do know
is that the harmfulness, or virulence, of a germ is a result of evolution. How can it be that the same
evolutionary process can produce germs that cause
very different levels of harm? The answer starts to become clear if we think about a germ's
mode of transmission, which is the strategy it uses
to get from one host to the next. A common mode of transmission
occurs through the air, like the sneeze you just witnessed, and one germ that uses
this method is the rhinovirus, which replicates in our upper airways, and is responsible
for up to half of all common colds. Now, imagine that after the sneeze, one of three hypothetical
varieties of rhinovirus, let's call them "too much,"
"too little," and "just right," has been lucky enough to land on you. These viruses are hardwired to replicate, but because of genetic differences,
they will do so at different rates. "Too much" multiplies very often, making it very successful
in the short run. However, this success comes
at a cost to you, the host. A quickly replicating virus
can cause more damage to your body, making cold symptoms more severe. If you're too sick to leave your home, you don't give the virus any opportunities
to jump to a new host. And if the disease should kill you, the virus' own life cycle will end
along with yours. "Too little," on the other hand,
multiplies rarely and causes you little harm in the process. Although this leaves you healthy enough

in your mucus to infect anyone else. Meanwhile, "just right" has been

sufficient amounts of the virus to spread but not so often that you're too sick
to get out of bed. And in the end, it's the one

**Transcript**:
Albert Einstein played a key role
in launching quantum mechanics through his theory of the
photoelectric effect but remained deeply bothered
by its philosophical implications. And though most of us still remember
him for deriving E=MC^2, his last great contribution to physics
was actually a 1935 paper, coauthored with his young colleagues
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. Regarded as an odd philosophical
footnote well into the 1980s, this EPR paper has recently become central
to a new understanding of quantum physics, with its description 
of a strange phenomenon now known as entangled states. The paper begins by considering a
source that spits out pairs of particles, each with two measurable properties. Each of these measurements has
two possible results of equal probability. Let's say zero or one
for the first property, and A or B for the second. Once a measurement is performed, subsequent measurements of the same
property in the same particle will yield the same result. The strange implication of this scenario is not only that the state 
of a single particle is indeterminate until it's measured, but that the measurement then
determines the state. What's more, the measurements 
affect each other. If you measure a particle 
as being in state 1, and follow it up with the second
type of measurement, you'll have a 50% chance of
getting either A or B, but if you then repeat 
the first measurement, you'll have a a 50% chance of getting zero even though the particle had already
been measured at one. So switching the property being measured
scrambles the original result, allowing for a new, random value. Things get even stranger
when you look at both particles. Each of the particles will produce
random results, but if you compare the two, you will find that they are
always perfectly correlated. For example, if both particles
are measured at zero, the relationship will always hold. The states of the two are entangled. Measuring one will tell you the other
with absolute certainty. But this entanglement seems to defy
Einstein's famous theory of relativity because there is nothing to limit the
distance between particles. If you measure one in New York at noon, and the other in San Francisco 
a nanosecond later, they still give exactly the same result. But if the measurement 
does determine the value, then this would require one particle
sending some sort of signal to the other at 13,000,000 times the speed of light, which according to relativity,
is impossible. For this reason, Einstein dismissed
entanglement as "spuckafte ferwirklung," or spooky action at a distance. He decided that quantum mechanics
must be incomplete, a mere approximation of a deeper reality
in which both particles have predetermined states that 
are hidden from us. Supporters of orthodox quantum theory
lead by Niels Bohr maintained that quantum states
really are fundamentally indeterminate, and entanglement allows 
the state of one particle to depend on that of its distant partner. For 30 years, physics remained 
at an impasse, until John Bell figured out that the key
to testing the EPR argument was to look at cases involving different
measurements on the two particles. The local hidden variable theories
favored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, strictly limited how often you could
get results like 1A or B0 because the outcomes would have to be
defined in advance. Bell showed that the purely 
quantum approach, where the state is truly 
indeterminate until measured, has different limits
and predicts mixed measurement results that are impossible in the
predetermined scenario. Once Bell had worked out how to test
the EPR argument, physicists went out and did it. Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s
and Alain Aspect in the early 80s, dozens of experiments have tested 
the EPR prediction, and all have found the same thing: quantum mechanics is correct. The correlations between the indeterminate
states of entangled particles are real and cannot be explained
by any deeper variable. The EPR paper turned out to be wrong
but brilliantly so. By leading physicists to think deeply
about the foundations of quantum physics, it led to further elaboration 
of the theory and helped launch research into subjects
like quantum information, now a thriving field with the potential to
develop computers of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the randomness
of the measured results prevents science fiction scenarios, like using entangled particles
to send messages faster than light. So relativity is safe, for now. But the quantum universe is far stranger
than Einstein wanted to believe.

entanglement as "spuckafte ferwirklung," or spooky action at a distance. He decided that quantum mechanics
must be incomplete, a mere approximation of a deeper reality
in which both particles have predetermined states that 
are hidden from us. Supporters of orthodox quantum theory
lead by Niels Bohr maintained that quantum states
really are fundamentally indeterminate, and entanglement allows 
the state of one particle to depend on that of its distant partner. For 30 years, physics remained 
at an impasse, until John Bell figured out that the key
to testing the EPR argument was to look at cases involving different
measurements on the two particles. The local hidden variable theories
favored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, strictly limited how often you could
get results like 1A or B0 because the outcomes would have to be
defined in advance. Bell showed that the purely 
quantum approach, where the state is truly 
indeterminate until measured, has different limits
and predicts mixed measurement results that are impossible in the
predetermined scenario. Once Bell had worked out how to test
the EPR argument, physicists went out and did it. Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s
and Alain Aspect in the early 80s, dozens of experiments have tested 
the EPR prediction, and all have found the same thing: quantum mechanics is correct. The correlations between the indeterminate
states of entangled particles are real and cannot be explained
by any deeper variable. The EPR paper turned out to be wrong
but brilliantly so. By leading physicists to think deeply
about the foundations of quantum physics, it led to further elaboration 
of the theory and helped launch research into subjects
like quantum information, now a thriving field with the potential to
develop computers of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the randomness
of the measured results prevents science fiction scenarios, like using entangled particles
to send messages faster than light. So relativity is safe, for now. But the quantum universe is far stranger
than Einstein wanted to believe.

**Transcript**:
Albert Einstein played a key role
in launching quantum mechanics through his theory of the
photoelectric effect but remained deeply bothered
by its philosophical implications. And though most of us still remember
him for deriving E=MC^2, his last great contribution to physics
was actually a 1935 paper, coauthored with his young colleagues
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. Regarded as an odd philosophical
footnote well into the 1980s, this EPR paper has recently become central
to a new understanding of quantum physics, with its description 
of a strange phenomenon now known as entangled states. The paper begins by considering a
source that spits out pairs of particles, each with two measurable properties. Each of these measurements has
two possible results of equal probability. Let's say zero or one
for the first property, and A or B for the second. Once a measurement is performed, subsequent measurements of the same
property in the same particle will yield the same result. The strange implication of this scenario is not only that the state 
of a single particle is indeterminate until it's measured, but that the measurement then
determines the state. What's more, the measurements 
affect each other. If you measure a particle 
as being in state 1, and follow it up with the second
type of measurement, you'll have a 50% chance of
getting either A or B, but if you then repeat 
the first measurement, you'll have a a 50% chance of getting zero even though the particle had already
been measured at one. So switching the property being measured
scrambles the original result, allowing for a new, random value. Things get even stranger
when you look at both particles. Each of the particles will produce
random results, but if you compare the two, you will find that they are
always perfectly correlated. For example, if both particles
are measured at zero, the relationship will always hold. The states of the two are entangled. Measuring one will tell you the other
with absolute certainty. But this entanglement seems to defy
Einstein's famous theory of relativity because there is nothing to limit the
distance between particles. If you measure one in New York at noon, and the other in San Francisco 
a nanosecond later, they still give exactly the same result. But if the measurement 
does determine the value, then this would require one particle
sending some sort of signal to the other at 13,000,000 times the speed of light, which according to relativity,
is impossible. For this reason, Einstein dismissed
entanglement as "spuckafte ferwirklung," or spooky action at a distance. He decided that quantum mechanics

**Transcript**:
Austrian physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger is
one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he's most famous for something he
never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat. He imagined taking a cat and
placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?" Common sense suggests that the cat
is either alive or dead, but Schr√∂dinger pointed out that according
to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is 
a blur of probability, half one thing and half the other. This seems absurd, 
which was Schr√∂dinger's point. He found quantum physics so 
philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make and turned to writing about biology. As absurd as it may seem, though,
Schr√∂dinger's cat is very real. In fact, it's essential. If it weren't possible for quantum objects
to be in two states at once, the computer you're using to watch this
couldn't exist. The quantum phenomenon of 
superposition is a consequence of the dual
particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have
a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions
at the same time. The wavelength of an object limited
to a small region of space can't be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths
at the same time. We don't see these wave properties
for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases
as the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy. If we took a single atom and blew
it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System. That's far too small to detect, so we'll
never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence
of its dual nature. If we shoot electrons one at a time at a
set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected
at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But if you repeat this 
experiment many times, keeping track of all the 
individual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons separated by regions
where there are none at all. Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology. An electron near the nucleus of an atom
exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit. Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to 
choose just one atom but are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form. An electron in a molecule isn't on
just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms,
the electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms
at the same time. The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them,
extending over a large range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move
through the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator
or a semiconductor. Understanding how electrons are shared
among atoms allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors
in the right way allows us to make transistors 
on a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using to
watch this video. An old joke says that the Internet 
exists to allow the sharing of cat videos. At a very deep level, though,
the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist
and his imaginary cat.

**Transcript**:
Austrian physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger is
one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he's most famous for something he
never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat. He imagined taking a cat and
placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?" Common sense suggests that the cat
is either alive or dead, but Schr√∂dinger pointed out that according
to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is 
a blur of probability, half one thing and half the other. This seems absurd, 
which was Schr√∂dinger's point. He found quantum physics so 
philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make and turned to writing about biology. As absurd as it may seem, though,
Schr√∂dinger's cat is very real. In fact, it's essential. If it weren't possible for quantum objects
to be in two states at once, the computer you're using to watch this
couldn't exist. The quantum phenomenon of 
superposition is a consequence of the dual
particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have
a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions
at the same time. The wavelength of an object limited
to a small region of space can't be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths
at the same time. We don't see these wave properties
for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases
as the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy. If we took a single atom and blew
it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System. That's far too small to detect, so we'll
never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence
of its dual nature. If we shoot electrons one at a time at a
set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected
at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But if you repeat this 
experiment many times, keeping track of all the 
individual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons separated by regions
where there are none at all. Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology. An electron near the nucleus of an atom
exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit. Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to 
choose just one atom but are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form. An electron in a molecule isn't on
just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms,
the electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms
at the same time. The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them,
extending over a large range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move
through the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator
or a semiconductor. Understanding how electrons are shared
among atoms allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors
in the right way allows us to make transistors 
on a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using to
watch this video. An old joke says that the Internet 
exists to allow the sharing of cat videos. At a very deep level, though,
the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist
and his imaginary cat.

**Transcript**:
Many people in the United States
and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary
of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer
who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought
colonialism and slavery? And did he even discover America at all? It's time to put Columbus on the stand
in History vs. Christopher Columbus. "Order, order in the court. Wait, am I even supposed to 
be at work today?" Cough "Yes, your Honor. From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated
in many parts of the United States on October 12th,
the actual anniversary date. But although it was declared
an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required
to observe it. Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away
from it completely." Cough "What a pity. In the 70s, we even moved it to the
second Monday in October so people could get a nice 
three-day weekend, but I guess you folks
just hate celebrations." "Uh, what are we celebrating again?" "Come on, Your Honor, 
we all learned it in school. Christopher Columbus convinced the King
of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land
but sailing West around the globe. Everyone said it was crazy because they
still thought the world was flat, but he knew better. And when in 1492 he
sailed the ocean blue, he found something better
than India: a whole new continent." "What rubbish. First of all, educated people knew
the world was round since Aristotle. Secondly, Columbus didn't 
discover anything. There were already people living here
for millennia. And he wasn't even 
the first European to visit. The Norse had settled Newfoundland
almost 500 years before." "You don't say, so how come we're not
all wearing those cow helmets?" "Actually, they didn't really 
wear those either." Cough "Who cares what some Vikings did
way back when? Those settlements didn't last,
but Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe
spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers
who came after. Without him, none of us 
would be here today." "And because of him, millions of
Native Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did
in the colonies he founded? He took the very first 
natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily
he could conquer and enslave all of them." "Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each
other back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding
and taking captives?" "Yes, but tribal warfare 
was sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90%
of the population." "Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus
so important to you, anyway?" "Your Honor, Columbus's voyage 
was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe,
symbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents
and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better
lives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind
everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?" "And what about the struggles 
of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out 
and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from
poverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man
who caused so much suffering?" "That's history. You can't judge a guy
in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization 
across the world was a moral duty." "Actually, he was pretty bad,
even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured
and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into 
sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other 
colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed 
from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary, 
Bartolom√© de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508,
over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in 
future generations will believe this?'" "Well, I'm not sure I believe 
those numbers." "Say, aren't there other ways the holiday
is celebrated?" "In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under
different names, such as D√≠a de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration
of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also
renamed the holiday, as Native American Day
or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly." "So, why not just change the name
if it's such a problem?" "Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes
and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating
the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this
serious research? It's not like anyone is actually 
celebrating genocide." "Traditions change, and the way 
we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values." "Well, it looks like giving tired judges a
day off isn't one of those values, anyway." Traditions and holidays 
are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era
may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands
and our values evolve. And deciding what these 
traditions should mean today is a major part 
of putting history on trial.

**Transcript**:
Many people in the United States
and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary
of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer
who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought
colonialism and slavery? And did he even discover America at all? It's time to put Columbus on the stand
in History vs. Christopher Columbus. "Order, order in the court. Wait, am I even supposed to 
be at work today?" Cough "Yes, your Honor. From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated
in many parts of the United States on October 12th,
the actual anniversary date. But although it was declared
an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required
to observe it. Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away
from it completely." Cough "What a pity. In the 70s, we even moved it to the
second Monday in October so people could get a nice 
three-day weekend, but I guess you folks
just hate celebrations." "Uh, what are we celebrating again?" "Come on, Your Honor, 
we all learned it in school. Christopher Columbus convinced the King
of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land
but sailing West around the globe. Everyone said it was crazy because they
still thought the world was flat, but he knew better. And when in 1492 he
sailed the ocean blue, he found something better
than India: a whole new continent." "What rubbish. First of all, educated people knew
the world was round since Aristotle. Secondly, Columbus didn't 
discover anything. There were already people living here
for millennia. And he wasn't even 
the first European to visit. The Norse had settled Newfoundland
almost 500 years before." "You don't say, so how come we're not
all wearing those cow helmets?" "Actually, they didn't really 
wear those either." Cough "Who cares what some Vikings did
way back when? Those settlements didn't last,
but Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe
spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers
who came after. Without him, none of us 
would be here today." "And because of him, millions of
Native Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did
in the colonies he founded? He took the very first 
natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily
he could conquer and enslave all of them." "Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each
other back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding
and taking captives?" "Yes, but tribal warfare 
was sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90%
of the population." "Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus
so important to you, anyway?" "Your Honor, Columbus's voyage 
was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe,
symbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents
and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better
lives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind
everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?" "And what about the struggles 
of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out 
and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from
poverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man
who caused so much suffering?" "That's history. You can't judge a guy
in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization 
across the world was a moral duty." "Actually, he was pretty bad,
even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured
and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into 
sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other 
colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed 
from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary, 
Bartolom√© de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508,
over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in 
future generations will believe this?'" "Well, I'm not sure I believe 
those numbers." "Say, aren't there other ways the holiday
is celebrated?" "In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under
different names, such as D√≠a de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration
of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also
renamed the holiday, as Native American Day
or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly." "So, why not just change the name
if it's such a problem?" "Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes
and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating
the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this
serious research? It's not like anyone is actually 
celebrating genocide." "Traditions change, and the way 
we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values." "Well, it looks like giving tired judges a
day off isn't one of those values, anyway." Traditions and holidays 
are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era
may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands
and our values evolve. And deciding what these 
traditions should mean today is a major part 
of putting history on trial.

in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization 
across the world was a moral duty." "Actually, he was pretty bad,
even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured
and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into 
sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other 
colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed 
from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary, 
Bartolom√© de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508,
over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in 
future generations will believe this?'" "Well, I'm not sure I believe 
those numbers." "Say, aren't there other ways the holiday
is celebrated?" "In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under
different names, such as D√≠a de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration
of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also
renamed the holiday, as Native American Day
or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly." "So, why not just change the name
if it's such a problem?" "Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes
and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating
the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this
serious research? It's not like anyone is actually 
celebrating genocide." "Traditions change, and the way 
we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values." "Well, it looks like giving tired judges a
day off isn't one of those values, anyway." Traditions and holidays 
are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era
may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands
and our values evolve. And deciding what these 
traditions should mean today is a major part 
of putting history on trial.

**Transcript**:
Light is the fastest thing we know. It's so fast that we measure
enormous distances by how long it takes
for light to travel them. In one year, light travels
about 6,000,000,000,000 miles, a distance we call one light year. To give you an idea of just
how far this is, the Moon, which took the Apollo astronauts
four days to reach, is only one light-second from Earth. Meanwhile, the nearest star beyond
our own Sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.24 light years away. Our Milky Way is on the order of
100,000 light years across. The nearest galaxy to our own, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light years away Space is mind-blowingly vast. But wait, how do we know how
far away stars and galaxies are? After all, when we look at the sky,
we have a flat, two-dimensional view. If you point you finger to one star,
you can't tell how far the star is, so how do astrophysicists figure that out? For objects that are very close by, we can use a concept called
trigonometric parallax. The idea is pretty simple. Let's do an experiment. Stick out your thumb and 
close your left eye. Now, open your left eye and
close your right eye. It will look like your thumb has moved, while more distant background objects
have remained in place. The same concept applies when
we look at the stars, but distant stars are much, much 
farther away than the length of your arm, and the Earth isn't very large, so even if you had different telescopes
across the equator, you'd not see much of a shift in position. Instead, we look at the change in the
star's apparent location over six months, the halfway point of the Earth's
yearlong orbit around the Sun. When we measure the relative positions
of the stars in summer, and then again in winter,
it's like looking with your other eye. Nearby stars seem to have moved
against the background of the more distant stars and galaxies. But this method only works for objects no
more than a few thousand light years away. Beyond our own galaxy,
the distances are so great that the parallax is too small to detect
with even our most sensitive instruments. So at this point we have to rely 
on a different method using indicators we call standard candles. Standard candles are objects whose
intrinsic brightness, or luminosity, we know really well. For example, if you know how bright
your light bulb is, and you ask your friend to hold
the light bulb and walk away from you, you know that the amount of light
you receive from your friend will decrease by the distance squared. So by comparing the amount 
of light you receive to the intrinsic brightness 
of the light bulb, you can then tell how far away
your friend is. In astronomy, our light bulb turns out to
be a special type of star called a cepheid variable. These stars are internally unstable, like a constantly inflating 
and deflating balloon. And because the expansion and contraction
causes their brightness to vary, we can calculate their luminosity
by measuring the period of this cycle, with more luminous stars 
changing more slowly. By comparing the light
we observe from these stars to the intrinsic brightness we've
calculated this way, we can tell how far away they are. Unfortunately, this is still not 
the end of the story. We can only observe individual stars
up to about 40,000,000 light years away, after which they become 
too blurry to resolve. But luckily we have another type
of standard candle: the famous type 1a supernova. Supernovae, giant stellar explosions
are one of the ways that stars die. These explosions are so bright, that they outshine the galaxies
where they occur. So even when we can't see 
individual stars in a galaxy, we can still see supernovae 
when they happen. And type 1a supernovae turn out
to be usable as standard candles because intrinsically bright ones
fade slower than fainter ones. Through our understanding 
of this relationship between brightness and decline rate, we can use these supernovae 
to probe distances up to several billions of light years away. But why is it important to see
such distant objects anyway? Well, remember how fast light travels. For example, the light emitted by the Sun
will take eight minutes to reach us, which means that the light we see now
is a picture of the Sun eight minutes ago. When you look at the Big Dipper, you're seeing what it looked like
80 years ago. And those smudgy galaxies? They're millions of light years away. It has taken millions of years for
that light to reach us. So the universe itself is in some sense
an inbuilt time machine. The further we can look back,
the younger the universe we are probing. Astrophysicists try to read the history
of the universe, and understand how
and where we come from. The universe is constantly sending us
information in the form of light. All that remains if for us to decode it.

close your left eye. Now, open your left eye and
close your right eye. It will look like your thumb has moved, while more distant background objects
have remained in place. The same concept applies when
we look at the stars, but distant stars are much, much 
farther away than the length of your arm, and the Earth isn't very large, so even if you had different telescopes
across the equator, you'd not see much of a shift in position. Instead, we look at the change in the
star's apparent location over six months, the halfway point of the Earth's
yearlong orbit around the Sun. When we measure the relative positions
of the stars in summer, and then again in winter,
it's like looking with your other eye. Nearby stars seem to have moved
against the background of the more distant stars and galaxies. But this method only works for objects no
more than a few thousand light years away. Beyond our own galaxy,
the distances are so great that the parallax is too small to detect
with even our most sensitive instruments. So at this point we have to rely 
on a different method using indicators we call standard candles. Standard candles are objects whose
intrinsic brightness, or luminosity, we know really well. For example, if you know how bright
your light bulb is, and you ask your friend to hold
the light bulb and walk away from you, you know that the amount of light
you receive from your friend will decrease by the distance squared. So by comparing the amount 
of light you receive to the intrinsic brightness 
of the light bulb, you can then tell how far away
your friend is. In astronomy, our light bulb turns out to
be a special type of star called a cepheid variable. These stars are internally unstable, like a constantly inflating 
and deflating balloon. And because the expansion and contraction
causes their brightness to vary, we can calculate their luminosity
by measuring the period of this cycle, with more luminous stars 
changing more slowly. By comparing the light
we observe from these stars to the intrinsic brightness we've
calculated this way, we can tell how far away they are. Unfortunately, this is still not 
the end of the story. We can only observe individual stars
up to about 40,000,000 light years away, after which they become 
too blurry to resolve. But luckily we have another type
of standard candle: the famous type 1a supernova. Supernovae, giant stellar explosions
are one of the ways that stars die. These explosions are so bright, that they outshine the galaxies
where they occur. So even when we can't see 
individual stars in a galaxy, we can still see supernovae 
when they happen. And type 1a supernovae turn out
to be usable as standard candles because intrinsically bright ones
fade slower than fainter ones. Through our understanding 
of this relationship between brightness and decline rate, we can use these supernovae 
to probe distances up to several billions of light years away. But why is it important to see
such distant objects anyway? Well, remember how fast light travels. For example, the light emitted by the Sun
will take eight minutes to reach us, which means that the light we see now
is a picture of the Sun eight minutes ago. When you look at the Big Dipper, you're seeing what it looked like
80 years ago. And those smudgy galaxies? They're millions of light years away. It has taken millions of years for
that light to reach us. So the universe itself is in some sense
an inbuilt time machine. The further we can look back,
the younger the universe we are probing. Astrophysicists try to read the history
of the universe, and understand how
and where we come from. The universe is constantly sending us
information in the form of light. All that remains if for us to decode it.

**Transcript**:
A, C, E, D, B, K. No, this isn't some random,
out of order alphabet. These are vitamins,
and just like letters build words, they're the building blocks
that keep the body running. Vitamins are organic compounds we need
to ingest in small amounts to keep functioning. They're the body's builders, defenders
and maintenance workers, helping it to build muscle and bone,
make use of nutrients, capture and use energy
and heal wounds. If you need convincing about
vitamin value, just consider the plight of 
olden day sailors, who had no access to vitamin-rich
fresh produce. They got scurvy. But vitamin C,
abundant in fruits and vegetables, was the simple antidote to this disease. While bacteria, fungi and plants
produce their own vitamins, our bodies can't, so we have to get
them from other sources. So how does the body get
vitamins from out there into here? That's dependent on the form
these compounds take. Vitamins come in two types: lipid-soluble and 
water-soluble, and the difference between them 
determines how the body transports and stores vitamins, 
and gets rid of the excess. The water-solubles are vitamin C and B Complex vitamins that are made up of
eight different types that each do something unique. These are dissolved in the watery parts
of fruits, vegetables and grains, meaning their passage through the body
is relatively straightforward. Once inside the system,
these foods are digested and the vitamins within them are
taken up directly by the bloodstream. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have their
transport cut out for them and can move around freely 
within the body. For lipid-soluble vitamins,
dissolved in fat and found in foods like diary,
butter and oils, this trip into the blood is a little
more adventurous. These vitamins make it through
the stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance
called bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing it for
absorption through the intestinal wall. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make
use of the blood's watery nature, they need something else 
to move them around, and that comes from proteins that attach
to the vitamins and act like couriers, transporting fat-solubles into the blood
and around the body. So, this difference between water-
or fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood, but also how they're stored 
or rejected from the body. The system's ability to circulate
water-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream so easily means that most of them can be passed
out equally easily via the kidneys. Because of that, 
most water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished on a daily basis
through the food we eat. But fat-soluble vitamins have
staying power because they can be packed into the liver
and in fat cells. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing the vitamins there and rationing
them out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload
on this type of vitamin because the body is generally 
well stocked. Once we figured the logistics
of transport and storage, the vitamins are left to do the work
they came here to do in the first place. Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,
make up coenzymes, whose job it is to help enzymes 
release the energy from food. Other B vitamins then help the body
to use that energy. From vitamin C, you get the ability to
fight infection and make collagen, a kind of tissue that forms 
bones and teeth and heals wounds. Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,
key in the body's defense, helps shape bones and improves vision 
by keeping the cells of the eye in check. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus 
so we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body
that can damage cells. Finally, from Vitamin K, we score
the ability to clot blood, since it helps make the proteins
that do this job. Without this vitamin variety, humans face deficiencies that 
cause a range of problems, like fatigue, nerve damage, 
heart disorders, or diseases like rickets and scurvy. On the other hand, too much of any
vitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading
yourself with supplements is a great idea. In reality, it's all about getting the
balance right, and hitting that vitamin jackpot.

of fruits, vegetables and grains, meaning their passage through the body
is relatively straightforward. Once inside the system,
these foods are digested and the vitamins within them are
taken up directly by the bloodstream. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have their
transport cut out for them and can move around freely 
within the body. For lipid-soluble vitamins,
dissolved in fat and found in foods like diary,
butter and oils, this trip into the blood is a little
more adventurous. These vitamins make it through
the stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance
called bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing it for
absorption through the intestinal wall. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make
use of the blood's watery nature, they need something else 
to move them around, and that comes from proteins that attach
to the vitamins and act like couriers, transporting fat-solubles into the blood
and around the body. So, this difference between water-
or fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood, but also how they're stored 
or rejected from the body. The system's ability to circulate
water-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream so easily means that most of them can be passed
out equally easily via the kidneys. Because of that, 
most water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished on a daily basis
through the food we eat. But fat-soluble vitamins have
staying power because they can be packed into the liver
and in fat cells. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing the vitamins there and rationing
them out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload
on this type of vitamin because the body is generally 
well stocked. Once we figured the logistics
of transport and storage, the vitamins are left to do the work
they came here to do in the first place. Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,
make up coenzymes, whose job it is to help enzymes 
release the energy from food. Other B vitamins then help the body
to use that energy. From vitamin C, you get the ability to
fight infection and make collagen, a kind of tissue that forms 
bones and teeth and heals wounds. Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,
key in the body's defense, helps shape bones and improves vision 
by keeping the cells of the eye in check. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus 
so we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body
that can damage cells. Finally, from Vitamin K, we score
the ability to clot blood, since it helps make the proteins
that do this job. Without this vitamin variety, humans face deficiencies that 
cause a range of problems, like fatigue, nerve damage, 
heart disorders, or diseases like rickets and scurvy. On the other hand, too much of any
vitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading
yourself with supplements is a great idea. In reality, it's all about getting the
balance right, and hitting that vitamin jackpot.

**Transcript**:
Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has 
been vast disagreement over what exactly it is and what,
if anything, to do about it. In its simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction 
to a difficult situation. You feel sad when a friend moves away
or when a pet dies. When a friend says, "I'm sad," you often respond by asking,
"What happened?" But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors didn't
view sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid
inside the body. According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled
by four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced
a person's health and temperament. Melancholia comes from
melaina kole, the word for black bile,
the humor believed to cause sadness. By changing your diet
and through medical practices, you could bring your humors
into balance. Even though we now know
much more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain 
kinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain. Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life
but an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness. In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow." The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To understand the sadness of the trees
losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle
of life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem
pretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on
a more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying
and feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our
ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,
was an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer
to the suffering person, and this helped both the person
and the larger community to thrive. Perhaps sadness helped generate
the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether
the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering
we experience ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne -
Or has an Easier size." And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists,
like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't
universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way
we use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness 
becomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality, and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms. David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his project 
"paradise engineering." But is there something sad about
a world without sadness? Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part 
of such a paradise. In fact, the only things about sadness
that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most
people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal
with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express
what feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -"

of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life
but an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness. In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow." The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To understand the sadness of the trees
losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle
of life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem
pretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on
a more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying
and feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our
ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,
was an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer
to the suffering person, and this helped both the person
and the larger community to thrive. Perhaps sadness helped generate
the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether
the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering
we experience ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne -
Or has an Easier size." And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists,
like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't
universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way
we use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness 
becomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality, and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms. David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his project 
"paradise engineering." But is there something sad about
a world without sadness? Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part 
of such a paradise. In fact, the only things about sadness
that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most
people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal
with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express
what feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -"

**Transcript**:
Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has 
been vast disagreement over what exactly it is and what,
if anything, to do about it. In its simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction 
to a difficult situation. You feel sad when a friend moves away
or when a pet dies. When a friend says, "I'm sad," you often respond by asking,
"What happened?" But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors didn't
view sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid
inside the body. According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled
by four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced
a person's health and temperament. Melancholia comes from
melaina kole, the word for black bile,
the humor believed to cause sadness. By changing your diet
and through medical practices, you could bring your humors
into balance. Even though we now know
much more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain 
kinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain. Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life

**Transcript**:
When the infamous fictional character, Carrie White, left her high school
prom hall ablaze, and brought terror upon her town, she relied on her powers of telekinesis, the ability to manipulate physical
objects using the power of the mind alone. But while Carrie is just a fictional film
based upon a fictional book, belief in telekinesis
isn't fictional at all. For centuries, humans have claimed
they really do have the power to control the motion of objects
using only their minds. Levitation, opening doors at will
and spoon bending are all intriguing examples. It happens in the Matrix when Neo
freezes bullets midair, and it's a skill that 
Yoda has honed to a T. But is telekinesis real, or just as fictional as 
Carrie, Yoda and Neo combined? To investigate, we need to evaluate
telekinetic claims through a scientific lens
using the scientific method. Telekinesis is part of the discipline
called parapsychology, in which researchers study 
psychic phenomena. Parapsychologists regard what they 
do as a science, but other scientists disagree. Let's start with a few basic observations. Observation #1: While there are loads of anecdotes out
there about telekinesis, there's no scientific proof 
that it exists; no studies conducted according to
the scientific method and repeated under lab conditions
can show that its real. In the 1930s, the so-called father
of parapsychology, Joseph Banks Rhine, tested in the lab whether people
could use telekinesis to make a dice roll the way 
they wanted it to. But afterwards, scientists couldn't
replicate his results, and since replication is key
to proving an idea, that was a problem. Aside from scientists, there are also countless
self-proclaimed telekinetics, but all have been exposed as tricksters, or can't perform under conditions
where they're not totally in control, suggesting that they manipulate the
situation to get the results they want. Today, there's even a huge stash of prize
money available from lots of organizations for anyone who can prove that psychic
abilities, like telekinesis, are real. But these riches remain unclaimed. Observation #2: When we investigate telekinesis, there's no consensus about
what exactly is being measured. Are powerful, Yoda-like brainwaves
at work perhaps? Since nobody agrees, it's difficult
to apply a research standard, something required in all 
other types of science to test the validity of ideas. Observation #3: The point of science is to
discover the unknown, and in the history of 
scientific investigation, it's definitely happened that new discoveries have 
gone against established science, and even overturned 
whole branches of science. Such discoveries must be 
proven extra carefully to withstand skepticism. In the case of telekinesis, the idea goes against established science, but lacks the powerful
evidence in favor of it. Our universe is controlled
and explained by the laws of physics, and one of these laws tells us
that brain waves can't control objects because they're neither strong
nor far-reaching enough to influence anything 
outside of our skulls. Physics also tells us that the only forces
that can influence objects from afar are magnetic and gravitational. Probably the closest thing to 
telekinesis that science can explain is the use of thoughts
to control a robotic arm. In the brains of stroke 
patients who can't move, researchers can implant tiny wires
into the region that controls movement, and then train the patient to 
concentrate on moving a robotic arm, which acts like an extension
of their minds, and it works. It's amazing, but it isn't telekinesis. The patients thoughts aren't just vague,
undetectable things. They're measurable brain signals, translated through wires into a robot. Science can measure, test
and explain the motion, and that's how we've shown that 
this kind of mind control is real. Science is a slow process of accumulating the evidence that either stands 
for or against an idea. When we stack up evidence, we can see which tower grows tallest, and in the case of telekinesis,
it's not the tower showing that it exists. Some say this mystical phenomenon
can't fit within the confines of science, and that's okay. But then telekinesis becomes purely
a matter of personal conviction. If something can't be 
assessed scientifically, then it can't be described
as scientific either. So the results of our investigation reveal that however much 
we may want to believe that the force really is within us, the case for telekinesis
remains weak. Sorry Neo, Carrie and Yoda. Your skills are mind-blowing,

**Transcript**:
When the infamous fictional character, Carrie White, left her high school
prom hall ablaze, and brought terror upon her town, she relied on her powers of telekinesis, the ability to manipulate physical
objects using the power of the mind alone. But while Carrie is just a fictional film
based upon a fictional book, belief in telekinesis
isn't fictional at all. For centuries, humans have claimed
they really do have the power to control the motion of objects
using only their minds. Levitation, opening doors at will
and spoon bending are all intriguing examples. It happens in the Matrix when Neo
freezes bullets midair, and it's a skill that 
Yoda has honed to a T. But is telekinesis real, or just as fictional as 
Carrie, Yoda and Neo combined? To investigate, we need to evaluate
telekinetic claims through a scientific lens
using the scientific method. Telekinesis is part of the discipline
called parapsychology, in which researchers study 
psychic phenomena. Parapsychologists regard what they 
do as a science, but other scientists disagree. Let's start with a few basic observations. Observation #1: While there are loads of anecdotes out
there about telekinesis, there's no scientific proof 
that it exists; no studies conducted according to
the scientific method and repeated under lab conditions
can show that its real. In the 1930s, the so-called father
of parapsychology, Joseph Banks Rhine, tested in the lab whether people
could use telekinesis to make a dice roll the way 
they wanted it to. But afterwards, scientists couldn't
replicate his results, and since replication is key
to proving an idea, that was a problem. Aside from scientists, there are also countless
self-proclaimed telekinetics, but all have been exposed as tricksters, or can't perform under conditions
where they're not totally in control, suggesting that they manipulate the
situation to get the results they want. Today, there's even a huge stash of prize
money available from lots of organizations for anyone who can prove that psychic
abilities, like telekinesis, are real. But these riches remain unclaimed. Observation #2: When we investigate telekinesis, there's no consensus about

telekinesis that science can explain is the use of thoughts
to control a robotic arm. In the brains of stroke 
patients who can't move, researchers can implant tiny wires
into the region that controls movement, and then train the patient to 
concentrate on moving a robotic arm, which acts like an extension
of their minds, and it works. It's amazing, but it isn't telekinesis. The patients thoughts aren't just vague,
undetectable things. They're measurable brain signals, translated through wires into a robot. Science can measure, test
and explain the motion, and that's how we've shown that 
this kind of mind control is real. Science is a slow process of accumulating the evidence that either stands 
for or against an idea. When we stack up evidence, we can see which tower grows tallest, and in the case of telekinesis,
it's not the tower showing that it exists. Some say this mystical phenomenon
can't fit within the confines of science, and that's okay. But then telekinesis becomes purely
a matter of personal conviction. If something can't be 
assessed scientifically, then it can't be described
as scientific either. So the results of our investigation reveal that however much 
we may want to believe that the force really is within us, the case for telekinesis
remains weak. Sorry Neo, Carrie and Yoda. Your skills are mind-blowing,
but for now, they belong in the movies.

"Hey, another atom.
I'm hydrogen, nice to meet you. How are you feeling about the jump?" "Hi there, I'm antihydrogen,
your antiatom, and to be honest, I'm feeling
kind of neutral. My positron and antiproton balance out,
just like your electron and proton, right?" "Hey, yeah! You look just like me,
but different somehow." "Whoa, be careful! If we get too close,
we'll disappear in a spark of energy. I'd like to stay in one piece." "Oh wow, sorry." "It's okay. I was just thinking, it's kind of weird for us to be chatting like this before our 
jump above CERN." "Why's that?" "Well, for starters, how do we know
we'll both fall?" "Of course we'll fall. It's gravity, you know, the force of attraction 
between masses. I even know how fast we should fall. Galileo showed in that tower experiment that all falling objects accelerate 
at the same rate, regardless of mass." "That's for bigger objects. It's a different story 
for small particles like us. Our mass is so tiny that the gravitational
force we experience is miniscule, and if the particles are charged, 
like my antiproton or your proton, then it becomes impossible to detect compared to the much greater
electromagnetic force acting on them." "But that's only for charged particles.
You and I are both neutral. Our charges balance out,
so the electromagnetic force is small and the gravitational force
should be detectable. I know mine's been measured." "Because you're everywhere, 
but I'm kind of hard to find." "Why is that, anyway? Shouldn't there have been an equal amount of matter and antimatter created
in the Big Bang?" "You'd think so, but then all of
those particles would have annihilated 
each other into energy, remember? And the Universe is obviously
full of matter. No one knows why there is more matter
than antimatter, which is why scientists
are so interested in studying me." "So where do they find you anyway?" "Actually, I was made in that 
lab down there. They needed an accelerator to make
my antiproton because it's so heavy, just as heavy as your proton. Getting my positron was easier. It's much lighter, like your electron,
and there are materials that naturally decay by emitting one. Then they just had to put the two together
and they got me. But it's only recently that they've been able to keep me around long enough
to study my properties." "And now they've sent you on this
jump with me. Hey, wait a minute." "That's right. We're reenacting
Galileo's experiment, but with matter and antimatter
instead of two objects made of matter." "So what's going to happen? Are you going to fall 
upwards or something?" "Only one way to find out!"

my antiproton because it's so heavy, just as heavy as your proton. Getting my positron was easier. It's much lighter, like your electron,
and there are materials that naturally decay by emitting one. Then they just had to put the two together
and they got me. But it's only recently that they've been able to keep me around long enough
to study my properties." "And now they've sent you on this
jump with me. Hey, wait a minute." "That's right. We're reenacting
Galileo's experiment, but with matter and antimatter
instead of two objects made of matter." "So what's going to happen? Are you going to fall 
upwards or something?" "Only one way to find out!"

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Do the constituents of antihydrogen have the same mass as the constituents of hydrogen?
Options: A. We don't know; we haven't measured it yet, B. No, they have different masses, and that's why we can't expect the universality of free fall to be valid for antimatter, C. Yes, measurements so far have shown that the constituents of antihydrogen have the same mass as the constituents of hydrogen
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why is it challenging to detect the gravitational force acting on small particles like antihydrogen?
Options: A. Because they are too heavy and the gravitational force is too strong, B. Because they are too light and the gravitational force is too weak, C. Because the electromagnetic force acting on them is much greater, D. Because they are neutral and do not interact with the gravitational field
Correct Option: C

2. Evaluate each matched MCQ pair based on the following criteria:

Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end
of the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier
and less productive, but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem. In order to predict how
the temperature will change, scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age 
since 1750 and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century. To do this, we need to know
two things: First, the global temperature rise
since 1750, and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models
that reliably simulate the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds, and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life. So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only
minute amounts, near one molecule per million million
molecules of air. This lack of understanding
is the main reason for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, "Cloud" has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained

Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end
of the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier
and less productive, but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since

**Transcript**:
Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature. Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end
of the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier
and less productive, but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem. In order to predict how
the temperature will change, scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age 
since 1750 and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century. To do this, we need to know
two things: First, the global temperature rise
since 1750, and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models
that reliably simulate the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds, and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life. So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only
minute amounts, near one molecule per million million
molecules of air. This lack of understanding
is the main reason for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, "Cloud" has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence of galactic cosmic rays on clouds? Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.

**Transcript**:
How much can we really know about 
the universe beyond our galaxy? The Hubble Telescope has enabled us to see objects in space as far 
13,000,000,000 light years away. But this still doesn't give us the answers
to all our questions, questions like, "What is the universe
made of?" "Which elements are the most abundant?" "Does space contain undiscovered
forms of matter?" "Could there be antimatter stars
or galaxies?" Some of these questions cannot
be answered solely from visual images, but what if we had messengers
bringing us physical data from distant parts of the cosmos, beyond the reach of 
explorers or satellites? In a way, we do, and these 
"space messengers" are called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays were first discovered
in 1912 by Victor Hess when he set out to explore variations
in the atmosphere's level of radiation, which had been thought to
emanate from the Earth's crust. By taking measurements on board
a flying balloon during an eclipse, Hess demonstrated both that
the radiation actually increased at greater altitudes
and that the sun could not be its source. The startling conclusion was that 
it wasn't coming from anywhere within the Earth's atmosphere
but from outer space. Our universe is composed of many
astronomical objects. BIllions of stars of all sizes, black holes,
active galactic nuclei, astroids, planets and more. During violent disturbances, such as a
large star exploding into a supernova, billions of particles are 
emitted into space. Although they are called rays, cosmic rays consist of these 
high energy particles rather than the photons that
make up light rays. While the light from an explosion
travels in a straight line at its famous constant speed, the particles are trapped
in extraordinary loops by magnetic shockwaves 
generated by the explosion. Crossing back and forth
through these magnetic field lines accelerates them to almost the speed of
light before they escape. There are lots of cosmic rays in space,
and some of these particles have traveled for billions of years before reaching Earth. When they enter our atmosphere,
they collide with the molecules there, generating secondary cosmic rays, lighter particles with less energy
than the original. Most of these are absorbed 
into the atmosphere, but some are able to reach the ground,
even passing through our bodies. At sea level, this radiation is fairly low. But people who spend a lot of time
at higher altitudes, such as airline crews,
are exposed to much more. What makes cosmic rays
useful as messengers is that they carry the traces
of their origins. By studying the frequency
with which different particles occur, scientists are able to determine
the relative abundance of elements, such as hydrogen and helium,
within the universe. But cosmic rays may provide
even more fascinating information about the fabric of the universe itself. An experiment called
the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, A.M.S., has recently been installed on board
the International Space Station, containing several detectors that can
separately measure a cosmic ray particle's velocity,
trajectory, radiation, mass and energy, as well as whether the particle
is matter or antimatter. While the two are normally
indistinguishable, their opposite charges enable them
to be detected with the help of a magnet. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is
currently measuring 50 million particles per day with information about each particle being
sent in real time from the space station to the A.M.S. control room at CERN. Over the upcoming months and years, it's expected to yield both amazing
and useful information about antimatter, the possible existence of dark matter, and even possible ways
to mitigate the effects of cosmic radiation on space travel. As we stay tuned for new discoveries,
look to the sky on a clear night, and you may see the
International Space Station, where the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
receives the tiny messengers that carry cosmic secrets.

How much can we really know about 
the universe beyond our galaxy? The Hubble Telescope has enabled us to see objects in space as far 
13,000,000,000 light years away. But this still doesn't give us the answers
to all our questions, questions like, "What is the universe
made of?" "Which elements are the most abundant?" "Does space contain undiscovered
forms of matter?" "Could there be antimatter stars
or galaxies?" Some of these questions cannot
be answered solely from visual images, but what if we had messengers
bringing us physical data from distant parts of the cosmos, beyond the reach of 
explorers or satellites? In a way, we do, and these 
"space messengers" are called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays were first discovered
in 1912 by Victor Hess when he set out to explore variations
in the atmosphere's level of radiation, which had been thought to
emanate from the Earth's crust. By taking measurements on board
a flying balloon during an eclipse, Hess demonstrated both that
the radiation actually increased at greater altitudes
and that the sun could not be its source. The startling conclusion was that 
it wasn't coming from anywhere within the Earth's atmosphere
but from outer space. Our universe is composed of many
astronomical objects. BIllions of stars of all sizes, black holes,
active galactic nuclei, astroids, planets and more. During violent disturbances, such as a
large star exploding into a supernova, billions of particles are 
emitted into space. Although they are called rays, cosmic rays consist of these 
high energy particles rather than the photons that
make up light rays. While the light from an explosion
travels in a straight line at its famous constant speed, the particles are trapped
in extraordinary loops by magnetic shockwaves 
generated by the explosion. Crossing back and forth
through these magnetic field lines accelerates them to almost the speed of
light before they escape. There are lots of cosmic rays in space,
and some of these particles have traveled for billions of years before reaching Earth. When they enter our atmosphere,
they collide with the molecules there, generating secondary cosmic rays, lighter particles with less energy
than the original. Most of these are absorbed 
into the atmosphere, but some are able to reach the ground,
even passing through our bodies. At sea level, this radiation is fairly low. But people who spend a lot of time
at higher altitudes, such as airline crews,
are exposed to much more. What makes cosmic rays
useful as messengers is that they carry the traces
of their origins. By studying the frequency
with which different particles occur, scientists are able to determine
the relative abundance of elements, such as hydrogen and helium,
within the universe. But cosmic rays may provide
even more fascinating information about the fabric of the universe itself. An experiment called
the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, A.M.S., has recently been installed on board
the International Space Station, containing several detectors that can
separately measure a cosmic ray particle's velocity,
trajectory, radiation, mass and energy, as well as whether the particle
is matter or antimatter. While the two are normally
indistinguishable, their opposite charges enable them
to be detected with the help of a magnet. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is
currently measuring 50 million particles per day with information about each particle being
sent in real time from the space station to the A.M.S. control room at CERN. Over the upcoming months and years, it's expected to yield both amazing
and useful information about antimatter, the possible existence of dark matter, and even possible ways
to mitigate the effects of cosmic radiation on space travel. As we stay tuned for new discoveries,
look to the sky on a clear night, and you may see the
International Space Station, where the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
receives the tiny messengers that carry cosmic secrets.

**Transcript**:
You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA. They encode the molecules that
make up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were
primitive microbes with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start
doing something useful, something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch. As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA. They encode the molecules that
make up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were
primitive microbes with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start
doing something useful, something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch. As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes.

**Transcript**:
Thinking of getting a tattoo? Decorating your birthday suit would add
another personal story to a history of tattoos stretching back
at least 8000 years. Tattooed mummies from around the world
attest to the universality of body modification
across the millennia, and to the fact that you really were
stuck with it forever if your civilization never got around
to inventing laser removal. A mummy from the Chinchorro culture
in pre-Incan Peru has a mustache tattooed
on his upper lip. √ñtzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has
patterned charcoal tats along his spine, behind his knee 
and around his ankles, which might be from an early
sort of acupuncture. The mummy of Amunet, a priestess 
in Middle Kingdom Egypt, features tattoos thought to symbolize
sexuality and fertility. Even older than the mummies, figurines of seemingly tattooed
people, and tools possibly used for tattooing
date back tens of thousands of years. Tattoos don't have one historical
origin point that we know of, but why do we English speakers
call them all tattoos? The word is an anglophonic modification
of "tatao," a Polynesian word used in Tahiti, where English captain James Cook
landed in 1769 and encountered heavily tattooed
men and women. Stories of Cook's findings
and the tattoos his crew acquired cemented our usage of "tattoo" 
over previous words like "scarring," "painting," and "staining," and sparked a craze in Victorian
English high society. We might think of Victorians
having Victorian attitudes about such a risque thing, and you can find such sentiments, and even
bans, on tattooing throughout history. But while publicly some Brits looked down
their noses at tattoos, behind closed doors 
and away from their noses, lots of people had them. Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger
fighting a python, and tattoos became very popular
among Cook's fellow soldiers, who used them to note their travels. You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor. Been south of the Equator?
Time for your turtle tat. But Westerners sported tattoos 
long before meeting the Samoans and Maori 
of the South Pacific. Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross
so if they died in battle, they'd get a Christian burial. Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall
had military tattoos and called the Picts beyond it "Picts,"
for the pictures painted on them. There's also a long tradition
of people being tattooed unwillingly. Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves
and mercenaries to discourage escape and desertion. Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such
as far back as the 7th century. Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed
numbers on the chest or arms of Jews and other prisoners
at the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify stripped corpses. But tattoos forced on prisoners
and outcasts can be redefined as people take ownership
of that status or history. Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore
short sleeves to Germany after the war to remind people of the crime
his number represented. Today, some Holocaust 
survivors' descendants have their relatives numbers'
tattooed on their arms. The Torah has rules against tattoos, but what if you want to make indelible
what you feel should never be forgotten? And those criminals and outcasts of Japan,
where tattooing was eventually outlawed from the mid-19th century to 
just after World War II, added decoration to their penal tattoos, with designs borrowed from
woodblock prints, popular literature and mythical spirtual iconography. Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos
as signs of lifelong loyalty and courage. After all, they lasted forever
and it really hurt to get them. For the Maori, those tattoos were an
accepted mainstream tradition. If you shied away from the excruciating
chiseling in of your moko design, your unfinished tattoo marked
your cowardice. Today, unless you go the traditional route, your tattoo artist will probably use
a tattoo machine based on the one patented by
Samuel O'Reilly in 1891, itself based on Thomas Edison's
stencil machine from 1876. But with the incredibly broad history
of tattoos giving you so many options, what are you going to get? This is a bold-lined expression of
who you are, or you want to appear to be. As the naturalist aboard Cook's ship
said of the tataoed Tahitians, "Everyone is marked, thus in different
parts of his body, according maybe to his humor
or different circumstances of his life." Maybe your particular humor
and circumstances suggest getting a symbol
of cultural heritage, a sign of spirituality,
sexual energy, or good old-fashioned
avant-garde defiance. A reminder of a great accomplishment, or of how you think it would look
cool if Hulk Hogan rode a Rhino. It's your expression, your body, 
so it's your call. Just two rules: you have to find a tattooist who
won't be ashamed to draw your idea, and when in doubt, 
you can never go wrong with "Mom."

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Thinking of getting a tattoo? Decorating your birthday suit would add
another personal story to a history of tattoos stretching back
at least 8000 years. Tattooed mummies from around the world
attest to the universality of body modification
across the millennia, and to the fact that you really were
stuck with it forever if your civilization never got around
to inventing laser removal. A mummy from the Chinchorro culture
in pre-Incan Peru has a mustache tattooed
on his upper lip. √ñtzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has
patterned charcoal tats along his spine, behind his knee 
and around his ankles, which might be from an early
sort of acupuncture. The mummy of Amunet, a priestess 
in Middle Kingdom Egypt, features tattoos thought to symbolize
sexuality and fertility. Even older than the mummies, figurines of seemingly tattooed
people, and tools possibly used for tattooing
date back tens of thousands of years. Tattoos don't have one historical
origin point that we know of, but why do we English speakers
call them all tattoos? The word is an anglophonic modification
of "tatao," a Polynesian word used in Tahiti, where English captain James Cook
landed in 1769 and encountered heavily tattooed
men and women. Stories of Cook's findings
and the tattoos his crew acquired cemented our usage of "tattoo" 
over previous words like "scarring," "painting," and "staining," and sparked a craze in Victorian
English high society. We might think of Victorians
having Victorian attitudes about such a risque thing, and you can find such sentiments, and even
bans, on tattooing throughout history. But while publicly some Brits looked down
their noses at tattoos, behind closed doors 
and away from their noses, lots of people had them. Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger
fighting a python, and tattoos became very popular
among Cook's fellow soldiers, who used them to note their travels. You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor. Been south of the Equator?
Time for your turtle tat. But Westerners sported tattoos 
long before meeting the Samoans and Maori 
of the South Pacific. Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross
so if they died in battle, they'd get a Christian burial. Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall
had military tattoos and called the Picts beyond it "Picts,"
for the pictures painted on them. There's also a long tradition
of people being tattooed unwillingly. Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves
and mercenaries to discourage escape and desertion. Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such
as far back as the 7th century. Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed
numbers on the chest or arms of Jews and other prisoners
at the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify stripped corpses. But tattoos forced on prisoners
and outcasts can be redefined as people take ownership
of that status or history. Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore
short sleeves to Germany after the war to remind people of the crime
his number represented. Today, some Holocaust 
survivors' descendants have their relatives numbers'
tattooed on their arms. The Torah has rules against tattoos, but what if you want to make indelible
what you feel should never be forgotten? And those criminals and outcasts of Japan,
where tattooing was eventually outlawed from the mid-19th century to 
just after World War II, added decoration to their penal tattoos, with designs borrowed from
woodblock prints, popular literature and mythical spirtual iconography. Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos
as signs of lifelong loyalty and courage. After all, they lasted forever
and it really hurt to get them. For the Maori, those tattoos were an
accepted mainstream tradition. If you shied away from the excruciating
chiseling in of your moko design, your unfinished tattoo marked
your cowardice. Today, unless you go the traditional route, your tattoo artist will probably use
a tattoo machine based on the one patented by
Samuel O'Reilly in 1891, itself based on Thomas Edison's
stencil machine from 1876. But with the incredibly broad history
of tattoos giving you so many options, what are you going to get? This is a bold-lined expression of
who you are, or you want to appear to be. As the naturalist aboard Cook's ship
said of the tataoed Tahitians, "Everyone is marked, thus in different
parts of his body, according maybe to his humor
or different circumstances of his life." Maybe your particular humor
and circumstances suggest getting a symbol
of cultural heritage, a sign of spirituality,
sexual energy, or good old-fashioned
avant-garde defiance. A reminder of a great accomplishment, or of how you think it would look
cool if Hulk Hogan rode a Rhino. It's your expression, your body, 
so it's your call. Just two rules: you have to find a tattooist who
won't be ashamed to draw your idea, and when in doubt, 
you can never go wrong with "Mom."

**Transcript**:
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture. It says that you can never simultaneously
know the exact position and the exact speed of an object
and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism
to sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result
of measurement, that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa. The real origin is much deeper
and more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position
and exact speed of an object have no meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means
to behave like a particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time. We can represent this by a graph
showing the probability of finding the object at a particular place,
which looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position,
and zero everywhere else. Waves, on the other hand,
are disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering 
the surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features
of the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two 
neighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability of 
being in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for
quantum physics because an object's wavelength
is related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to 
a very short wavelength. A heavy object has lots of momentum
even if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength. This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a 
trillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect. Small things, 
like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough
to measure in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, 
we can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum,
but it has no position. We can know a particles position
very well, but it doesn't have a wavelength,
so we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both position
and momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves,
but only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves 
with different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some
possibility of having different momenta. When we add two waves, 
we find that there are places where the peaks line up,
making a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one
fill in the valleys of the other. The result has regions where
we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out
get bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still,
with the wavier regions becoming narrower. If we keep adding waves,
we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength
in one small region. That's a quantum object with both
wave and particle nature, but to accomplish this,
we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't restricted 
to a single point. There's a good probability
of finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet
by adding lots of waves, which means there's 
some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding
to any one of those. Both position and momentum
are now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected. If you want to reduce 
the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet,
you need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want to know the momentum better,
you need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927. This uncertainty isn't a matter
of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result
of combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just 
a practical limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties 
an object can have, built into the fundamental structure
of the universe itself.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture. It says that you can never simultaneously
know the exact position and the exact speed of an object
and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism
to sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result
of measurement, that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa. The real origin is much deeper
and more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position
and exact speed of an object have no meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means
to behave like a particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time. We can represent this by a graph
showing the probability of finding the object at a particular place,
which looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position,
and zero everywhere else. Waves, on the other hand,
are disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering 
the surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features
of the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two 
neighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability of 
being in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for
quantum physics because an object's wavelength
is related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to 
a very short wavelength. A heavy object has lots of momentum
even if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength. This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a 
trillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect. Small things, 
like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough
to measure in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, 
we can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum,
but it has no position. We can know a particles position
very well, but it doesn't have a wavelength,
so we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both position
and momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves,
but only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves 
with different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some
possibility of having different momenta. When we add two waves, 
we find that there are places where the peaks line up,
making a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one
fill in the valleys of the other. The result has regions where
we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out
get bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still,
with the wavier regions becoming narrower. If we keep adding waves,
we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength
in one small region. That's a quantum object with both
wave and particle nature, but to accomplish this,
we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't restricted 
to a single point. There's a good probability
of finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet
by adding lots of waves, which means there's 
some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding
to any one of those. Both position and momentum
are now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected. If you want to reduce 
the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet,
you need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want to know the momentum better,
you need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927. This uncertainty isn't a matter
of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result
of combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just 
a practical limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties 
an object can have, built into the fundamental structure
of the universe itself.

One of the most amazing facts 
in physics is this: everything in the universe, from light
to electrons to atoms, behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. All of the other weird stuff you might
have heard about quantum physics, Schrodinger's Cat, God playing dice,
spooky action at a distance, all of it follows directly from the fact that everything has both 
particle and wave nature. This might sound crazy. If you look around, you'll see waves
in water and particles of rock, and they're nothing alike. So why would you think to combine them? Physicists didn't just decide to mash
these things together out of no where. Rather, they were led to 
the dual nature of the universe through a process of small steps, fitting together lots of bits of evidence,
like pieces in a puzzle. The first person to seriously 
suggest the dual nature of light was Albert Einstein in 1905, but he was picking up an 
earlier idea from Max Planck. Planck explained the colors of light
emitted by hot objects, like the filament in a light bulb, but to do it, he needed a desperate trick: he said the object was 
made up of oscillators that could only emit light
in discrete chunks, units of energy that depend on 
the frequency of the light. Planck was never really happy with this,
but Einstein picked it up and ran with it. He applied Planck's idea to light itself,
saying that light, which everybody knew was a wave,
is really a stream of photons, each with a discrete amount of energy. Einstein himself called this
the only truly revolutionary thing he did, but it explains the way light shining on 
a metal surface knocks loose electrons. Even people who hated the idea
had to agree that it works brilliantly. The next puzzle piece came from 
Ernest Rutherford in England. In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,
working for Rutherford, shot alpha particles at gold atoms and were stunned to find that some
bounced straight backwards. This showed that most of the mass of the 
atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus. The cartoon atom you learn 
in grade school, with electrons orbiting
like a miniature solar system, that's Rutherford's. There's one little problem with
Rutherford's atom: it can't work. Classical physics tells us
that an electron whipping around in a circle emits light, and we use this all the time
to generate radio waves and X-rays. Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays
in all directions for a brief instant before the electron spirals in
to crash into the nucleus. But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical
physicist working with Rutherford, pointed out that atoms obviously exist, so maybe the rules of physics 
needed to change. Bohr proposed that an electron
in certain special orbits doesn't emit any light at all. Atoms absorb and emit light
only when electrons change orbits, and the frequency of the light
depends on the energy difference in just the way Planck
and Einstein introduced. Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem and explains why atoms emit only
very specific colors of light. Each element has its own special orbits, and thus its own unique
set of frequencies. The Bohr model has one tiny problem: there's no reason for 
those orbits to be special. But Louis de Broglie, 
a French PhD student, brought everything full circle. He pointed out that if light,
which everyone knew is a wave, behaves like a particle, maybe the electron, 
which everyone knew is a particle, behaves like a wave. And if electrons are waves, it's easy to explain Bohr's rule
for picking out the special orbits. Once you have the idea that 
electrons behave like waves, you can go look for it. And within a few years, 
scientists in the US and UK had observed wave behavior from electrons. These days we have a wonderfully clear
demonstration of this: shooting single electrons at a barrier
with slits cut in it. Each electron is detected 
at a specific place at a specific time, like a particle. But when you repeat the experiment
many times, all the individual electrons trace out
a pattern of stripes, characteristic of wave behavior. The idea that particles behave like waves,
and vice versa, is one of the strangest
and most powerful in physics. Richard Feynman famously said that this illustrates the central mystery
of quantum mechanics. Everything else follows from this, like pieces of a puzzle 
falling into place.

these things together out of no where. Rather, they were led to 
the dual nature of the universe through a process of small steps, fitting together lots of bits of evidence,
like pieces in a puzzle. The first person to seriously 
suggest the dual nature of light was Albert Einstein in 1905, but he was picking up an 
earlier idea from Max Planck. Planck explained the colors of light
emitted by hot objects, like the filament in a light bulb, but to do it, he needed a desperate trick: he said the object was 
made up of oscillators that could only emit light
in discrete chunks, units of energy that depend on 
the frequency of the light. Planck was never really happy with this,
but Einstein picked it up and ran with it. He applied Planck's idea to light itself,
saying that light, which everybody knew was a wave,
is really a stream of photons, each with a discrete amount of energy. Einstein himself called this
the only truly revolutionary thing he did, but it explains the way light shining on 
a metal surface knocks loose electrons. Even people who hated the idea
had to agree that it works brilliantly. The next puzzle piece came from 
Ernest Rutherford in England. In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,
working for Rutherford, shot alpha particles at gold atoms and were stunned to find that some
bounced straight backwards. This showed that most of the mass of the 
atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus. The cartoon atom you learn 
in grade school, with electrons orbiting
like a miniature solar system, that's Rutherford's. There's one little problem with
Rutherford's atom: it can't work. Classical physics tells us
that an electron whipping around in a circle emits light, and we use this all the time
to generate radio waves and X-rays. Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays
in all directions for a brief instant before the electron spirals in
to crash into the nucleus. But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical
physicist working with Rutherford, pointed out that atoms obviously exist, so maybe the rules of physics 
needed to change. Bohr proposed that an electron
in certain special orbits doesn't emit any light at all. Atoms absorb and emit light
only when electrons change orbits, and the frequency of the light
depends on the energy difference in just the way Planck
and Einstein introduced. Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem and explains why atoms emit only
very specific colors of light. Each element has its own special orbits, and thus its own unique
set of frequencies. The Bohr model has one tiny problem: there's no reason for 
those orbits to be special. But Louis de Broglie, 
a French PhD student, brought everything full circle. He pointed out that if light,
which everyone knew is a wave, behaves like a particle, maybe the electron, 
which everyone knew is a particle, behaves like a wave. And if electrons are waves, it's easy to explain Bohr's rule
for picking out the special orbits. Once you have the idea that 
electrons behave like waves, you can go look for it. And within a few years, 
scientists in the US and UK had observed wave behavior from electrons. These days we have a wonderfully clear
demonstration of this: shooting single electrons at a barrier
with slits cut in it. Each electron is detected 
at a specific place at a specific time, like a particle. But when you repeat the experiment
many times, all the individual electrons trace out
a pattern of stripes, characteristic of wave behavior. The idea that particles behave like waves,
and vice versa, is one of the strangest
and most powerful in physics. Richard Feynman famously said that this illustrates the central mystery
of quantum mechanics. Everything else follows from this, like pieces of a puzzle 
falling into place.

One of the most amazing facts 
in physics is this: everything in the universe, from light
to electrons to atoms, behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time. All of the other weird stuff you might

particle and wave nature. This might sound crazy. If you look around, you'll see waves

**Transcript**:
So you just strained a muscle
and the inflammation is unbearable. You wish you had something 
ice-cold to dull the pain, but to use an ice pack, you would have had
to put it in the freezer hours ago. Fortunately, there's another option. A cold pack can be left at room temperature
until the moment you need it, then just snap it as instructed
and within seconds you'll feel the chill. But how can something go from 
room temperature to near freezing in such a short time? The answer lies in chemistry. Your cold pack contains water
and a solid compound, usually ammonium nitrate, in different
compartments separated by a barrier. When the barrier is broken,
the solid dissolves causing what's known as an 
endothermic reaction, one that absorbs heat from its surroundings. To understand how this works, we need to look at the two driving forces
behind chemical processes: energetics and entropy. These determine whether a change occurs in
a system and how energy flows if it does. In chemistry, energetics deals with
the attractive and repulsive forces between particles at the molecular level. This scale is so small that there are
more water molecules in a single glass than there are known stars in the universe. And all of these trillions 
of molecules are constantly moving, vibrating 
and rotating at different rates. We can think of temperature as
a measurement of the average motion, or kinetic energy, of all these particles, with an increase in movement
meaning an increase in temperature, and vice versa. The flow of heat in any 
chemical transformation depends on the relative strength
of particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states. When particles have a strong mutual
attractive force, they move rapidly towards one another,
until they get so close, that repulsive forces push them away. If the initial attraction was 
strong enough, the particles will keep vibrating back
and forth in this way. The stronger the attraction,
the faster their movement, and since heat is essentially motion, when a substance changes to a state
in which these interactions are stronger, the system heats up. But our cold packs do the opposite, which means that when 
the solid dissolves in the water, the new interactions of solid particles 
and water molecules with each other are weaker than the separate interactions
that existed before. This makes both types of particles 
slow down on average, cooling the whole solution. But why would a substance change to a
state where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting
interactions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes 
how objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,
there are many different possible arrangements for the trillions of particles 
that compose it. Some of these will have all 
the oxygen molecules in one area, and all the nitrogen molecules in another. But far more will have them 
mixed together, which is why air is always
found in this state. Now, if there are strong
attractive forces between particles, the probability of some configurations
can change even to the point where the odds
don't favor certain substances mixing. Oil and water not mixing is an example. But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,
or other substance in your cold pack, the attractive forces are not 
strong enough to change the odds, and random motion makes the particles
composing the solid separate by dissolving into the water
and never returning to their solid state. To put it simply, your cold pack gets 
cold because random motion creates more configurations where 
the solid and water mix together and all of these have even weaker
particle interaction, less overall particle movement, and less heat than there was 
inside the unused pack. So while the disorder that can result
from entropy may have caused your injury
in the first place, its also responsible for that
comforting cold that soothes your pain.

state where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting
interactions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes 
how objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,
there are many different possible arrangements for the trillions of particles 
that compose it. Some of these will have all 
the oxygen molecules in one area, and all the nitrogen molecules in another. But far more will have them 
mixed together, which is why air is always
found in this state. Now, if there are strong
attractive forces between particles, the probability of some configurations
can change even to the point where the odds
don't favor certain substances mixing. Oil and water not mixing is an example. But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,
or other substance in your cold pack, the attractive forces are not 
strong enough to change the odds, and random motion makes the particles
composing the solid separate by dissolving into the water
and never returning to their solid state. To put it simply, your cold pack gets 
cold because random motion creates more configurations where 
the solid and water mix together and all of these have even weaker
particle interaction, less overall particle movement, and less heat than there was 
inside the unused pack. So while the disorder that can result
from entropy may have caused your injury
in the first place, its also responsible for that
comforting cold that soothes your pain.

**Transcript**:
So you just strained a muscle
and the inflammation is unbearable. You wish you had something 
ice-cold to dull the pain, but to use an ice pack, you would have had
to put it in the freezer hours ago. Fortunately, there's another option. A cold pack can be left at room temperature
until the moment you need it, then just snap it as instructed
and within seconds you'll feel the chill. But how can something go from 
room temperature to near freezing in such a short time? The answer lies in chemistry. Your cold pack contains water
and a solid compound, usually ammonium nitrate, in different
compartments separated by a barrier. When the barrier is broken,
the solid dissolves causing what's known as an 
endothermic reaction, one that absorbs heat from its surroundings. To understand how this works, we need to look at the two driving forces
behind chemical processes: energetics and entropy. These determine whether a change occurs in
a system and how energy flows if it does. In chemistry, energetics deals with
the attractive and repulsive forces between particles at the molecular level. This scale is so small that there are
more water molecules in a single glass than there are known stars in the universe. And all of these trillions 
of molecules are constantly moving, vibrating 
and rotating at different rates. We can think of temperature as
a measurement of the average motion, or kinetic energy, of all these particles, with an increase in movement
meaning an increase in temperature, and vice versa. The flow of heat in any 
chemical transformation depends on the relative strength
of particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states. When particles have a strong mutual
attractive force, they move rapidly towards one another,
until they get so close, that repulsive forces push them away. If the initial attraction was 
strong enough, the particles will keep vibrating back
and forth in this way. The stronger the attraction,
the faster their movement, and since heat is essentially motion, when a substance changes to a state
in which these interactions are stronger, the system heats up. But our cold packs do the opposite, which means that when 
the solid dissolves in the water, the new interactions of solid particles 
and water molecules with each other are weaker than the separate interactions
that existed before. This makes both types of particles 
slow down on average, cooling the whole solution. But why would a substance change to a
state where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting
interactions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes 
how objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,
