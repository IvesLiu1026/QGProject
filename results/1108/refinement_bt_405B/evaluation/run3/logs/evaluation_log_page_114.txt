**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 4: According to Sarah Longwell, what is the most traumatic experience for a human being? Options: A. Experiencing a natural disaster, B. Suffering a personal loss, C. Facing a financial crisis, D. Being rejected by one's tribe Correct Option: D**

However, the options in this question do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that specifically asks why being rejected by one's tribe is traumatic, rather than what the most traumatic experience is.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the reason behind the trauma of being rejected by one's tribe, with options that include the need for community and belonging.

Since such a question is not present in the generated MCQs, I will provide an alternative solution. We can consider **Question 4** as a starting point and modify it to better match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index from the existing generated MCQs, I would choose **4**, with the understanding that the question and options may need to be adjusted to better match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the reason behind the trauma of being rejected by one's tribe, with options that include the need for community and belonging.

If I were to recreate a more suitable generated MCQ, it would be:

**Question: According to Sarah Longwell, why is being rejected by one's tribe considered traumatic? Options: A. It threatens one's survival instincts, B. Humans have an inherent need for community and belonging, C. It leads to physical harm from predators, D. It results in social isolation Correct Option: B**

for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic

because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock

and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: What was the name of the group that Sarah Longwell helped create to encourage Republicans to vote against Donald Trump?** is not the most similar, however a passage related to the correct answer is.

The correct answer is not present, however the passage that contains the answer to the ground truth MCQ is near **Question 7**. According to the passage near Question 7, "People could maintain their Republican identity. So once we launched Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase "safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant they couldn't vote for Donald Trump."

This passage contains the answer to the ground truth MCQ and is located near Question 7, however the question itself does not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the options provided, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

If I had to choose an index from the provided options, I would choose **9**, but keep in mind that the options in the generated MCQ are not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be:

**Question: What does Longwell suggest as the ultimate strategy for defending democracy in the long term?**

Options: A. Winning elections and securing power for one's own party, B. Building a dominant political coalition using permission structures and trusted messengers, C. Discrediting political opponents through smear campaigns and propaganda, D. Persuading voters to prioritize democracy over party loyalty

Correct Option: D

Unfortunately, this exact question is not present in the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 2: What was the outcome of the experiment conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with over 10,000 participants?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the method used to test whether group discussions improve decision-making.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 3 is not a perfect match, but Question 6 and Question 7 provide some context about the method used. However, none of the questions directly ask about the method used to test whether group discussions improve decision-making.**

If I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 2** provides some context about the experiment, but it's not a direct match.

However, I must note that **Question 6 and Question 7** provide some context about the method used and **Question 3** is related to the experiment but not directly to the method used.

But if I really had to choose one that is the most similar I would say **Question 2**, but keep in mind it's not a perfect match.

But after re-reading the text I can see that **Question 6** has the phrase "deliberation" which can imply a method, so it could be argued that **Question 6** is the most similar one.

So my final answer is: **6**

make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 3: What type of issues did the experiment in Vancouver, Canada, focus on? Options: A. Simple right-or-wrong answers, B. Social and political issues, C. Moral dilemmas, D. Both B and C Correct Option: D

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that discusses the diversity of moral opinions among the TED conference participants.

A closer match would be:

None of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would choose:

Question 4: In the experiment, what was the role of "high-confident grays" in reaching a consensus? Options: A. They hindered the group from reaching a consensus, B. They had no significant impact on the group's decision, C. They helped the group reach a consensus by understanding the merits of both arguments, D. They dominated the discussion and imposed their opinions Correct Option: C

This question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ but it does discuss the diversity of opinions and how some individuals (high-confident grays) can help reach a consensus by understanding different perspectives.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the trend observed in the moral judgments of TED conference participants, and none of the generated MCQs ask this specific question.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing diversity of opinions.

Index: 4 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled
by how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing
focus groups all the time, because I was like, "I've got
to figure out what is going on." Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like
about focus groups is you learn as much from what voters
don't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, "Boy, I really like Trump,
because he has authoritarian vibes." (Laughter) They just don't care
about the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock
that it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy
for his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House
to enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets
the benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters
who didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled
at direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks
were coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... "the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,
we're not doing that. So we had to figure out
how to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary
permission structures to help disaffected Republicans
break from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going
to make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed
trusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust
Republican politicians. But then, we had
a little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people
video testimonials. Little videos, just of regular
people, Republicans, talking about why
they couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out
the one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any
special knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans
who didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,
to send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,
because it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,
they'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,
it was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going
to vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want
their neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want
their parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid
to go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,
scrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,
we knew we had a new tribe. We called it "Republican Voters
Against Trump." People could maintain
their Republican identity. So once we launched
Republican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials
came flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people
who felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase
"safety in numbers" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials
mentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became
Republicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant
they couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot
about how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it
to put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president
who was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, "OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.
What about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch
of Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going
to make up the margins, they never talked about democracy
in the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want
to vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think
they were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters
don’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand
and value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air
we breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see
when it's under threat. And that's why we can't
just say "democracy" and expect everybody's going to have
a shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked
to a Republican, and you said, "What's the biggest threat to democracy?" they’d tell you, “Democrats,
because they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, "What's the biggest
threat to democracy?" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop
talking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people
to put democracy over party, then we better explain to people
what democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up
a liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,
the rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell
a better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated
on our democratic values, that tribe is big enough
and strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other
little tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people
to that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment
for American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive
in other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version
of the Republican Party by telling people
to put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built
Republican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures
and trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw
for every margin. Because if we can win
right now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling
this better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters
don't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend
democracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy
for a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them
to put democracy over party. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi, guys! I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is "Survivor." (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take
a bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire
and, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,
they vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it
in 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show
is so popular and enduring is because we can all
really relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,
people who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing
more traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts
for as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics
is defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic
"Democracy over party," which essentially means
asking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --
I didn't want to do it, because I've listened
to thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel
nearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters
don't think about democracy at all. I learned this one
the hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,
traditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump
was doing to my party. And so I thought
somebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor
and some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,
"You've got to primary this guy." But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary
against Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch
of polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,
to these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans
wanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought
that he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting
democracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he
“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.

**Transcript**:
As societies, we have to make
collective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times
does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five, and invited them
to come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking
with others in small groups, crowds collectively
come up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups also help us decide
on social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time
at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present
to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide
in a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think
they're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,
at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations. This allows parents
to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again
that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity
we found a trend. The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down, and that it is wrong
to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have
extreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed
to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence
of the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times
"Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,
in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average." In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers, and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group. It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights. Good collective decisions
require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision while still maintaining
diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political
and ideological issues. But in a time when
the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.
