Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome. Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features 
looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly
stolen from a dream. Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces
accompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words
and vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from
the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle
over it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all
the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that
in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear
with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see. The letters are varied 
in style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique. The taller letters have been named
gallows characters. The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two
or more hands, with the painting done 
by yet another party. Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed
to hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money
off a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author
was a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken
but not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed. Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say. Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by 
the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand 
the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the
Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was
written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little
light on the mystery. The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have
traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague
to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code,
what might we find? The dream journal of

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it does address a similar topic - the nature of the text in the Voynich manuscript. The correct option for Question 4 (B. It's written in cypher, it's a hoax, and it's written in an unknown script) includes the idea that the manuscript is written in an unknown script, which aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (B. An unknown script and language).

However, a more suitable match can be found by slightly adjusting the interpretation. Question 5 discusses a script that the Voynich manuscript is speculated to be similar to, and it implies that the manuscript's script is unknown. 

But the best match is actually Question 10's Option B and the discussion around Question 3, which, when combined, would closely match the Ground Truth MCQ's content and intent.

Since none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, the closest match would be a combination or an interpretation of the provided MCQs.

However, if I had to choose one of the provided MCQs, I would say Question 4 is the closest match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the person who discovered the Voynich manuscript. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 7 mentions two historical figures that some people believe might have written the Voynich manuscript, but it does not ask about the person who discovered it.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. This information is related to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 7, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

A more suitable approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about Wilfrid Voynich, such as:

Question: Who is credited with discovering the Voynich manuscript in 1912?
Options: A. Wilfrid Voynich, B. Roger Bacon, C. John Dee, D. Jacobus Sinapius

Since this option is not available among the generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. However, if I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but not a direct match.

Index: 7 (with a note that it's not a direct match)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what the Voynich manuscript does NOT contain, with options related to the content of the manuscript. Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the closest in terms of content, as it asks about what the Voynich manuscript might contain if it is an attempt to create a new form of written language. However, the question intent and options are not a direct match.

A more suitable approach would be to look for a generated MCQ that asks about the content of the Voynich manuscript. Question 3 is related to the writing in the Voynich manuscript, but it does not ask about what the manuscript contains.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will select the one that is most closely related to the content of the Voynich manuscript.

**Transcript**:
Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke
Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome. Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features 
looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly
stolen from a dream. Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces
accompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words
and vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from
the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle
over it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all
the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that
in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear
with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see. The letters are varied 
in style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique. The taller letters have been named
gallows characters. The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two
or more hands, with the painting done 
by yet another party. Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed
to hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money
off a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author
was a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken
but not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed. Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say. Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by 
the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand 
the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the
Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was
written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little
light on the mystery. The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have
traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague
to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code,
what might we find? The dream journal of 
a 15th-century illustrator? A bunch of nonsense? Or the lost knowledge 
of a forgotten culture? What do you think it is?

**Transcript**:
What do fans of atmospheric 
post-punk music have in common with ancient barbarians? Not much. So why are both known as goths? Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection stretching 
across the centuries? The story begins in Ancient Rome. As the Roman Empire expanded,
it faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations 
along its borders. Among the most powerful were
a Germanic people known as Goths who were composed of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others
into the imperial army. As the Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played
larger roles in its defense and internal power struggles. In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt
lead by a soldier named Odoacer captured Rome 
and deposed the Western Emperor. Odoacer and his Ostrogoth
successor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern
Emperor's authority and maintained Roman traditions. But the Western Empire would never
be united again. Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms
ruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many of their names
still mark the map. This was the end of the Classical Period and the beginning of what many call
the Dark Ages. Although Roman culture was never
fully lost, its influence declined
and new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism
and allegory rather than proportion and realism. This shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey
of Saint Denis in France in 1137. Pointed arches, flying buttresses,
and large windows made the structure more skeletal
and ornate. That emphasized its open, 
luminous interior rather than the sturdy walls
and columns of Classical buildings. Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals
throughout Europe. But fashions change. With the Italian Renaissance's renewed
admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem
crude and inferior in comparison. Writing in his 1550 book, 
"Lives of the Artists," Giorgio Vasari was the first
to describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization. The name stuck, and soon came
to describe the Medieval period overall, with its associations of darkness,
superstition, and simplicity. But time marched on,
as did what was considered fashionable. In the 1700s, a period called
the Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason 
above all else. Reacting against that, Romantic authors
like Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past
of natural landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces. Here, the word Gothic 
was repurposed again to describe a literary genre that
emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism. The term was first applied 
by Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, 
"The Castle of Otranto" as a reference to the plot 
and general atmosphere. Many of the novel's elements became
genre staples inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature
and film until the 1970s when a new musical scene emerged. Taking cues from artists like
The Doors and The Velvet Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined gloomy lyrics 
and punk dissonance with imagery inspired 
by the Victorian era, classic horror, and androgynous glam fashion. By the early 1980s, similar bands
were consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it
out of dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV. And today, despite occasional negative
media attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as
a strong underground phenomenon. They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic metal, and even steampunk. The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years 
worth of countercultural movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires 
replacing solid columns to artists finding beauty in darkness. Each step has seen a revolution of sorts and a tendency for civilization to reach into
its past to reshape its present.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it asks about the origin of Gothic music, which is closely related to the post-punk scene. Although the options are not identical, the correct option "B. Post-punk" in Question 8 is closely related to the correct option "B. Punk" in the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about the emergence of Gothic music. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if we re-evaluate the generated MCQs, we can find a question that is more similar in terms of question intent.

**Question 9:** How did the Gothic music and fashion scene evolve by the early 1980s? Options: A. It remained an underground phenomenon, confined to dimly lit clubs., B. It gained popularity and was consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press., C. It branched out into sub-genres such as cybergoth and gothabilly, but lost mainstream appeal., D. It was negatively stereotyped by the media and lost popularity. Correct Option: B

This question is not directly asking about the emergence of Gothic music but rather its evolution. However, the correct option "B" mentions that the Gothic music scene "gained popularity and was consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press." This implies that the scene emerged from a previous musical movement, which is post-punk.

"The Castle of Otranto" as a reference to the plot 
and general atmosphere. Many of the novel's elements became
genre staples inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature
and film until the 1970s when a new musical scene emerged. Taking cues from artists like
The Doors and The Velvet Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined gloomy lyrics 
and punk dissonance with imagery inspired 
by the Victorian era, classic horror, and androgynous glam fashion. By the early 1980s, similar bands
were consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it
out of dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV. And today, despite occasional negative
media attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as
a strong underground phenomenon. They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic metal, and even steampunk. The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years 
worth of countercultural movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires 
replacing solid columns to artists finding beauty in darkness. Each step has seen a revolution of sorts and a tendency for civilization to reach into
its past to reshape its present.

What do fans of atmospheric 
post-punk music have in common with ancient barbarians? Not much. So why are both known as goths? Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection stretching 
across the centuries? The story begins in Ancient Rome. As the Roman Empire expanded,
it faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations 
along its borders. Among the most powerful were
a Germanic people known as Goths who were composed of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others
into the imperial army. As the Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played
larger roles in its defense and internal power struggles. In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt
lead by a soldier named Odoacer captured Rome 
and deposed the Western Emperor. Odoacer and his Ostrogoth
successor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern
Emperor's authority and maintained Roman traditions. But the Western Empire would never
be united again. Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms
ruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many of their names
still mark the map. This was the end of the Classical Period and the beginning of what many call
the Dark Ages. Although Roman culture was never
fully lost, its influence declined
and new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism
and allegory rather than proportion and realism. This shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey
of Saint Denis in France in 1137. Pointed arches, flying buttresses,
and large windows made the structure more skeletal
and ornate. That emphasized its open, 
luminous interior rather than the sturdy walls
and columns of Classical buildings. Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals
throughout Europe. But fashions change. With the Italian Renaissance's renewed
admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem
crude and inferior in comparison. Writing in his 1550 book, 
"Lives of the Artists," Giorgio Vasari was the first
to describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization. The name stuck, and soon came
to describe the Medieval period overall, with its associations of darkness,
superstition, and simplicity. But time marched on,
as did what was considered fashionable. In the 1700s, a period called
the Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason 
above all else. Reacting against that, Romantic authors
like Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past
of natural landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces. Here, the word Gothic 
was repurposed again to describe a literary genre that
emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism. The term was first applied 
by Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, 
"The Castle of Otranto" as a reference to the plot 
and general atmosphere. Many of the novel's elements became
genre staples inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature

**Transcript**:
Have you ever wondered what
happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it? Medicine that slides down
your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs
to go in the first place? The answer is that it hitches
a ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race
to do its job before it's snared by organs
and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts 
in your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet
for a sore ankle. Within minutes, the tablet starts
disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels
into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall
into a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood,
and anything in it, to the liver. The next step is to make 
it through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules
in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with 
the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules,
called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen
makes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it
into the circulatory blood stream. This blood loop travels through every
limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys,
and back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules 
encounter a location where the body's pain 
response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules
that are a part of that reaction. Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the
production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about
one or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently 
eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half
every two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach
from their targets, the systemic blood stream carries
them away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction
of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys
continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized
and filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for
any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes
it into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions 
on medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on 
a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, 
the medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug 
and its metabolites can be toxic. That's true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients
to get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine
changes quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes
that neutralize medication highly fluctuates 
during infancy and childhood. And that's just one 
of many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's
efficiency of processing medicine. Some day, routine DNA tests may be able
to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency
and other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor
or pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts
with the recommended timing.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever wondered what
happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it? Medicine that slides down
your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs
to go in the first place? The answer is that it hitches
a ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race
to do its job before it's snared by organs
and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts 
in your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet
for a sore ankle. Within minutes, the tablet starts
disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels
into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall
into a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood,
and anything in it, to the liver. The next step is to make 
it through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules
in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with 
the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules,
called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen
makes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it
into the circulatory blood stream. This blood loop travels through every
limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys,
and back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules 
encounter a location where the body's pain 
response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules
that are a part of that reaction. Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the
production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about
one or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently 
eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half
every two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach
from their targets, the systemic blood stream carries
them away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction
of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys
continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized
and filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for
any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes
it into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions 
on medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on 
a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, 
the medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug 
and its metabolites can be toxic. That's true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients
to get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine
changes quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes
that neutralize medication highly fluctuates 
during infancy and childhood. And that's just one 
of many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's
efficiency of processing medicine. Some day, routine DNA tests may be able
to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency
and other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor
or pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts
with the recommended timing.

Today I’m going to tell you about one of
my favorite creatures to ever grace this planet. It’s a frog that’s pretty bizarre but
also weirdly sweet and adorable. Sadly, it went extinct just before I was born,
so I thought I’d never get the chance to see it. But a few years ago, scientists tried to bring
it back from the dead. I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Gastric-brooding frogs were first found in
Queensland, Australia in 1972. They looked pretty normal—just your average
brownish, greenish frog. But there was nothing average about how they
gave birth. A female frog would lay her eggs, and a male
frog would fertilize them externally. So far so normal. But then, the mother frog would swallow the
eggs—around 40 of them! You’d think this would be a terrible idea. After all, stomachs—whether they be frog
or human—usually contain strong acid to break down your last meal. But the eggs likely contained a chemical that
made the mother’s stomach stop producing acid. That meant the mother couldn’t eat during
her pregnancy, which from a human perspective seems awful, but the frogs seemed to make
do. Eventually, tadpoles would hatch from the
eggs. And the tadpoles would release mucus that
contained more of that acid-blocking chemical. The babies would continue to grow in the stomach
for another 6 weeks, getting so big that they’d compress the mother’s lungs. Luckily, these frogs could also breathe through
their skin, so the mothers didn’t suffocate. Finally, the tadpoles would metamorphose into
baby frogs, and the mother would vomit them up—usually one at a time over a few days. Though, when provoked some were known to projectile
vomit all their babies out at once. While barfing up your babies sounds...horrible...it’s
kinda sweet when you think about it. Gastric-brooding, as this strategy is called,
is a way to keep your babies close to you and safe while they’re most vulnerable. It’s really a lot like human pregnancy…only
the babies come out the other end… Anyway, there were two species of these frogs,
but both went extinct by the mid-80s. The culprit was likely an invasive fungus—one
that poses a major threat to amphibians worldwide, and that humans likely helped to spread around
the globe. It’s called chytrid fungus and it affects
a frog’s skin. Because frogs use their skin for crucial functions
like breathing, staying hydrated, and regulating their temperature, the parasite can easily
kill its victims. And it’s highly contagious—by 2013 it
had put 42% of the world’s frog species in danger. Losing all these frogs would be, in a word,
devastating. Not only would it have major impacts on ecosystems
worldwide, and be a loss of beautiful biodiversity, but there is so much we still have to learn
from these creatures that might be beneficial to human health and well-being. Take the gastric-brooding frog. If we’d had more time to study it, maybe
we could have learned more about how it turns off stomach acid production, potentially revealing
some insights that could help humans with GI problems. Consequently, back in 2013, some scientists
began a project to resurrect the gastric-brooding frog. They took cells from a frozen specimen, cloned
the DNA into the egg of another frog species, and ended up creating a living gastric-brooding
frog embryo. It only survived for about three days, but
they haven’t given up trying. And it’s made some researchers hopeful that
“de-extinction”—the process of bringing extinct species back to life—will one day
be a solution for reviving at least some of the valuable biodiversity we’ve lost, often
due to humans’ impact on the environment. Obviously, this is a controversial idea. And, I think most scientists would agree that
de-extinction is a last-gasp effort in conservation. It in no way means we should stop protecting
and preserving the at-risk species we have. That said, while I can’t speak to the ethics
of the situation, I will admit that there’s a pretty big part of me that would love to
see a gastric-brooding frog vomiting up its babies. Ew.

**Transcript**:
There's a concept that's crucial
to chemistry and physics. It helps explain why physical processes
go one way and not the other: why ice melts, why cream spreads in coffee, why air leaks out of a punctured tire. It's entropy, and it's notoriously
difficult to wrap our heads around. Entropy is often described as
a measurement of disorder. That's a convenient image,
but it's unfortunately misleading. For example, which is more disordered - a cup of crushed ice or a glass
of room temperature water? Most people would say the ice, but that actually has lower entropy. So here's another way of thinking
about it through probability. This may be trickier to understand,
but take the time to internalize it and you'll have a much better 
understanding of entropy. Consider two small solids which are comprised 
of six atomic bonds each. In this model, the energy in each solid
is stored in the bonds. Those can be thought of 
as simple containers, which can hold indivisible units of energy
known as quanta. The more energy a solid has,
the hotter it is. It turns out that there are numerous
ways that the energy can be distributed in the two solids and still have the same 
total energy in each. Each of these options 
is called a microstate. For six quanta of energy in Solid A
and two in Solid B, there are 9,702 microstates. Of course, there are other ways our eight
quanta of energy can be arranged. For example, all of the energy
could be in Solid A and none in B, or half in A and half in B. If we assume that each microstate
is equally likely, we can see that some of the energy
configurations have a higher probability of occurring
than others. That's due to their greater number
of microstates. Entropy is a direct measure of each
energy configuration's probability. What we see is that the energy
configuration in which the energy
is most spread out between the solids has the highest entropy. So in a general sense, entropy can be thought of as a measurement
of this energy spread. Low entropy means 
the energy is concentrated. High entropy means it's spread out. To see why entropy is useful for
explaining spontaneous processes, like hot objects cooling down, we need to look at a dynamic system
where the energy moves. In reality, energy doesn't stay put. It continuously moves between 
neighboring bonds. As the energy moves, the energy configuration can change. Because of the distribution 
of microstates, there's a 21% chance that the system
will later be in the configuration in which the energy is maximally 
spread out, there's a 13% chance that it will
return to its starting point, and an 8% chance that A will actually
gain energy. Again, we see that because there are
more ways to have dispersed energy and high entropy than concentrated energy, the energy tends to spread out. That's why if you put a hot object
next to a cold one, the cold one will warm up
and the hot one will cool down. But even in that example, there is an 8% chance that the hot object
would get hotter. Why doesn't this ever happen
in real life? It's all about the size of the system. Our hypothetical solids only had
six bonds each. Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds
and 8,000 units of energy, and again start the system with
three-quarters of the energy in A and one-quarter in B. Now we find that chance of A
spontaneously acquiring more energy is this tiny number. Familiar, everyday objects have many, many
times more particles than this. The chance of a hot object 
in the real world getting hotter is so absurdly small, it just never happens. Ice melts, cream mixes in, and tires deflate because these states have more
dispersed energy than the originals. There's no mysterious force
nudging the system towards higher entropy. It's just that higher entropy is always
statistically more likely. That's why entropy has been called
time's arrow. If energy has the opportunity
to spread out, it will.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, the question content does not perfectly match. Ground Truth MCQ asks whether a system must evolve toward an energy configuration where the energy is maximally spread out and the correct answer is "False". Question 5 asks what happens to the entropy of a system when energy is maximally spread out between its components, which is related but not identical.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks whether a system always evolves towards maximum entropy or if it's just statistically more likely. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose the closest match, I would say Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
There's a concept that's crucial
to chemistry and physics. It helps explain why physical processes
go one way and not the other: why ice melts, why cream spreads in coffee, why air leaks out of a punctured tire. It's entropy, and it's notoriously
difficult to wrap our heads around. Entropy is often described as
a measurement of disorder. That's a convenient image,
but it's unfortunately misleading. For example, which is more disordered - a cup of crushed ice or a glass
of room temperature water? Most people would say the ice, but that actually has lower entropy. So here's another way of thinking
about it through probability. This may be trickier to understand,
but take the time to internalize it and you'll have a much better 
understanding of entropy. Consider two small solids which are comprised 
of six atomic bonds each. In this model, the energy in each solid
is stored in the bonds. Those can be thought of 
as simple containers, which can hold indivisible units of energy
known as quanta. The more energy a solid has,
the hotter it is. It turns out that there are numerous
ways that the energy can be distributed in the two solids and still have the same 
total energy in each. Each of these options 
is called a microstate. For six quanta of energy in Solid A
and two in Solid B, there are 9,702 microstates. Of course, there are other ways our eight
quanta of energy can be arranged. For example, all of the energy
could be in Solid A and none in B, or half in A and half in B. If we assume that each microstate
is equally likely, we can see that some of the energy
configurations have a higher probability of occurring
than others. That's due to their greater number
of microstates. Entropy is a direct measure of each
energy configuration's probability. What we see is that the energy
configuration in which the energy
is most spread out between the solids has the highest entropy. So in a general sense, entropy can be thought of as a measurement
of this energy spread. Low entropy means 
the energy is concentrated. High entropy means it's spread out. To see why entropy is useful for
explaining spontaneous processes, like hot objects cooling down, we need to look at a dynamic system
where the energy moves. In reality, energy doesn't stay put. It continuously moves between 
neighboring bonds. As the energy moves, the energy configuration can change. Because of the distribution 
of microstates, there's a 21% chance that the system
will later be in the configuration in which the energy is maximally 
spread out, there's a 13% chance that it will
return to its starting point, and an 8% chance that A will actually
gain energy. Again, we see that because there are
more ways to have dispersed energy and high entropy than concentrated energy, the energy tends to spread out. That's why if you put a hot object
next to a cold one, the cold one will warm up
and the hot one will cool down. But even in that example, there is an 8% chance that the hot object
would get hotter. Why doesn't this ever happen
in real life? It's all about the size of the system. Our hypothetical solids only had
six bonds each. Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds
and 8,000 units of energy, and again start the system with
three-quarters of the energy in A and one-quarter in B. Now we find that chance of A
spontaneously acquiring more energy is this tiny number. Familiar, everyday objects have many, many
times more particles than this. The chance of a hot object 
in the real world getting hotter is so absurdly small, it just never happens. Ice melts, cream mixes in, and tires deflate because these states have more
dispersed energy than the originals. There's no mysterious force
nudging the system towards higher entropy. It's just that higher entropy is always
statistically more likely. That's why entropy has been called
time's arrow. If energy has the opportunity
to spread out, it will.

There's a concept that's crucial

the hotter it is. It turns out that there are numerous
ways that the energy can be distributed in the two solids and still have the same 
total energy in each. Each of these options 
is called a microstate. For six quanta of energy in Solid A
and two in Solid B, there are 9,702 microstates. Of course, there are other ways our eight
quanta of energy can be arranged. For example, all of the energy
could be in Solid A and none in B, or half in A and half in B. If we assume that each microstate
is equally likely, we can see that some of the energy
configurations have a higher probability of occurring
than others. That's due to their greater number
of microstates. Entropy is a direct measure of each
energy configuration's probability. What we see is that the energy
configuration in which the energy
is most spread out between the solids has the highest entropy. So in a general sense, entropy can be thought of as a measurement
of this energy spread. Low entropy means 
the energy is concentrated. High entropy means it's spread out. To see why entropy is useful for
explaining spontaneous processes, like hot objects cooling down, we need to look at a dynamic system
where the energy moves. In reality, energy doesn't stay put. It continuously moves between 
neighboring bonds. As the energy moves, the energy configuration can change. Because of the distribution 
of microstates, there's a 21% chance that the system
will later be in the configuration in which the energy is maximally 
spread out, there's a 13% chance that it will
return to its starting point, and an 8% chance that A will actually
gain energy. Again, we see that because there are
more ways to have dispersed energy and high entropy than concentrated energy, the energy tends to spread out. That's why if you put a hot object
next to a cold one, the cold one will warm up
and the hot one will cool down. But even in that example, there is an 8% chance that the hot object
would get hotter. Why doesn't this ever happen
in real life? It's all about the size of the system. Our hypothetical solids only had
six bonds each. Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds
and 8,000 units of energy, and again start the system with
three-quarters of the energy in A and one-quarter in B. Now we find that chance of A
spontaneously acquiring more energy is this tiny number. Familiar, everyday objects have many, many
times more particles than this. The chance of a hot object 
in the real world getting hotter is so absurdly small, it just never happens. Ice melts, cream mixes in, and tires deflate because these states have more
dispersed energy than the originals. There's no mysterious force
nudging the system towards higher entropy. It's just that higher entropy is always
statistically more likely. That's why entropy has been called
time's arrow. If energy has the opportunity
to spread out, it will.

**Transcript**:
Imagine a group of people. How big do you think the group
would have to be before there's more than a 50% chance
that two people in the group have the same birthday? Assume for the sake of argument
that there are no twins, that every birthday is equally likely, and ignore leap years. Take a moment to think about it. The answer may seem surprisingly low. In a group of 23 people, there's a 50.73% chance that 
two people will share the same birthday. But with 365 days in a year, how's it possible that you need such
a small group to get even odds of a shared birthday? Why is our intuition so wrong? To figure out the answer, let's look at one way a mathematician might calculate 
the odds of a birthday match. We can use a field of mathematics
known as combinatorics, which deals with the likelihoods
of different combinations. The first step is to flip the problem. Trying to calculate the odds 
of a match directly is challenging because there are many ways you
could get a birthday match in a group. Instead, it's easier to calculate the odds
that everyone's birthday is different. How does that help? Either there's a birthday match
in the group, or there isn't, so the odds of a match
and the odds of no match must add up to 100%. That means we can find 
the probability of a match by subtracting the probability
of no match from 100. To calculate the odds of no match,
start small. Calculate the odds that just one pair
of people have different birthdays. One day of the year will be
Person A's birthday, which leaves only 364 possible birthdays
for Person B. The probability of different birthdays
for A and B, or any pair of people, is 364 out of 365, about 0.997, or 99.7%, pretty high. Bring in Person C. The probability that she has 
a unique birthday in this small group is 363 out of 365 because there are two birthdates
already accounted for by A and B. D's odds will be 362 out of 365,
and so on, all the way down to W's odds
of 343 out of 365. Multiply all of those terms together, and you'll get the probability
that no one shares a birthday. This works out to 0.4927, so there's a 49.27% chance that no one in
the group of 23 people shares a birthday. When we subtract that from 100,
we get a 50.73% chance of at least one birthday match, better than even odds. The key to such a high probability 
of a match in a relatively small group is the surprisingly large number
of possible pairs. As a group grows, the number of possible 
combinations gets bigger much faster. A group of five people 
has ten possible pairs. Each of the five people can be paired
with any of the other four. Half of those combinations are redundant because pairing Person A with Person B
is the same as pairing B with A, so we divide by two. By the same reasoning, a group of ten people has 45 pairs, and a group of 23 has 253. The number of pairs grows quadratically, meaning it's proportional to the square
of the number of people in the group. Unfortunately, our brains 
are notoriously bad at intuitively grasping 
non-linear functions. So it seems improbable at first that 23
people could produce 253 possible pairs. Once our brains accept that,
the birthday problem makes more sense. Every one of those 253 pairs is a chance
for a birthday match. For the same reason,
in a group of 70 people, there are 2,415 possible pairs, and the probability that two people
have the same birthday is more than 99.9%. The birthday problem is just one example
where math can show that things that seem impossible, like the same person winning
the lottery twice, actually aren't unlikely at all. Sometimes coincidences aren't
as coincidental as they seem.

**Transcript**:
Imagine a group of people. How big do you think the group
would have to be before there's more than a 50% chance
that two people in the group have the same birthday? Assume for the sake of argument
that there are no twins, that every birthday is equally likely, and ignore leap years. Take a moment to think about it. The answer may seem surprisingly low. In a group of 23 people, there's a 50.73% chance that 
two people will share the same birthday. But with 365 days in a year, how's it possible that you need such
a small group to get even odds of a shared birthday? Why is our intuition so wrong? To figure out the answer, let's look at one way a mathematician might calculate 
the odds of a birthday match. We can use a field of mathematics
known as combinatorics, which deals with the likelihoods
of different combinations. The first step is to flip the problem. Trying to calculate the odds 
of a match directly is challenging because there are many ways you
could get a birthday match in a group. Instead, it's easier to calculate the odds
that everyone's birthday is different. How does that help? Either there's a birthday match
in the group, or there isn't, so the odds of a match
and the odds of no match must add up to 100%. That means we can find 
the probability of a match by subtracting the probability
of no match from 100. To calculate the odds of no match,
start small. Calculate the odds that just one pair
of people have different birthdays. One day of the year will be
Person A's birthday, which leaves only 364 possible birthdays
for Person B. The probability of different birthdays
for A and B, or any pair of people, is 364 out of 365, about 0.997, or 99.7%, pretty high. Bring in Person C. The probability that she has 
a unique birthday in this small group is 363 out of 365 because there are two birthdates
already accounted for by A and B. D's odds will be 362 out of 365,
and so on, all the way down to W's odds
of 343 out of 365. Multiply all of those terms together, and you'll get the probability
that no one shares a birthday. This works out to 0.4927, so there's a 49.27% chance that no one in
the group of 23 people shares a birthday. When we subtract that from 100,
we get a 50.73% chance of at least one birthday match, better than even odds. The key to such a high probability 
of a match in a relatively small group is the surprisingly large number
of possible pairs. As a group grows, the number of possible 
combinations gets bigger much faster. A group of five people 
has ten possible pairs. Each of the five people can be paired
with any of the other four. Half of those combinations are redundant because pairing Person A with Person B
is the same as pairing B with A, so we divide by two. By the same reasoning, a group of ten people has 45 pairs, and a group of 23 has 253. The number of pairs grows quadratically, meaning it's proportional to the square
of the number of people in the group. Unfortunately, our brains 
are notoriously bad at intuitively grasping 
non-linear functions. So it seems improbable at first that 23
people could produce 253 possible pairs. Once our brains accept that,
the birthday problem makes more sense. Every one of those 253 pairs is a chance
for a birthday match. For the same reason,
in a group of 70 people, there are 2,415 possible pairs, and the probability that two people
have the same birthday is more than 99.9%. The birthday problem is just one example
where math can show that things that seem impossible, like the same person winning
the lottery twice, actually aren't unlikely at all. Sometimes coincidences aren't
as coincidental as they seem.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: In a group of 70 people, what is the probability that at least two people have the same birthday? Options: A. 50%, B. 75%, C. 99.9%, D. 25% Correct Option: C.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the probability of a birthday match in a group of 70 people, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the number of people required to achieve a 99.9% probability of a birthday match.

A more similar question would be one that asks about the number of people required to achieve a certain probability of a birthday match. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 1: What is the minimum number of people required in a group to have more than a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday? Options: A. 50, B. 100, C. 23, D. 365 Correct Option: C.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ in that it asks about the number of people required to achieve a certain probability of a birthday match. However, the probability and the options are different.

To make the generated MCQs more similar to the ground truth MCQ, you could modify Question 1 to ask about the number of people required to achieve a 99.9% probability of a birthday match, like this:

Question: What is the minimum number of people required in a group to have a 99.9% chance that two people share the same birthday? Options: A. 50, B. 70, C. 100, D. 365 Correct Option: B.

This modified question would be a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's a good day to be a pirate. Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins. But now, they must divvy up the booty
according to the pirate code. As captain, Amaro gets to propose
how to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate, 
including Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,
the coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain. Then, Bart gets to propose
a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again. If his plan is rejected,
he walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place. This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel
and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted
or there's only one pirate left. Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive
while getting as much gold as possible. But being pirates, 
none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain
walk the plank just for fun. Finally, each pirate is excellent
at logical deduction and knows that the others are, too. What distribution should Amaro
propose to make sure he lives? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan
being accepted. But it turns out he can do
much better than that. Why? Like we said, the pirates all know
each other to be top-notch logicians. So when each votes, they won't just
be thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes
down the line. And because the rank order is known
in advance, each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly. Because Eliza's last, she has the most
outcomes to consider, so let's start by following 
her thought process. She'd reason this out by working
backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining. Daniel would obviously propose
to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation
at all costs. Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left 
and Charlotte making the proposal. Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,
the decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold
while Eliza gets nothing. So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her
slightly more than nothing, one coin. Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel
anything at all. What if there are four pirates? As captain, Bart would still only need
one other vote for his plan to pass. He knows that Daniel wouldn't want 
the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin
for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote
with all five pirates standing. Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news 
for Charlotte and Eliza. So he offers them one coin each,
keeping 98 for himself. Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza 
grudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative 
would be worse for them. The pirate game involves some interesting
concepts from game theory. One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what
the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning. And the final distribution is an example
of a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other
players' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly. Even though it may lead to a worse
outcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit
by changing their strategy. So it looks like Amaro gets to keep
most of the gold, and the other pirates might need
to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, a closer examination of the options reveals that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, although it doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

But, since the question asks about who gets to propose how to distribute the coins and the correct answer is "Whoever the current captain is", I can infer that the correct generated MCQ should have this as the correct answer or something very similar.

In this case, I can see that Question 6 implies that the captain (Amaro) gets to propose the distribution, and Question 3 also implies that the captain (Daniel) gets to propose the distribution. 

However, I think the generated MCQ that best captures the essence of the ground truth MCQ would be a question that explicitly asks who gets to propose the distribution and has an answer that says something like "The current captain" or "Whoever the current captain is".

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that the generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ does not exist, but if I really had to choose one, I would say:

 Question 2.

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a new generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ would be the best option.

However, I can try to create a new question that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ:

New Question 11: Who gets to propose how to distribute the coins in the pirate game?
Options: A. Amaro, B. Eliza, C. Whoever the current captain is
Correct Option: C

This new question perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's a good day to be a pirate. Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins. But now, they must divvy up the booty
according to the pirate code. As captain, Amaro gets to propose
how to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate, 
including Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,
the coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain. Then, Bart gets to propose
a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again. If his plan is rejected,
he walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place. This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel
and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted
or there's only one pirate left. Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive
while getting as much gold as possible. But being pirates, 
none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain
walk the plank just for fun. Finally, each pirate is excellent
at logical deduction and knows that the others are, too. What distribution should Amaro
propose to make sure he lives? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan
being accepted. But it turns out he can do
much better than that. Why? Like we said, the pirates all know
each other to be top-notch logicians. So when each votes, they won't just
be thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes
down the line. And because the rank order is known
in advance, each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly. Because Eliza's last, she has the most
outcomes to consider, so let's start by following 
her thought process. She'd reason this out by working
backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining. Daniel would obviously propose
to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation
at all costs. Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left 
and Charlotte making the proposal. Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,
the decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold
while Eliza gets nothing. So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her
slightly more than nothing, one coin. Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel
anything at all. What if there are four pirates? As captain, Bart would still only need
one other vote for his plan to pass. He knows that Daniel wouldn't want 
the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin
for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote
with all five pirates standing. Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news 
for Charlotte and Eliza. So he offers them one coin each,
keeping 98 for himself. Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza 
grudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative 
would be worse for them. The pirate game involves some interesting
concepts from game theory. One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what
the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning. And the final distribution is an example
of a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other
players' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly. Even though it may lead to a worse
outcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit
by changing their strategy. So it looks like Amaro gets to keep
most of the gold, and the other pirates might need
to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of the distribution of coins and the pirate's self-interest.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about a condition that is NOT one of the conditions in the pirate code, specifically about the pirate making the proposal offering everyone at least one coin.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, but only because it talks about offering coins to secure votes. However, it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
"War and Peace," a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed
because if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. "War and Peace" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination
of history, populated with some of the deepest, most
realistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,
just image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel
about a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced
a 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric 
aristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already
dropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment
to travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,
his ancestral mansion, to write about the return 
of the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries
pardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story 
of the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against 
the conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling
the story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous 
invasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism
the Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812
without talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of
the threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at 
the Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives 
that inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,
the class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority 
of the Russian population, who were peasants,
or even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners
of the land on which they lived. "War and Peace" opens on the eve
of war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret
about the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things
aristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces 
between the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters
in "War and Peace." Instead, readers enter
a vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless 
and illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive
the battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl
falling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle
with all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors
plays a background part. But while the characters

the narrative to pose insightful 
questions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions

like a novel at all. It was a "large, loose, baggy monster,"
in the words of Henry James. Tolstoy, in fact, agreed. To him, novels were 
a western European form. Russian writers had to write differently
because Russian people lived differently. "What is 'War and Peace'?" he asked. "It is not a novel. Still less an epic poem. Still less a historical chronicle. 'War and Peace' is what the author wanted
and was able to express in the form in which it was expressed." It is, in other words, the sum total
of Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less. By the time "War and Peace" ends, Tolstoy has brought his characters
to the year 1820, 36 years before the events he originally
hoped to write about. In trying to understand his own times, he had become immersed in the years

**Transcript**:
"War and Peace," a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed
because if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. "War and Peace" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination
of history, populated with some of the deepest, most
realistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,
just image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel
about a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced
a 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric 
aristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already
dropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment
to travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,
his ancestral mansion, to write about the return 
of the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries
pardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story 
of the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against 
the conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling
the story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous 
invasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism
the Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812
without talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of
the threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at 
the Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives 
that inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,
the class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority 
of the Russian population, who were peasants,
or even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners
of the land on which they lived. "War and Peace" opens on the eve
of war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret
about the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things
aristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces 
between the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters
in "War and Peace." Instead, readers enter
a vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless 
and illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive
the battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl
falling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle
with all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors
plays a background part. But while the characters 
and their psychologies are gripping, Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt 
the narrative to pose insightful 
questions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions
of so-called great men like Napoleon, or are there larger cultural and economic
forces at play? These extended digressions are part 
of what make "War and Peace" so panoramic in scope. But for some 19th century critics, this meant "War and Peace" barely felt

**Transcript**:
"War and Peace," a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed
because if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. "War and Peace" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination
of history, populated with some of the deepest, most
realistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,
just image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel
about a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced
a 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric 
aristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already
dropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment
to travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,
his ancestral mansion, to write about the return 
of the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries
pardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story 
of the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against 
the conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling
the story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous 
invasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism
the Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812
without talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of
the threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at 
the Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives 
that inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,
the class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority 
of the Russian population, who were peasants,
or even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners
of the land on which they lived. "War and Peace" opens on the eve
of war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret
about the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things
aristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces 
between the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters
in "War and Peace." Instead, readers enter
a vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless 
and illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive
the battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl
falling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle
with all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors
plays a background part. But while the characters 
and their psychologies are gripping, Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt 
the narrative to pose insightful 
questions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions
of so-called great men like Napoleon, or are there larger cultural and economic
forces at play? These extended digressions are part 
of what make "War and Peace" so panoramic in scope. But for some 19th century critics, this meant "War and Peace" barely felt
like a novel at all. It was a "large, loose, baggy monster,"
in the words of Henry James. Tolstoy, in fact, agreed. To him, novels were 
a western European form. Russian writers had to write differently
because Russian people lived differently. "What is 'War and Peace'?" he asked. "It is not a novel. Still less an epic poem. Still less a historical chronicle. 'War and Peace' is what the author wanted
and was able to express in the form in which it was expressed." It is, in other words, the sum total
of Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less. By the time "War and Peace" ends, Tolstoy has brought his characters
to the year 1820, 36 years before the events he originally
hoped to write about. In trying to understand his own times, he had become immersed in the years
piled up behind him. The result is a grand interrogation
into history, culture, philosophy, psychology, and the human response to war.

**Transcript**:
The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered "duck vagina,"
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5, but it is about black widow spiders. However, Question 7 is about bed bugs and has a similar content and intent to the ground truth MCQ, but it is asking about the countermeasure of the female bed bugs. 

However, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if we have to choose one, it would be Question 5, but for a different insect.

However, since it is not a perfect match, I will try to look at it from a different perspective.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 3 mentions a "syringe-like structure for injecting sperm" in one of its options (Option C). This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which mentions that male bedbugs fertilize females by piercing the skin of her abdomen with a syringe-like penis.

However, Question 3 is asking about a different insect and a different feature of their genitalia. But if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 3's Option C.

But since this is still not a perfect match, I will try to look at it from another perspective.

From the perspective of the content and the intent of the question, I can see that Question 5 and Question 7 are the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, they are asking about different aspects of the genitalia and different insects.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the bed bug's syringe-like penis in the following sentence:

"bed bug males bypass a female's genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject sperm cells directly into her belly."

This sentence is similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs exactly match this sentence.

In this case, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one of the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but it's still not a perfect match.

However, I must provide an answer. In this case, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

**Transcript**:
The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered "duck vagina,"
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.

**Transcript**:
How did Dracula become
the world's most famous vampire? More than 100 years after
his creator was laid to rest, Dracula lives on as the most famous
vampire in history. But this Transylvanian noble, neither the first fictional vampire
nor the most popular of his time, may have remained buried
in obscurity if not for a twist of fate. Dracula's first appearance was in
Bram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same name. But that was far from the beginning
of vampire myths. Blood-sucking monsters had already been
part of folklore for at least 800 years. It was Slavic folklore that gave us
the word vampire, or "upir" in Old Russian. The term's first known written mention
comes from the 11th century. Vampire lore in the region predated
Christianity's arrival and persisted despite the church's efforts
to eliminate pagan beliefs. Stories of vampires originated from
misinterpretations of diseases, such as rabies, and pellagra, and decomposition. In the case of the latter, gasses swelling
the body and blood oozing from the mouth could make a corpse look like
it had recently been alive and feeding. Vampires were describe as bloated
with overgrown teeth and nails. This gave rise to many rituals
intended to prevent the dead from rising, such as burying bodies with garlic
or poppyseeds, as well as having them staked, burned, or mutilated. Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon
until the 18th century when Serbia was caught in the struggle
between two great powers, the Habsburg Monarchy and Ottoman Empire. Austrian soldiers and government officials
observed and documented the strange local burial rituals, and their reports 
became widely publicized. The resulting vampire hysteria
got so out of hand that in 1755, the Austrian Empress was forced 
to dispatch her personal physician. He investigated and put an end
to the rumors by publishing a thorough, 
scientific refutation. The panic subsided, but the vampire
had already taken root in Western Europe's imagination, spawning works like "The Vampyre" in 1819, and Joseph Sheridan
Le Fanu's "Carmilla" in 1872. This book would greatly influence a young
Irish drama critic named Bram Stoker. Stoker, who was born in Dublin in 1847, was famously bedridden with an unknown
illness until the age of seven. During that time, 
his mother told him folktales and true tales of horror, including her experiences during
an outbreak of cholera in 1832. There, she described victims buried alive
in mass graves. Later in his life, Stoker went on to write
fantasy, romance, adventure stories, and, in 1897, "Dracula." Although the book's main villain
and namesake is thought to be based on the historical
figure of Vlad III Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, the association is mostly just
that they share a name. Other elements and characters 
were inspired directly and indirectly by various works in the Victorian Era, such as "The Mysterious Stranger." The novel, upon release, was only
a moderate success in its day, nor was it even 
Stoker's most well-known work, mentioned only briefly in a 1912 obituary. But a critical copyright battle would
completely change Dracula's fate, and catapult the character
into literary renown. In 1922, a German studio adapted the novel
into the now classic silent film "Nosferatu" without paying royalties. Despite changes in character names
and minor plot points, the parallels were obvious,
and the studio was sued into bankruptcy. To prevent more plagiarism attempts, Stoker's widow decided
to establish copyright over the stage version of "Dracula" by approving a production 
by family-friend Hamilton Deane. Although Deane's adaptation made drastic
cuts to the story, it became a classic, thanks largely to Bela Lugosi's 
performance on Broadway. Lugosi would go on to star in
the 1931 film version by Universal, lending the character 
many of his signature characteristics. And since then, Dracula has risen again
in countless adaptations, finding eternal life far beyond
the humble pages of his birth.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I must note that Question 6 does not ask about the earliest known word for "vampire" from Eastern Europe, but rather about the origins of vampire myths. 

A more suitable question would be one that asks about the etymology or the earliest known term for "vampire". Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to be considered a match.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 8 is the closest in terms of discussing the historical context of vampire lore, although it does not specifically ask about the earliest known word for "vampire".

with overgrown teeth and nails. This gave rise to many rituals
intended to prevent the dead from rising, such as burying bodies with garlic
or poppyseeds, as well as having them staked, burned, or mutilated. Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon
until the 18th century when Serbia was caught in the struggle
between two great powers, the Habsburg Monarchy and Ottoman Empire. Austrian soldiers and government officials
observed and documented the strange local burial rituals, and their reports 
became widely publicized. The resulting vampire hysteria
got so out of hand that in 1755, the Austrian Empress was forced 
to dispatch her personal physician. He investigated and put an end
to the rumors by publishing a thorough, 
scientific refutation. The panic subsided, but the vampire
had already taken root in Western Europe's imagination, spawning works like "The Vampyre" in 1819, and Joseph Sheridan
Le Fanu's "Carmilla" in 1872. This book would greatly influence a young
Irish drama critic named Bram Stoker. Stoker, who was born in Dublin in 1847, was famously bedridden with an unknown
illness until the age of seven. During that time, 
his mother told him folktales and true tales of horror, including her experiences during
an outbreak of cholera in 1832. There, she described victims buried alive
in mass graves. Later in his life, Stoker went on to write
fantasy, romance, adventure stories, and, in 1897, "Dracula." Although the book's main villain
and namesake is thought to be based on the historical
figure of Vlad III Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, the association is mostly just
that they share a name. Other elements and characters 
were inspired directly and indirectly by various works in the Victorian Era, such as "The Mysterious Stranger." The novel, upon release, was only
a moderate success in its day, nor was it even 
Stoker's most well-known work, mentioned only briefly in a 1912 obituary. But a critical copyright battle would
completely change Dracula's fate, and catapult the character
into literary renown. In 1922, a German studio adapted the novel
into the now classic silent film "Nosferatu" without paying royalties. Despite changes in character names
and minor plot points, the parallels were obvious,
and the studio was sued into bankruptcy. To prevent more plagiarism attempts, Stoker's widow decided
to establish copyright over the stage version of "Dracula" by approving a production 
by family-friend Hamilton Deane. Although Deane's adaptation made drastic
cuts to the story, it became a classic, thanks largely to Bela Lugosi's 
performance on Broadway. Lugosi would go on to star in
the 1931 film version by Universal, lending the character 
many of his signature characteristics. And since then, Dracula has risen again
in countless adaptations, finding eternal life far beyond
the humble pages of his birth.

How did Dracula become
the world's most famous vampire? More than 100 years after
his creator was laid to rest, Dracula lives on as the most famous
vampire in history. But this Transylvanian noble, neither the first fictional vampire
nor the most popular of his time, may have remained buried
in obscurity if not for a twist of fate. Dracula's first appearance was in
Bram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same name. But that was far from the beginning
of vampire myths. Blood-sucking monsters had already been
part of folklore for at least 800 years. It was Slavic folklore that gave us
the word vampire, or "upir" in Old Russian. The term's first known written mention
comes from the 11th century. Vampire lore in the region predated
Christianity's arrival and persisted despite the church's efforts
to eliminate pagan beliefs. Stories of vampires originated from
misinterpretations of diseases, such as rabies, and pellagra, and decomposition. In the case of the latter, gasses swelling
the body and blood oozing from the mouth could make a corpse look like
it had recently been alive and feeding. Vampires were describe as bloated
with overgrown teeth and nails. This gave rise to many rituals
intended to prevent the dead from rising, such as burying bodies with garlic
or poppyseeds, as well as having them staked, burned, or mutilated. Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1 is not the most similar, as it asks about the title of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel.**

**Question 3 is not the most similar, as it asks about the influence of Vlad III Dracula on Bram Stoker's creation of the character Dracula.**

**Question 9 is the most similar, as it asks about the factors that contributed to Bram Stoker's creation of the character Dracula, including his childhood experiences and the stories his mother told him. However, it does not specifically mention the Gothic novella "Carmilla" as an influence.**

However, among the provided options, **Question 9** is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

But since question 9 does not mention "Carmilla", we will look for the next best alternative.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly mention the influence of "Carmilla" on Bram Stoker's work. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, we can infer that the influence of other works, such as "Carmilla", is related to the broader context of the development of vampire fiction and its impact on Stoker's writing.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ, although not a perfect match, is:

**None of the questions is a perfect match, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of intent.**

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not directly address the influence of "Carmilla" on Bram Stoker's work, which is the specific focus of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **9**, with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
The secrets of the X chromosome. These women are identical twins. They have the same nose, the same hair color, the same eye color. But this one is color blind
for green light, and this one isn't. How is that possible? The answer lies in their genes. For humans, the genetic information
that determines our physical traits is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes
in the nucleus of every cell. These chromosomes are made up of proteins
and long, coiled strands of DNA. Segments of DNA, called genes,
tell the cell to build specific proteins, which control its identity and function. For every chromosome pair,
one comes from each biological parent. In 22 of these pairs, the chromosomes
contain the same set of genes, but may have different versions
of those genes. The differences arrive from mutations, which are changes to the genetic sequence that may have occurred 
many generations ago. Some of those changes have no effect, some cause diseases, and some lead to advantageous adaptations. The result of having two versions
of each gene is that you display a combination
of your biological parents' traits. But the 23rd pair is unique, and that's the secret behind
the one color blind twin. This pair, called the X and Y chromosomes,
influences your biological sex. Most women have two X chromosomes while most men have one X and one Y. The Y chromosome contains genes
for male development and fertility. The X chromosome, on the other hand, contains important genes for things other
than sex determination or reproduction, like nervous system development, skeletal muscle function, and the receptors in the eyes
that detect green light. Biological males with 
an XY chromosome pair only get one copy of all these
X chromosome genes, so the human body has evolved
to function without duplicates. But that creates a problem
for people with two X chromosomes. If both X chromosomes produced proteins,
as is normal in other chromosomes, development of the embryo would be
completely impaired. The solution is X inactivation. This happens early in development
when an embryo with two X chromosomes is just a ball of cells. Each cell inactivates one X chromosome. There's a certain degree of randomness
to this process. One cell may inactivate the X chromosome
from one parent, and another the chromosome
from the other parent. The inactive X shrivels into a clump
called a Barr body and goes silent. Almost none of its genes
order proteins to be made. When these early cells divide,
each passes on its X inactivation. So some clusters of cells
express the maternal X chromosome, while others express the paternal X. If these chromosomes
carry different traits, those differences 
will show up in the cells. This is why calico cats have patches. One X had a gene for orange fur
and the other had a gene for black fur. The pattern of the coat reveals
which one stayed active where. Now we can explain our color blind twin. Both sisters inherited one mutant copy
of the green receptor gene and one normally functioning copy. The embryo split into twins
before X inactivation, so each twin ended up
with a different inactivation pattern. In one, the X chromosome
with the normal gene was turned off in the cells that eventually became eyes. Without those genetic instructions, she now can't sense green light
and is color blind. Disorders that are associated
with mutations of X chromosome genes, like color blindness, or hemophilia, are often less severe in individuals
with two X chromosomes. That's because in someone with one normal
and one mutant copy of the gene, only some of their cells would be
affected by the mutation. This severity of the disorder
depends on which X got turned off and where those cells were. On the other hand, all the cells in
someone with only one X chromosome can only express the mutant copy
of the gene if that's what they inherited. There are still unresolved questions
about X inactivation, like how some genes on the X chromosome
escape inactivation and why inactivation isn't always random. What we do know is that this mechanism is one of the many ways that genes
alone don't tell our whole story.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of chromosomes in each human cell, while the generated MCQs focus on the role of chromosomes and genes in determining physical traits, X inactivation, and other related topics.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1: "What primarily determines the physical traits of humans?" Options: A. Environmental factors and lifestyle, B. Chromosomes and genes, C. Hormones and nutrition, D. DNA replication and cell division. Correct Option: B.

Although this generated MCQ does not directly ask about the number of chromosomes, it does mention chromosomes and genes as the primary determinants of physical traits, which is related to the concept of chromosomes in the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of chromosomes in human cells.

**Transcript**:
The secrets of the X chromosome. These women are identical twins. They have the same nose, the same hair color, the same eye color. But this one is color blind
for green light, and this one isn't. How is that possible? The answer lies in their genes. For humans, the genetic information
that determines our physical traits is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes
in the nucleus of every cell. These chromosomes are made up of proteins
and long, coiled strands of DNA. Segments of DNA, called genes,
tell the cell to build specific proteins, which control its identity and function. For every chromosome pair,
one comes from each biological parent. In 22 of these pairs, the chromosomes
contain the same set of genes, but may have different versions
of those genes. The differences arrive from mutations, which are changes to the genetic sequence that may have occurred 
many generations ago. Some of those changes have no effect, some cause diseases, and some lead to advantageous adaptations. The result of having two versions
of each gene is that you display a combination
of your biological parents' traits. But the 23rd pair is unique, and that's the secret behind
the one color blind twin. This pair, called the X and Y chromosomes,
influences your biological sex. Most women have two X chromosomes while most men have one X and one Y. The Y chromosome contains genes
for male development and fertility. The X chromosome, on the other hand, contains important genes for things other
than sex determination or reproduction, like nervous system development, skeletal muscle function, and the receptors in the eyes
that detect green light. Biological males with 
an XY chromosome pair only get one copy of all these
X chromosome genes, so the human body has evolved
to function without duplicates. But that creates a problem
for people with two X chromosomes. If both X chromosomes produced proteins,
as is normal in other chromosomes, development of the embryo would be
completely impaired. The solution is X inactivation. This happens early in development
when an embryo with two X chromosomes is just a ball of cells. Each cell inactivates one X chromosome. There's a certain degree of randomness
to this process. One cell may inactivate the X chromosome
from one parent, and another the chromosome
from the other parent. The inactive X shrivels into a clump
called a Barr body and goes silent. Almost none of its genes
order proteins to be made. When these early cells divide,
each passes on its X inactivation. So some clusters of cells
express the maternal X chromosome, while others express the paternal X. If these chromosomes
carry different traits, those differences 
will show up in the cells. This is why calico cats have patches. One X had a gene for orange fur
and the other had a gene for black fur. The pattern of the coat reveals
which one stayed active where. Now we can explain our color blind twin. Both sisters inherited one mutant copy
of the green receptor gene and one normally functioning copy. The embryo split into twins
before X inactivation, so each twin ended up
with a different inactivation pattern. In one, the X chromosome
with the normal gene was turned off in the cells that eventually became eyes. Without those genetic instructions, she now can't sense green light
and is color blind. Disorders that are associated
with mutations of X chromosome genes, like color blindness, or hemophilia, are often less severe in individuals
with two X chromosomes. That's because in someone with one normal
and one mutant copy of the gene, only some of their cells would be
affected by the mutation. This severity of the disorder
depends on which X got turned off and where those cells were. On the other hand, all the cells in
someone with only one X chromosome can only express the mutant copy
of the gene if that's what they inherited. There are still unresolved questions
about X inactivation, like how some genes on the X chromosome
escape inactivation and why inactivation isn't always random. What we do know is that this mechanism is one of the many ways that genes
alone don't tell our whole story.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the result of X inactivation in cells with two X chromosomes. The correct option, B, states that "One X chromosome is inactivated, and the other produces proteins," which aligns with the ground truth MCQ's correct option A, "Be passed on to other cells during cell division." Although the wording is not identical, the underlying concept is the same, as the inactivated X chromosome is indeed passed on to other cells during cell division.

**Transcript**:
What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the size of a kangaroo's offspring at birth, while the generated MCQs do not have a direct match. However, Question 6 mentions the quoll, which is the smallest marsupial, and it provides some information about the size of marsupial babies.

Although it's not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it talks about marsupials and their characteristics. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 6

**Transcript**:
What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.

**Transcript**:
You're standing at 
the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch
on the back of your head. We've all experienced the annoyance 
of an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why
we itch in the first place? The average person experiences
dozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts
of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. And then there are the mysterious ones
that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching. You're scratching your head right now,
aren't you? Anyhow, let's take one of the most
common sources: bug bites. When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body
called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting. That compound, 
which we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes 
our capillaries swell. This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates 
the body's immune response to this perceived threat. That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen
can make your eyes puff up. Histamine also activates the nerves
involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch. But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood. In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying 
the mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have discovered that
itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of
the nerves that are associated with pain. These dedicated nerves produce a molecule
called natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried
up the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch. When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal
that overrides the itching sensation. It's almost like a distraction,
which creates the sensation of relief. But is there actually an evolutionary
purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us? The leading theory is that our skin
has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks
from the outside world. Think about it. Our automatic scratching response
would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant. This might explain why we don't
feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how 
maddening that would be. In some people, glitches in the pathways
responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching
that can actually harm their health. One extreme example is a psychological
condition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies
are infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly. Another phenomenon 
called phantom itching can occur in patients 
who've had amputations. Because this injury has 
so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal 
nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs
that are no longer there. Doctors are now finding ways
to treat these itching anomalies. In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect
the remaining limb, which the patient scratches. That creates an illusion 
that tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary 
itch has been satisfied. Oddly enough, that actually works. Researchers are also searching
for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try
and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases. If having an unscratchable itch
feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed. The Italian poet wrote about
a section of hell where people were punished by being
left in pits to itch for all eternity.

the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch
on the back of your head. We've all experienced the annoyance 
of an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why
we itch in the first place? The average person experiences
dozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts
of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. And then there are the mysterious ones
that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching. You're scratching your head right now,
aren't you? Anyhow, let's take one of the most
common sources: bug bites. When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body
called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting. That compound, 
which we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes 
our capillaries swell. This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates 
the body's immune response to this perceived threat. That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen
can make your eyes puff up. Histamine also activates the nerves
involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch. But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood. In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying 
the mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have discovered that
itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of
the nerves that are associated with pain. These dedicated nerves produce a molecule
called natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried
up the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch. When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal
that overrides the itching sensation. It's almost like a distraction,
which creates the sensation of relief. But is there actually an evolutionary
purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us? The leading theory is that our skin
has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks
from the outside world. Think about it. Our automatic scratching response
would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant. This might explain why we don't
feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how 
maddening that would be. In some people, glitches in the pathways
responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching
that can actually harm their health. One extreme example is a psychological
condition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies
are infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly. Another phenomenon 
called phantom itching can occur in patients 
who've had amputations. Because this injury has 
so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal 
nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs
that are no longer there. Doctors are now finding ways
to treat these itching anomalies. In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect
the remaining limb, which the patient scratches. That creates an illusion 
that tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary 
itch has been satisfied. Oddly enough, that actually works. Researchers are also searching
for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try
and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases. If having an unscratchable itch
feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed. The Italian poet wrote about
a section of hell where people were punished by being
left in pits to itch for all eternity.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: Which molecule triggers a signal that's carried up the spinal cord to the brain, creating the feeling of an itch? Options: A. Histamine, B. Anticoagulant, C. Natriuretic polypetide B, D. Dopamine Correct Option: C.

However, the ground truth MCQ is asking about the association of nerve cells that transmit itch signals with other sensations. A more relevant generated MCQ is not available, but Question 6 is related to the topic of itch signals. A better match would be a question that directly asks about the association of nerve cells with pain, which is not available among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would choose Question 6 (index 6), but keep in mind that it's not a perfect match.

However, since Question 6 does not directly answer the Ground Truth MCQ, another approach is to look at the content of the transcript. In the transcript, it is mentioned that "Researchers have discovered that itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of the nerves that are associated with pain." Based on this information, a generated MCQ that directly asks about this topic is not available, but Question 7 mentions the relationship between pain and itching sensations. 

Considering this, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 7 (index 7), as it is related to the topic of pain and itching sensations, although it does not directly ask about the association of nerve cells with pain.

However, if the most important thing is the relationship between itch and pain, the best match is actually Question 7, but in terms of the type of question (nerve cells associated with), none of the generated MCQs match the Ground Truth MCQ perfectly.

But based on the intent of the question, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match (index 7).

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the year Cassini launched, while the generated MCQs do not directly address this question. However, Question 7: "How long did it take the Cassini spacecraft to travel from Earth to Saturn?" is related to the timeline of the Cassini mission.

Assuming that the travel time is related to the launch year, I would suggest Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7

Please note that this is an indirect match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the launch year of Cassini.

**Transcript**:
For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years, while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated, but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results 
in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process
different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters. In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity. When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies
and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times
during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells
respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies
in longevity. So it's the combination 
of all these factors playing out to differing degrees
in different animals that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure
and nutrition. This, and other increases 
in life expectancy make us possibly the only species
on Earth to take control over our natural fate.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the question phrasing is different, the content and intent of Question 2 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks which factor does not contribute to aging, and the correct answer is "Faster tissue regeneration." Question 2 asks about the primary cause of aging, and the correct answer is "Cell death and dysfunction." 

However, if we look at the options provided for Question 2, option A ("Cell growth and regeneration") is similar in concept to the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ ("Faster tissue regeneration"). Both imply a positive or beneficial process that would not contribute to aging.

While there isn't a direct match between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years, while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated, but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results 
in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process
different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters. In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity. When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies
and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times
during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells
respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies
in longevity. So it's the combination 
of all these factors playing out to differing degrees
in different animals that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure
and nutrition. This, and other increases 
in life expectancy make us possibly the only species
on Earth to take control over our natural fate.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 5 does discuss a related topic of small animals like mice developing an evolutionary defense mechanism to cope with their shorter lifespan.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the factor contributing to the short lifespan of roundworms. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 3, which discusses the relationship between body size and lifespan. While it does not specifically address roundworms, it does mention that smaller species (like worms and flies) are limited by the mechanics of their cell division, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

But since it's not a perfect match, I'll also provide an alternative answer. 

Alternative Answer: Question 3.

However, I must note that there's another generated MCQ that is more relevant than Question 3.

The transcript mentions: "Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly."

Based on this information, I realized that I made an error in my previous response. The correct answer should be the generated MCQ that discusses the topic of cell division in small animals like worms.

Unfortunately, such a generated MCQ does not exist among the provided options, but Question 2 does discuss cell death and dysfunction as the primary cause of aging. 

So, taking this into consideration, I'll provide another answer.

Alternative Answer: Question 2.

However, I must note that the best match would be a generated MCQ that specifically addresses the topic of cell division in small animals like worms, which is not available among the provided options.

After re-reading the generated MCQs, I realized that I missed something. Question 1 does discuss the lifespan of the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans, but it does not address the factor contributing to its short lifespan.

However, I noticed that the ground truth MCQ asks about the factor contributing to the short lifespan of roundworms, and the transcript mentions that some small animals, like worms, are limited by the mechanics of their cell division.

With this information in mind, I'll provide another answer.

Since a generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ is not available, I will choose a generated MCQ that discusses a related topic.

Alternative Answer: Question 1.

However, I must note that the best match would be a generated MCQ that specifically addresses the topic of cell division in small animals like worms, which is not available among the provided options.

Let's re-evaluate the generated MCQs again.

Upon re-evaluation, I realized that I made another error. The correct answer is not among the previously mentioned alternatives.

The correct answer is actually not available among the provided generated MCQs, as none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I must provide an answer.

In this case, I will choose the generated MCQ that discusses the primary cause of aging, which is related to the topic of cell death and dysfunction.

So, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Answer: Question 2

The stereotype that men are smarter than women has a long history, but in the battle of the sexes, who actually has the superior intellect when it comes down to it? Are boys smarter than girls? Early studies show that male brains are 8 to 13 percent larger in volume than female brains, however this has been since attributed to differences in body size. Women's brains have more gyrofication or brain folding, and as a result, a greater cortical surface area. Besides, bigger isn't always better. Sperm whales, elephants and dolphins all have larger brains than humans, and while they are smart, their cognitive abilities are less than our own. There are other structural differences, though, like males having more connections within hemispheres, while women have more connections between hemispheres. But overall, MRI brain imaging shows significant overlap in the physical structure between the sexes. After studying 14 hundred brains and comparing the sexes, researchers found that mostly all men and woman show a mosaic of female and male typical structures in the brain. This study also evaluted gender stereotypical behaviours. Like how video games are often considered male behaviour while scrapbooking is female and the results found that 0.1% of test subjects displayed only male or only female typical behaviours. Tests on intelligence find similar results with major IQ studies showing neglible, or no sex differences in general intelligence but do show women having stronger verbal abilities while men show stronger visual-spatial abilities. Interestingly, studies show more male variance in tests with their scores being both the worst and the best. One meta analysis of 22 studies did fiund men to be 3.3 to 5.5 IQ points above women but this study has been called into question by academics who found the methodology flawed. In academic performance of language, math and science, women consistently received better grade in 70% of nations. But on SAT testing in the U.S. men scored 33 points higher in math and science. Other tests like the Program for International Student Assessment showed both sexes performing equally in several countries with girls performing better in some like Iceland suggesting cultural and environmental differences and not necessarily biological differences at play. But research has found that stereotypes about womens performance actually impact how well they do. When told that a particular math test had significant gender differences, women performed significantly worse than their male peers. While women who were told there was no difference, scored the same. This phenomenom is known as the stereotype threat. Even google search data shows that parents 2.5 times more likely to search is my son gifted than is my daughter gifted? Despite 11% more girls in gifted programs in America. And girls pick up on these bias as early as 6 years old. When told a story at age 5 about a person who is really really smart both boys and girls associate intelligence with there own gender but by age 6 both girls and boys picked a male character as the smartest. In a similar experiment kids were asked if they wanted to play a game for people who are really really smart and again at age 5 both sexes wanted to play but by age 6, girls had decided these games weren't for them. and though women do strive to work in STEM fields studies show they face barriers. In a double blind study science faculty from research universities rated applications for a lab manager position. What they didn't know is that the applications were randomly assigned either male or female names. As a result, faculty perceived the male applicant names to be significantly more competent, hireable and deserving of mentoring even though the applications with female names were identical. Males were also offered higher starting salaries, an average of 30,000 versus the females 26,000. Though these studies produce a sobering reality research does point to growing equality between the sexes with passing decades and education and in spite of these barriers women continue to contribute to our collective scientific knowledge. Rosalind Franklin allowed us to understand our own DNA, Katherine Johnson helped Apollo 11 land on the moon and this year Maryam Mirzakhani is the first women to win a Nobel prize for mathematics. Fellow mathematician Izabella Laba said "Mirzakhan's selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing mathematical research at the same level of men. I have never had any doubt about that in the first place.. What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of reconizing excellence in women's work." To learn more we asked the women at ASAP Science to speak personally about their experiences growing up and give insight about how they navigate the societal pressures of being a woman.

**Transcript**:
Your research team has found
a prehistoric virus preserved in the permafrost and isolated it for study. After a late night working, you're just closing up the lab
when a sudden earthquake hits and knocks out the power. As the emergency generators kick in,
an alarm confirms your worst fears: all the sample vials have broken. The virus is contained for now, but unless you can destroy it, the vents will soon open
and unleash a deadly airborne plague. Without hesitation, you grab
your HazMat suit and get ready to save the world. The lab is a four by four compound
of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner
and an exit at the southeast. Each room is connected to the adjacent
ones by an airlock, and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance. To destroy it, you must enter each
contaminated room and pull its emergency 
self-destruct switch. But there's a catch. Because the security system 
is on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without 
activating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go 
back in to that room. You start to draw out possible
routes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you
to the exit without missing at least one room. So how can you destroy the virus
in every contaminated room and survive to tell the story? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph
your possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea. This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish 
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. The challenge 
of the path problem is to find whether a given graph
has a Hamiltonian path. That's a route that visits 
every point within it exactly once. This type of problem, classified 
as NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph
is sufficiently large. Although any proposed solution
can be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one, or determining that one exists. And we're not even sure
if it's possible for computers to reliably find 
such solutions, either. This puzzle adds a twist
to the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start 
and end at specific points. But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true
Hamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points. That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side. In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and 
ends in opposite corners is impossible. Here's one way of understanding why. Consider a checkerboard grid with
an even number of squares on each side. Every path through it will alternate
black and white. These grids will all also have an even
total number of squares because an even number times
and even number is even. So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white. And one that starts on white
will have to end on black. However, in any grid with even
numbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully
and notice an important exception. It's true that once you activate
the switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back. But there's one room 
that wasn't contaminated - the entrance. This means that you can leave it once
without pulling the switch and return there when you've
destroyed either of these two rooms. The corner room may have
been contaminated from the airlock opening,
but that's okay because you can destroy the entrance
after your second visit. That return trip gives you four options
for a successful route, and a similar set of options if you
destroyed this room first. Congratulations. You've prevented
an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode,
you need a break. Maybe you should take up that recent
job offer to become a traveling salesman.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, it's essential to note that Question 7 does not ask about passing through every room exactly once, but rather about the number of options for a successful route after destroying one of the two rooms adjacent to the entrance and returning to the entrance.

A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the possibility of passing through every room exactly once, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 3 is also related to the ground truth MCQ, as it explains why it's impossible to start and end a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners of a grid with an even number of rooms on each side.

Considering the options provided, I would recommend:
 Question 3 or Question 7 

However, if I must pick only one index:
 Question 3

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the action that must be taken once a contaminated room is entered. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which asks about the exception to the rule that once a contaminated room's switch is activated, it's destroyed and you can never go back. Although the question intent is not identical, both MCQs are related to the rules of navigating contaminated rooms.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question intent, I would suggest that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 6 is the closest, as it is related to the consequences of not taking a specific action in the contaminated rooms, but it is still not a good match.

But since Question 4 is the closest in terms of the topic of contaminated rooms, I will choose it as the most similar.

numbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully
and notice an important exception. It's true that once you activate
the switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back. But there's one room 
that wasn't contaminated - the entrance. This means that you can leave it once
without pulling the switch and return there when you've
destroyed either of these two rooms. The corner room may have
been contaminated from the airlock opening,
but that's okay because you can destroy the entrance
after your second visit. That return trip gives you four options
for a successful route, and a similar set of options if you
destroyed this room first. Congratulations. You've prevented
an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode,
you need a break. Maybe you should take up that recent

**Transcript**:
Your research team has found
a prehistoric virus preserved in the permafrost and isolated it for study. After a late night working, you're just closing up the lab
when a sudden earthquake hits and knocks out the power. As the emergency generators kick in,
an alarm confirms your worst fears: all the sample vials have broken. The virus is contained for now, but unless you can destroy it, the vents will soon open
and unleash a deadly airborne plague. Without hesitation, you grab
your HazMat suit and get ready to save the world. The lab is a four by four compound
of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner
and an exit at the southeast. Each room is connected to the adjacent
ones by an airlock, and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance. To destroy it, you must enter each
contaminated room and pull its emergency 
self-destruct switch. But there's a catch. Because the security system 
is on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without 
activating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go 
back in to that room. You start to draw out possible
routes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you
to the exit without missing at least one room. So how can you destroy the virus
in every contaminated room and survive to tell the story? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph
your possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea. This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish 
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. The challenge 
of the path problem is to find whether a given graph
has a Hamiltonian path. That's a route that visits 
every point within it exactly once. This type of problem, classified 
as NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph
is sufficiently large. Although any proposed solution
can be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one, or determining that one exists. And we're not even sure
if it's possible for computers to reliably find 
such solutions, either. This puzzle adds a twist
to the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start 
and end at specific points. But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true
Hamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points. That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side. In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and 
ends in opposite corners is impossible. Here's one way of understanding why. Consider a checkerboard grid with
an even number of squares on each side. Every path through it will alternate
black and white. These grids will all also have an even
total number of squares because an even number times
and even number is even. So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white. And one that starts on white
will have to end on black. However, in any grid with even
numbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is the exception to the rule that once you activate the switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the location of the virus and the rules of the puzzle. However, it's not an exact match.

A closer match is not available, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar.

However, I can suggest a better match if I were to rephrase the generated MCQs:

A possible match could be a generated MCQ that asks: "In which room was the virus not released?" with the same options as the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, this exact match is not available among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is:

**4**

Please note that this is not an exact match, but rather the closest available option.

**Transcript**:
On September 6, 1522, the "Victoria" sailed into harbor
in southern Spain. The battered vessel and its 18
sailors were all that remained of a fleet that had departed
three years before. Yet her voyage was considered a success for the "Victoria" had achieved
something unprecedented: the first circumnavigation
of the globe. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage
on behalf of Spain. Columbus's discovery had prompted
the Catholic Spanish rulers to turn to the Pope to preempt
any claims by Portugal to the new lands. The Pope resolved this dispute by drawing
an imaginary line on the world map. Spain had the right to claim territories
west of the divide, and Portugal to the east. Spain and Portugal, the two major
seafaring super powers at the time, agreed to these terms in what came
to be called the Treaty of Tordesillas. At the time, these nations had their
eyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands
in today's Indonesia. The spices found there, which were used as seasonings, food preservatives, and aphrodisiacs, were worth many times 
their weight in gold. But because of Portugal's control
over eastern sea routes, Spain's only viable option
was to sail west. So when a Portuguese defector
named Ferdinand Magellan claimed that a westward route
to the Spice Islands existed, King Charles made him captain
of a Spanish armada, and gave him all the resources 
he would need. Along with a share 
in the voyage's profits, he granted Magellan five ships
and about 260 men. The crew included a young slave
named Enrique, captured by Magellan on a previous
journey to Malacca, and Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian nobleman seeking adventure. On September 20, 1519, 
the fleet weighed anchor and headed southwest. After making landfall 
in what is now Brazil, it proceeded along the coast,
exploring any water way leading inland. They were looking for the fabled passage
linking east and west. As the weather worsened, the Spaniards resentment
at having a Portuguese captain escalated. A full-blown mutiny soon erupted, which Magellan crushed 
with unspeakable cruelty. But his problems were only just beginning. During a reconnaissance mission, 
the "Santiago" was wrecked by a storm. Then while exploring a narrow waterway, the captain of the "San Antonio" took
the first opportunity to slip away and sail back home. Magellan pressed forward, and on October 21, he started exploring
a navigable sea way. 27 freezing days later, the three remaining ships emerged
from what we now call the Strait of Magellan
into the Mar Pacifico. The fleet never expected the new ocean
to be so vast. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors
had succumbed to scurvy and famine. When they finally reached land again, Enrique, the young slave, proved
able to communicate with the natives. Their goal couldn't be far. Sailing further west, Magellan was warmly
received by Rajah Humabon of Cebu. So when the ruler asked him to help subdue and convert 
the rebellious chief of Mactan, the captain readily agreed. The adventure would be his last. Overconfident and severely outnumbered,
Magellan's force was overwhelmed, and the native's bamboo spears
ended the captain's life. Yet the voyage had to continue. Magellan's will specified that Enrique
should be freed, but the expedition still needed
an interpreter. With his freedom at stake, Enrique is believed to have plotted
with the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed
at a feast on the beach. Enrique was never heard from again, but if he ever made it back to Malacca, he may have been the first person
to actually circumnavigate the globe. Meanwhile, the survivors 
burned the Concepcion and proceeded onward. They finally reached the Spice Islands
in November of 1521 and loaded up on precious cargo. But they still had to return to Spain. The "Trinidad" sank shortly after being
captured by the Portuguese. The "Victoria" continued west,
piloted by Juan Sebastián Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. Against all odds, the small vessel
made it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition
and turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands
and people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled 
the world's first phrase book of native languages. His journal is the reason we can
tell this story. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs
named after him. Elcano, too, was celebrated in Spain with a coat of arms and his face
on currency and stamps. United by fate, the survivors and the hundreds 
who sacrificed their lives challenged conventional wisdom and completed a historic journey
once thought impossible.

something unprecedented: the first circumnavigation
of the globe. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage
on behalf of Spain. Columbus's discovery had prompted
the Catholic Spanish rulers to turn to the Pope to preempt
any claims by Portugal to the new lands. The Pope resolved this dispute by drawing
an imaginary line on the world map. Spain had the right to claim territories
west of the divide, and Portugal to the east. Spain and Portugal, the two major
seafaring super powers at the time, agreed to these terms in what came
to be called the Treaty of Tordesillas. At the time, these nations had their
eyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands
in today's Indonesia. The spices found there, which were used as seasonings, food preservatives, and aphrodisiacs, were worth many times 
their weight in gold. But because of Portugal's control
over eastern sea routes, Spain's only viable option
was to sail west. So when a Portuguese defector
named Ferdinand Magellan claimed that a westward route
to the Spice Islands existed, King Charles made him captain
of a Spanish armada, and gave him all the resources 
he would need. Along with a share 
in the voyage's profits, he granted Magellan five ships
and about 260 men. The crew included a young slave
named Enrique, captured by Magellan on a previous
journey to Malacca, and Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian nobleman seeking adventure. On September 20, 1519, 
the fleet weighed anchor and headed southwest. After making landfall 
in what is now Brazil, it proceeded along the coast,
exploring any water way leading inland. They were looking for the fabled passage
linking east and west. As the weather worsened, the Spaniards resentment
at having a Portuguese captain escalated. A full-blown mutiny soon erupted, which Magellan crushed 
with unspeakable cruelty. But his problems were only just beginning. During a reconnaissance mission, 
the "Santiago" was wrecked by a storm. Then while exploring a narrow waterway, the captain of the "San Antonio" took
the first opportunity to slip away and sail back home. Magellan pressed forward, and on October 21, he started exploring
a navigable sea way. 27 freezing days later, the three remaining ships emerged
from what we now call the Strait of Magellan
into the Mar Pacifico. The fleet never expected the new ocean
to be so vast. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors
had succumbed to scurvy and famine. When they finally reached land again, Enrique, the young slave, proved
able to communicate with the natives. Their goal couldn't be far. Sailing further west, Magellan was warmly
received by Rajah Humabon of Cebu. So when the ruler asked him to help subdue and convert 
the rebellious chief of Mactan, the captain readily agreed. The adventure would be his last. Overconfident and severely outnumbered,
Magellan's force was overwhelmed, and the native's bamboo spears
ended the captain's life. Yet the voyage had to continue. Magellan's will specified that Enrique
should be freed, but the expedition still needed
an interpreter. With his freedom at stake, Enrique is believed to have plotted
with the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed
at a feast on the beach. Enrique was never heard from again, but if he ever made it back to Malacca, he may have been the first person
to actually circumnavigate the globe. Meanwhile, the survivors 
burned the Concepcion and proceeded onward. They finally reached the Spice Islands
in November of 1521 and loaded up on precious cargo. But they still had to return to Spain. The "Trinidad" sank shortly after being
captured by the Portuguese. The "Victoria" continued west,
piloted by Juan Sebastián Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. Against all odds, the small vessel
made it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition
and turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands
and people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled 
the world's first phrase book of native languages. His journal is the reason we can
tell this story. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs
named after him. Elcano, too, was celebrated in Spain with a coat of arms and his face
on currency and stamps. United by fate, the survivors and the hundreds 
who sacrificed their lives challenged conventional wisdom and completed a historic journey

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Who is believed to have plotted with the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed at a feast on the beach? Options: A. Enrique, the young slave, B. Magellan's loyalists, C. The native warriors, D. The Portuguese defectors Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only addresses one of the assertions (C) from the ground truth MCQ.

A closer match is not found among the generated MCQs, as none of them directly ask which assertion is false. But if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 7**

However, please note that this is not an exact match.

If I had to choose another question that is similar in terms of content, I would choose:

**Question 9: Who compiled the world's first phrase book of native languages during the voyage? Options: A. Magellan, B. Elcano, C. Pigafetta, D. Enrique Correct Option: C**

This question is related to assertion A in the ground truth MCQ, which mentions Antonio Pigafetta writing a detailed account of the voyage.

Again, please note that this is not an exact match.

In summary, while there is no exact match among the generated MCQs, I would choose **Question 7** as the closest match in terms of content and intent, and **Question 9** as another question that is similar in terms of content.

**Transcript**:
Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke
Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome. Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features 
looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly
stolen from a dream. Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces
accompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words
and vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from
the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle
over it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all
the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that
in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear
with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see. The letters are varied 
in style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique. The taller letters have been named
gallows characters. The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two
or more hands, with the painting done 
by yet another party. Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed
to hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money
off a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author
was a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken
but not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed. Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say. Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by 
the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand 
the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the
Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was
written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little
light on the mystery. The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have
traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague
to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code,
what might we find? The dream journal of 
a 15th-century illustrator? A bunch of nonsense? Or the lost knowledge 
of a forgotten culture? What do you think it is?

accompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words
and vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from
the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle
over it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all
the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that
in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear
with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see. The letters are varied 
in style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique. The taller letters have been named
gallows characters. The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two
or more hands, with the painting done 
by yet another party. Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed
to hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money
off a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author
was a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken
but not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed. Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say. Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by 
the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand 
the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the
Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was
written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little
light on the mystery. The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have
traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague
to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code,
what might we find? The dream journal of 
a 15th-century illustrator? A bunch of nonsense? Or the lost knowledge 
of a forgotten culture? What do you think it is?

**Transcript**:
What do fans of atmospheric 
post-punk music have in common with ancient barbarians? Not much. So why are both known as goths? Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection stretching 
across the centuries? The story begins in Ancient Rome. As the Roman Empire expanded,
it faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations 
along its borders. Among the most powerful were
a Germanic people known as Goths who were composed of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others
into the imperial army. As the Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played
larger roles in its defense and internal power struggles. In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt
lead by a soldier named Odoacer captured Rome 
and deposed the Western Emperor. Odoacer and his Ostrogoth
successor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern
Emperor's authority and maintained Roman traditions. But the Western Empire would never
be united again. Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms
ruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many of their names
still mark the map. This was the end of the Classical Period and the beginning of what many call
the Dark Ages. Although Roman culture was never
fully lost, its influence declined
and new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism
and allegory rather than proportion and realism. This shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey
of Saint Denis in France in 1137. Pointed arches, flying buttresses,
and large windows made the structure more skeletal
and ornate. That emphasized its open, 
luminous interior rather than the sturdy walls
and columns of Classical buildings. Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals
throughout Europe. But fashions change. With the Italian Renaissance's renewed
admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem
crude and inferior in comparison. Writing in his 1550 book, 
"Lives of the Artists," Giorgio Vasari was the first
to describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization. The name stuck, and soon came
to describe the Medieval period overall, with its associations of darkness,
superstition, and simplicity. But time marched on,
as did what was considered fashionable. In the 1700s, a period called
the Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason 
above all else. Reacting against that, Romantic authors
like Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past
of natural landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces. Here, the word Gothic 
was repurposed again to describe a literary genre that
emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism. The term was first applied 
by Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, 
"The Castle of Otranto" as a reference to the plot 
and general atmosphere. Many of the novel's elements became
genre staples inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature
and film until the 1970s when a new musical scene emerged. Taking cues from artists like
The Doors and The Velvet Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined gloomy lyrics 
and punk dissonance with imagery inspired 
by the Victorian era, classic horror, and androgynous glam fashion. By the early 1980s, similar bands
were consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it
out of dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV. And today, despite occasional negative
media attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as
a strong underground phenomenon. They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic metal, and even steampunk. The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years 
worth of countercultural movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires 
replacing solid columns to artists finding beauty in darkness. Each step has seen a revolution of sorts and a tendency for civilization to reach into
its past to reshape its present.

**Transcript**:
What do fans of atmospheric 
post-punk music have in common with ancient barbarians? Not much. So why are both known as goths? Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection stretching 
across the centuries? The story begins in Ancient Rome. As the Roman Empire expanded,
it faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations 
along its borders. Among the most powerful were
a Germanic people known as Goths who were composed of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others
into the imperial army. As the Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played
larger roles in its defense and internal power struggles. In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt
lead by a soldier named Odoacer captured Rome 
and deposed the Western Emperor. Odoacer and his Ostrogoth
successor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern
Emperor's authority and maintained Roman traditions. But the Western Empire would never
be united again. Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms
ruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many of their names
still mark the map. This was the end of the Classical Period and the beginning of what many call
the Dark Ages. Although Roman culture was never
fully lost, its influence declined
and new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism
and allegory rather than proportion and realism. This shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey
of Saint Denis in France in 1137. Pointed arches, flying buttresses,
and large windows made the structure more skeletal
and ornate. That emphasized its open, 
luminous interior rather than the sturdy walls
and columns of Classical buildings. Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals
throughout Europe. But fashions change. With the Italian Renaissance's renewed
admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem
crude and inferior in comparison. Writing in his 1550 book, 
"Lives of the Artists," Giorgio Vasari was the first
to describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization. The name stuck, and soon came
to describe the Medieval period overall, with its associations of darkness,
superstition, and simplicity. But time marched on,
as did what was considered fashionable. In the 1700s, a period called
the Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason 
above all else. Reacting against that, Romantic authors
like Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past
of natural landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces. Here, the word Gothic 
was repurposed again to describe a literary genre that
emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism. The term was first applied 
by Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, 
"The Castle of Otranto" as a reference to the plot 
and general atmosphere. Many of the novel's elements became
genre staples inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature
and film until the 1970s when a new musical scene emerged. Taking cues from artists like
The Doors and The Velvet Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined gloomy lyrics 
and punk dissonance with imagery inspired 
by the Victorian era, classic horror, and androgynous glam fashion. By the early 1980s, similar bands
were consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it
out of dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV. And today, despite occasional negative
media attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as
a strong underground phenomenon. They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic metal, and even steampunk. The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years 
worth of countercultural movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires 
replacing solid columns to artists finding beauty in darkness. Each step has seen a revolution of sorts and a tendency for civilization to reach into
its past to reshape its present.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever wondered what
happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it? Medicine that slides down
your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs
to go in the first place? The answer is that it hitches
a ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race
to do its job before it's snared by organs
and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts 
in your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet
for a sore ankle. Within minutes, the tablet starts
disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels
into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall
into a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood,
and anything in it, to the liver. The next step is to make 
it through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules
in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with 
the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules,
called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen
makes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it
into the circulatory blood stream. This blood loop travels through every
limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys,
and back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules 
encounter a location where the body's pain 
response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules
that are a part of that reaction. Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the
production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about
one or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently 
eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half
every two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach
from their targets, the systemic blood stream carries
them away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction
of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys
continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized
and filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for
any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes
it into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions 
on medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on 
a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, 
the medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug 
and its metabolites can be toxic. That's true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients
to get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine
changes quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes
that neutralize medication highly fluctuates 
during infancy and childhood. And that's just one 
of many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's
efficiency of processing medicine. Some day, routine DNA tests may be able
to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency
and other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor
or pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts
with the recommended timing.

and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts 
in your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet
for a sore ankle. Within minutes, the tablet starts
disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels
into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall
into a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood,
and anything in it, to the liver. The next step is to make 
it through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules
in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with 
the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules,
called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen
makes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it
into the circulatory blood stream. This blood loop travels through every
limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys,
and back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules 
encounter a location where the body's pain 
response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules
that are a part of that reaction. Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the
production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about
one or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently 
eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half
every two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach
from their targets, the systemic blood stream carries
them away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction
of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys
continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized
and filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for
any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes
it into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions 
on medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on 
a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, 
the medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug 
and its metabolites can be toxic. That's true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients
to get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine
changes quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes
that neutralize medication highly fluctuates 
during infancy and childhood. And that's just one 
of many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's
efficiency of processing medicine. Some day, routine DNA tests may be able
to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency
and other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor
or pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts
with the recommended timing.

Have you ever wondered what
happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it? Medicine that slides down
your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs

**Transcript**:
Today I’m going to tell you about one of
my favorite creatures to ever grace this planet. It’s a frog that’s pretty bizarre but
also weirdly sweet and adorable. Sadly, it went extinct just before I was born,
so I thought I’d never get the chance to see it. But a few years ago, scientists tried to bring
it back from the dead. I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Gastric-brooding frogs were first found in
Queensland, Australia in 1972. They looked pretty normal—just your average
brownish, greenish frog. But there was nothing average about how they
gave birth. A female frog would lay her eggs, and a male
frog would fertilize them externally. So far so normal. But then, the mother frog would swallow the
eggs—around 40 of them! You’d think this would be a terrible idea. After all, stomachs—whether they be frog
or human—usually contain strong acid to break down your last meal. But the eggs likely contained a chemical that
made the mother’s stomach stop producing acid. That meant the mother couldn’t eat during
her pregnancy, which from a human perspective seems awful, but the frogs seemed to make
do. Eventually, tadpoles would hatch from the
eggs. And the tadpoles would release mucus that
contained more of that acid-blocking chemical. The babies would continue to grow in the stomach
for another 6 weeks, getting so big that they’d compress the mother’s lungs. Luckily, these frogs could also breathe through
their skin, so the mothers didn’t suffocate. Finally, the tadpoles would metamorphose into
baby frogs, and the mother would vomit them up—usually one at a time over a few days. Though, when provoked some were known to projectile
vomit all their babies out at once. While barfing up your babies sounds...horrible...it’s
kinda sweet when you think about it. Gastric-brooding, as this strategy is called,
is a way to keep your babies close to you and safe while they’re most vulnerable. It’s really a lot like human pregnancy…only
the babies come out the other end… Anyway, there were two species of these frogs,
but both went extinct by the mid-80s. The culprit was likely an invasive fungus—one
that poses a major threat to amphibians worldwide, and that humans likely helped to spread around
the globe. It’s called chytrid fungus and it affects
a frog’s skin. Because frogs use their skin for crucial functions
like breathing, staying hydrated, and regulating their temperature, the parasite can easily
kill its victims. And it’s highly contagious—by 2013 it
had put 42% of the world’s frog species in danger. Losing all these frogs would be, in a word,
devastating. Not only would it have major impacts on ecosystems
worldwide, and be a loss of beautiful biodiversity, but there is so much we still have to learn
from these creatures that might be beneficial to human health and well-being. Take the gastric-brooding frog. If we’d had more time to study it, maybe
we could have learned more about how it turns off stomach acid production, potentially revealing
some insights that could help humans with GI problems. Consequently, back in 2013, some scientists
began a project to resurrect the gastric-brooding frog. They took cells from a frozen specimen, cloned
the DNA into the egg of another frog species, and ended up creating a living gastric-brooding
frog embryo. It only survived for about three days, but
they haven’t given up trying. And it’s made some researchers hopeful that
“de-extinction”—the process of bringing extinct species back to life—will one day
be a solution for reviving at least some of the valuable biodiversity we’ve lost, often
due to humans’ impact on the environment. Obviously, this is a controversial idea. And, I think most scientists would agree that
de-extinction is a last-gasp effort in conservation. It in no way means we should stop protecting
and preserving the at-risk species we have. That said, while I can’t speak to the ethics
of the situation, I will admit that there’s a pretty big part of me that would love to
see a gastric-brooding frog vomiting up its babies. Ew.

of the situation, I will admit that there’s a pretty big part of me that would love to
see a gastric-brooding frog vomiting up its babies. Ew.

**Transcript**:
There's a concept that's crucial
to chemistry and physics. It helps explain why physical processes
go one way and not the other: why ice melts, why cream spreads in coffee, why air leaks out of a punctured tire. It's entropy, and it's notoriously
difficult to wrap our heads around. Entropy is often described as
a measurement of disorder. That's a convenient image,
but it's unfortunately misleading. For example, which is more disordered - a cup of crushed ice or a glass
of room temperature water? Most people would say the ice, but that actually has lower entropy. So here's another way of thinking
about it through probability. This may be trickier to understand,
but take the time to internalize it and you'll have a much better 
understanding of entropy. Consider two small solids which are comprised 
of six atomic bonds each. In this model, the energy in each solid
is stored in the bonds. Those can be thought of 
as simple containers, which can hold indivisible units of energy
known as quanta. The more energy a solid has,
the hotter it is. It turns out that there are numerous
ways that the energy can be distributed in the two solids and still have the same 
total energy in each. Each of these options 
is called a microstate. For six quanta of energy in Solid A
and two in Solid B, there are 9,702 microstates. Of course, there are other ways our eight
quanta of energy can be arranged. For example, all of the energy
could be in Solid A and none in B, or half in A and half in B. If we assume that each microstate
is equally likely, we can see that some of the energy
configurations have a higher probability of occurring
than others. That's due to their greater number
of microstates. Entropy is a direct measure of each
energy configuration's probability. What we see is that the energy
configuration in which the energy
is most spread out between the solids has the highest entropy. So in a general sense, entropy can be thought of as a measurement
of this energy spread. Low entropy means 
the energy is concentrated. High entropy means it's spread out. To see why entropy is useful for
explaining spontaneous processes, like hot objects cooling down, we need to look at a dynamic system
where the energy moves. In reality, energy doesn't stay put. It continuously moves between 
neighboring bonds. As the energy moves, the energy configuration can change. Because of the distribution 
of microstates, there's a 21% chance that the system
will later be in the configuration in which the energy is maximally 
spread out, there's a 13% chance that it will
return to its starting point, and an 8% chance that A will actually
gain energy. Again, we see that because there are
more ways to have dispersed energy and high entropy than concentrated energy, the energy tends to spread out. That's why if you put a hot object
next to a cold one, the cold one will warm up
and the hot one will cool down. But even in that example, there is an 8% chance that the hot object
would get hotter. Why doesn't this ever happen
in real life? It's all about the size of the system. Our hypothetical solids only had
six bonds each. Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds
and 8,000 units of energy, and again start the system with
three-quarters of the energy in A and one-quarter in B. Now we find that chance of A
spontaneously acquiring more energy is this tiny number. Familiar, everyday objects have many, many
times more particles than this. The chance of a hot object 
in the real world getting hotter is so absurdly small, it just never happens. Ice melts, cream mixes in, and tires deflate because these states have more
dispersed energy than the originals. There's no mysterious force
nudging the system towards higher entropy. It's just that higher entropy is always
statistically more likely. That's why entropy has been called
time's arrow. If energy has the opportunity
to spread out, it will.

**Transcript**:
There's a concept that's crucial
to chemistry and physics. It helps explain why physical processes
go one way and not the other: why ice melts, why cream spreads in coffee, why air leaks out of a punctured tire. It's entropy, and it's notoriously
difficult to wrap our heads around. Entropy is often described as
a measurement of disorder. That's a convenient image,
but it's unfortunately misleading. For example, which is more disordered - a cup of crushed ice or a glass
of room temperature water? Most people would say the ice, but that actually has lower entropy. So here's another way of thinking
about it through probability. This may be trickier to understand,
but take the time to internalize it and you'll have a much better 
understanding of entropy. Consider two small solids which are comprised 
of six atomic bonds each. In this model, the energy in each solid
is stored in the bonds. Those can be thought of 
as simple containers, which can hold indivisible units of energy
known as quanta. The more energy a solid has,
the hotter it is. It turns out that there are numerous
ways that the energy can be distributed in the two solids and still have the same 
total energy in each. Each of these options 
is called a microstate. For six quanta of energy in Solid A
and two in Solid B, there are 9,702 microstates. Of course, there are other ways our eight
quanta of energy can be arranged. For example, all of the energy
could be in Solid A and none in B, or half in A and half in B. If we assume that each microstate
is equally likely, we can see that some of the energy
configurations have a higher probability of occurring
than others. That's due to their greater number
of microstates. Entropy is a direct measure of each
energy configuration's probability. What we see is that the energy
configuration in which the energy
is most spread out between the solids has the highest entropy. So in a general sense, entropy can be thought of as a measurement
of this energy spread. Low entropy means 
the energy is concentrated. High entropy means it's spread out. To see why entropy is useful for
explaining spontaneous processes, like hot objects cooling down, we need to look at a dynamic system
where the energy moves. In reality, energy doesn't stay put. It continuously moves between 
neighboring bonds. As the energy moves, the energy configuration can change. Because of the distribution 
of microstates, there's a 21% chance that the system
will later be in the configuration in which the energy is maximally 
spread out, there's a 13% chance that it will
return to its starting point, and an 8% chance that A will actually
gain energy. Again, we see that because there are
more ways to have dispersed energy and high entropy than concentrated energy, the energy tends to spread out. That's why if you put a hot object
next to a cold one, the cold one will warm up
and the hot one will cool down. But even in that example, there is an 8% chance that the hot object
would get hotter. Why doesn't this ever happen
in real life? It's all about the size of the system. Our hypothetical solids only had
six bonds each. Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds
and 8,000 units of energy, and again start the system with
three-quarters of the energy in A and one-quarter in B. Now we find that chance of A
spontaneously acquiring more energy is this tiny number. Familiar, everyday objects have many, many
times more particles than this. The chance of a hot object 
in the real world getting hotter is so absurdly small, it just never happens. Ice melts, cream mixes in, and tires deflate because these states have more
dispersed energy than the originals. There's no mysterious force
nudging the system towards higher entropy. It's just that higher entropy is always
statistically more likely. That's why entropy has been called
time's arrow. If energy has the opportunity
to spread out, it will.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Entropy is often called “time’s arrow” because:
Options: A. Trying to understand entropy hurts as much as being struck by arrow, B. Like other physical quantities such as velocity and force, entropy is a vector and therefore requires a direction (such as “north” or “down”) to be described completely, C. Macroscopic processes evolve toward a specific energy configuration (two objects in thermal equilibrium, air escaped out of a leaky tire, etc.) and never evolve away from that configuration
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What term is used to describe the concept that entropy tends to increase over time in a closed system?

**Transcript**:
Imagine a group of people. How big do you think the group
would have to be before there's more than a 50% chance
that two people in the group have the same birthday? Assume for the sake of argument
that there are no twins, that every birthday is equally likely, and ignore leap years. Take a moment to think about it. The answer may seem surprisingly low. In a group of 23 people, there's a 50.73% chance that 
two people will share the same birthday. But with 365 days in a year, how's it possible that you need such
a small group to get even odds of a shared birthday? Why is our intuition so wrong? To figure out the answer, let's look at one way a mathematician might calculate 
the odds of a birthday match. We can use a field of mathematics
known as combinatorics, which deals with the likelihoods
of different combinations. The first step is to flip the problem. Trying to calculate the odds 
of a match directly is challenging because there are many ways you
could get a birthday match in a group. Instead, it's easier to calculate the odds
that everyone's birthday is different. How does that help? Either there's a birthday match
in the group, or there isn't, so the odds of a match
and the odds of no match must add up to 100%. That means we can find 
the probability of a match by subtracting the probability
of no match from 100. To calculate the odds of no match,
start small. Calculate the odds that just one pair
of people have different birthdays. One day of the year will be
Person A's birthday, which leaves only 364 possible birthdays
for Person B. The probability of different birthdays
for A and B, or any pair of people, is 364 out of 365, about 0.997, or 99.7%, pretty high. Bring in Person C. The probability that she has 
a unique birthday in this small group is 363 out of 365 because there are two birthdates
already accounted for by A and B. D's odds will be 362 out of 365,
and so on, all the way down to W's odds
of 343 out of 365. Multiply all of those terms together, and you'll get the probability
that no one shares a birthday. This works out to 0.4927, so there's a 49.27% chance that no one in
the group of 23 people shares a birthday. When we subtract that from 100,
we get a 50.73% chance of at least one birthday match, better than even odds. The key to such a high probability 
of a match in a relatively small group is the surprisingly large number
of possible pairs. As a group grows, the number of possible 
combinations gets bigger much faster. A group of five people 
has ten possible pairs. Each of the five people can be paired
with any of the other four. Half of those combinations are redundant because pairing Person A with Person B
is the same as pairing B with A, so we divide by two. By the same reasoning, a group of ten people has 45 pairs, and a group of 23 has 253. The number of pairs grows quadratically, meaning it's proportional to the square
of the number of people in the group. Unfortunately, our brains 
are notoriously bad at intuitively grasping 
non-linear functions. So it seems improbable at first that 23
people could produce 253 possible pairs. Once our brains accept that,
the birthday problem makes more sense. Every one of those 253 pairs is a chance
for a birthday match. For the same reason,
in a group of 70 people, there are 2,415 possible pairs, and the probability that two people
have the same birthday is more than 99.9%. The birthday problem is just one example
where math can show that things that seem impossible, like the same person winning
the lottery twice, actually aren't unlikely at all. Sometimes coincidences aren't
as coincidental as they seem.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

that two people in the group have the same birthday? Assume for the sake of argument
that there are no twins, that every birthday is equally likely, and ignore leap years. Take a moment to think about it. The answer may seem surprisingly low. In a group of 23 people, there's a 50.73% chance that 
two people will share the same birthday. But with 365 days in a year, how's it possible that you need such
a small group to get even odds of a shared birthday? Why is our intuition so wrong? To figure out the answer, let's look at one way a mathematician might calculate 
the odds of a birthday match. We can use a field of mathematics
known as combinatorics, which deals with the likelihoods
of different combinations. The first step is to flip the problem. Trying to calculate the odds 
of a match directly is challenging because there are many ways you
could get a birthday match in a group. Instead, it's easier to calculate the odds
that everyone's birthday is different. How does that help? Either there's a birthday match
in the group, or there isn't, so the odds of a match
and the odds of no match must add up to 100%. That means we can find 
the probability of a match by subtracting the probability
of no match from 100. To calculate the odds of no match,
start small. Calculate the odds that just one pair
of people have different birthdays. One day of the year will be
Person A's birthday, which leaves only 364 possible birthdays
for Person B. The probability of different birthdays
for A and B, or any pair of people, is 364 out of 365, about 0.997, or 99.7%, pretty high. Bring in Person C. The probability that she has 
a unique birthday in this small group is 363 out of 365 because there are two birthdates
already accounted for by A and B. D's odds will be 362 out of 365,
and so on, all the way down to W's odds
of 343 out of 365. Multiply all of those terms together, and you'll get the probability
that no one shares a birthday. This works out to 0.4927, so there's a 49.27% chance that no one in
the group of 23 people shares a birthday. When we subtract that from 100,
we get a 50.73% chance of at least one birthday match, better than even odds. The key to such a high probability 
of a match in a relatively small group is the surprisingly large number
of possible pairs. As a group grows, the number of possible 
combinations gets bigger much faster. A group of five people 
has ten possible pairs. Each of the five people can be paired
with any of the other four. Half of those combinations are redundant because pairing Person A with Person B
is the same as pairing B with A, so we divide by two. By the same reasoning, a group of ten people has 45 pairs, and a group of 23 has 253. The number of pairs grows quadratically, meaning it's proportional to the square
of the number of people in the group. Unfortunately, our brains 
are notoriously bad at intuitively grasping 
non-linear functions. So it seems improbable at first that 23
people could produce 253 possible pairs. Once our brains accept that,
the birthday problem makes more sense. Every one of those 253 pairs is a chance
for a birthday match. For the same reason,
in a group of 70 people, there are 2,415 possible pairs, and the probability that two people
have the same birthday is more than 99.9%. The birthday problem is just one example
where math can show that things that seem impossible, like the same person winning
the lottery twice, actually aren't unlikely at all. Sometimes coincidences aren't
as coincidental as they seem.

**Transcript**:
It's a good day to be a pirate. Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins. But now, they must divvy up the booty
according to the pirate code. As captain, Amaro gets to propose
how to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate, 
including Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,
the coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain. Then, Bart gets to propose
a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again. If his plan is rejected,
he walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place. This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel
and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted
or there's only one pirate left. Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive
while getting as much gold as possible. But being pirates, 
none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain
walk the plank just for fun. Finally, each pirate is excellent
at logical deduction and knows that the others are, too. What distribution should Amaro
propose to make sure he lives? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan
being accepted. But it turns out he can do
much better than that. Why? Like we said, the pirates all know
each other to be top-notch logicians. So when each votes, they won't just
be thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes
down the line. And because the rank order is known
in advance, each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly. Because Eliza's last, she has the most
outcomes to consider, so let's start by following 
her thought process. She'd reason this out by working
backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining. Daniel would obviously propose
to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation
at all costs. Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left 
and Charlotte making the proposal. Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,
the decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold
while Eliza gets nothing. So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her
slightly more than nothing, one coin. Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel
anything at all. What if there are four pirates? As captain, Bart would still only need
one other vote for his plan to pass. He knows that Daniel wouldn't want 
the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin
for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote
with all five pirates standing. Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news 
for Charlotte and Eliza. So he offers them one coin each,
keeping 98 for himself. Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza 
grudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative 
would be worse for them. The pirate game involves some interesting
concepts from game theory. One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what
the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning. And the final distribution is an example
of a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other
players' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly. Even though it may lead to a worse
outcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit
by changing their strategy. So it looks like Amaro gets to keep
most of the gold, and the other pirates might need
to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code.

the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin
for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote
with all five pirates standing. Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news 
for Charlotte and Eliza. So he offers them one coin each,
keeping 98 for himself. Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza 
grudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative 
would be worse for them. The pirate game involves some interesting
concepts from game theory. One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what
the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning. And the final distribution is an example
of a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other
players' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly. Even though it may lead to a worse
outcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit
by changing their strategy. So it looks like Amaro gets to keep
most of the gold, and the other pirates might need
to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code.

**Transcript**:
It's a good day to be a pirate. Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins. But now, they must divvy up the booty
according to the pirate code. As captain, Amaro gets to propose
how to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate, 
including Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,
the coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain. Then, Bart gets to propose
a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again. If his plan is rejected,
he walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place. This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel
and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted
or there's only one pirate left. Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive
while getting as much gold as possible. But being pirates, 
none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain
walk the plank just for fun. Finally, each pirate is excellent
at logical deduction and knows that the others are, too. What distribution should Amaro
propose to make sure he lives? Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan
being accepted. But it turns out he can do
much better than that. Why? Like we said, the pirates all know
each other to be top-notch logicians. So when each votes, they won't just
be thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes
down the line. And because the rank order is known
in advance, each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly. Because Eliza's last, she has the most
outcomes to consider, so let's start by following 
her thought process. She'd reason this out by working
backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining. Daniel would obviously propose
to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation
at all costs. Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left 
and Charlotte making the proposal. Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,
the decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold
while Eliza gets nothing. So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her
slightly more than nothing, one coin. Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel
anything at all. What if there are four pirates? As captain, Bart would still only need
one other vote for his plan to pass. He knows that Daniel wouldn't want 
the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin
for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote

**Transcript**:
"War and Peace," a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed
because if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. "War and Peace" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination
of history, populated with some of the deepest, most
realistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,
just image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel
about a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced
a 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric 
aristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already
dropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment
to travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,
his ancestral mansion, to write about the return 
of the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries
pardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story 
of the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against 
the conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling
the story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous 
invasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism
the Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812
without talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of
the threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at 
the Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives 
that inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,
the class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority 
of the Russian population, who were peasants,
or even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners
of the land on which they lived. "War and Peace" opens on the eve
of war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret
about the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things
aristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces 
between the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters
in "War and Peace." Instead, readers enter
a vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless 
and illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive
the battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl
falling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle
with all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors
plays a background part. But while the characters 
and their psychologies are gripping, Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt 
the narrative to pose insightful 
questions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions
of so-called great men like Napoleon, or are there larger cultural and economic
forces at play? These extended digressions are part 
of what make "War and Peace" so panoramic in scope. But for some 19th century critics, this meant "War and Peace" barely felt
like a novel at all. It was a "large, loose, baggy monster,"
in the words of Henry James. Tolstoy, in fact, agreed. To him, novels were 
a western European form. Russian writers had to write differently
because Russian people lived differently. "What is 'War and Peace'?" he asked. "It is not a novel. Still less an epic poem. Still less a historical chronicle. 'War and Peace' is what the author wanted
and was able to express in the form in which it was expressed." It is, in other words, the sum total
of Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less. By the time "War and Peace" ends, Tolstoy has brought his characters
to the year 1820, 36 years before the events he originally
hoped to write about. In trying to understand his own times, he had become immersed in the years
piled up behind him. The result is a grand interrogation
into history, culture, philosophy, psychology, and the human response to war.

**Transcript**:
"War and Peace," a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed
because if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. "War and Peace" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination
of history, populated with some of the deepest, most
realistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,
just image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel
about a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced
a 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric 
aristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already
dropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment
to travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,
his ancestral mansion, to write about the return 
of the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries
pardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story 
of the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against 
the conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling
the story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous 
invasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism
the Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812
without talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of
the threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at 
the Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives 
that inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,
the class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority 
of the Russian population, who were peasants,
or even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners
of the land on which they lived. "War and Peace" opens on the eve
of war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret
about the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things
aristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces 
between the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters
in "War and Peace." Instead, readers enter
a vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless 
and illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive
the battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl
falling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle
with all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors
plays a background part. But while the characters 
and their psychologies are gripping, Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt 
the narrative to pose insightful 
questions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions
of so-called great men like Napoleon, or are there larger cultural and economic
forces at play? These extended digressions are part 
of what make "War and Peace" so panoramic in scope. But for some 19th century critics, this meant "War and Peace" barely felt
like a novel at all. It was a "large, loose, baggy monster,"
in the words of Henry James. Tolstoy, in fact, agreed. To him, novels were 
a western European form. Russian writers had to write differently
because Russian people lived differently. "What is 'War and Peace'?" he asked. "It is not a novel. Still less an epic poem. Still less a historical chronicle. 'War and Peace' is what the author wanted
and was able to express in the form in which it was expressed." It is, in other words, the sum total
of Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less. By the time "War and Peace" ends, Tolstoy has brought his characters
to the year 1820, 36 years before the events he originally
hoped to write about. In trying to understand his own times, he had become immersed in the years
piled up behind him. The result is a grand interrogation
into history, culture, philosophy, psychology, and the human response to war.

**Transcript**:
The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered "duck vagina,"
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.

**Transcript**:
The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered "duck vagina,"
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.

genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.

**Transcript**:
How did Dracula become
the world's most famous vampire? More than 100 years after
his creator was laid to rest, Dracula lives on as the most famous
vampire in history. But this Transylvanian noble, neither the first fictional vampire
nor the most popular of his time, may have remained buried
in obscurity if not for a twist of fate. Dracula's first appearance was in
Bram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same name. But that was far from the beginning
of vampire myths. Blood-sucking monsters had already been
part of folklore for at least 800 years. It was Slavic folklore that gave us
the word vampire, or "upir" in Old Russian. The term's first known written mention
comes from the 11th century. Vampire lore in the region predated
Christianity's arrival and persisted despite the church's efforts
to eliminate pagan beliefs. Stories of vampires originated from
misinterpretations of diseases, such as rabies, and pellagra, and decomposition. In the case of the latter, gasses swelling
the body and blood oozing from the mouth could make a corpse look like
it had recently been alive and feeding. Vampires were describe as bloated
with overgrown teeth and nails. This gave rise to many rituals
intended to prevent the dead from rising, such as burying bodies with garlic
or poppyseeds, as well as having them staked, burned, or mutilated. Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon
until the 18th century when Serbia was caught in the struggle
between two great powers, the Habsburg Monarchy and Ottoman Empire. Austrian soldiers and government officials
observed and documented the strange local burial rituals, and their reports 
became widely publicized. The resulting vampire hysteria
got so out of hand that in 1755, the Austrian Empress was forced 
to dispatch her personal physician. He investigated and put an end
to the rumors by publishing a thorough, 
scientific refutation. The panic subsided, but the vampire
had already taken root in Western Europe's imagination, spawning works like "The Vampyre" in 1819, and Joseph Sheridan
Le Fanu's "Carmilla" in 1872. This book would greatly influence a young
Irish drama critic named Bram Stoker. Stoker, who was born in Dublin in 1847, was famously bedridden with an unknown
illness until the age of seven. During that time, 
his mother told him folktales and true tales of horror, including her experiences during
an outbreak of cholera in 1832. There, she described victims buried alive
in mass graves. Later in his life, Stoker went on to write
fantasy, romance, adventure stories, and, in 1897, "Dracula." Although the book's main villain
and namesake is thought to be based on the historical
figure of Vlad III Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, the association is mostly just
that they share a name. Other elements and characters 
were inspired directly and indirectly by various works in the Victorian Era, such as "The Mysterious Stranger." The novel, upon release, was only
a moderate success in its day, nor was it even 
Stoker's most well-known work, mentioned only briefly in a 1912 obituary. But a critical copyright battle would
completely change Dracula's fate, and catapult the character
into literary renown. In 1922, a German studio adapted the novel
into the now classic silent film "Nosferatu" without paying royalties. Despite changes in character names
and minor plot points, the parallels were obvious,
and the studio was sued into bankruptcy. To prevent more plagiarism attempts, Stoker's widow decided
to establish copyright over the stage version of "Dracula" by approving a production 
by family-friend Hamilton Deane. Although Deane's adaptation made drastic
cuts to the story, it became a classic, thanks largely to Bela Lugosi's 
performance on Broadway. Lugosi would go on to star in
the 1931 film version by Universal, lending the character 
many of his signature characteristics. And since then, Dracula has risen again
in countless adaptations, finding eternal life far beyond
the humble pages of his birth.

**Transcript**:
How did Dracula become
the world's most famous vampire? More than 100 years after
his creator was laid to rest, Dracula lives on as the most famous
vampire in history. But this Transylvanian noble, neither the first fictional vampire
nor the most popular of his time, may have remained buried
in obscurity if not for a twist of fate. Dracula's first appearance was in
Bram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same name. But that was far from the beginning
of vampire myths. Blood-sucking monsters had already been
part of folklore for at least 800 years. It was Slavic folklore that gave us
the word vampire, or "upir" in Old Russian. The term's first known written mention
comes from the 11th century. Vampire lore in the region predated
Christianity's arrival and persisted despite the church's efforts
to eliminate pagan beliefs. Stories of vampires originated from
misinterpretations of diseases, such as rabies, and pellagra, and decomposition. In the case of the latter, gasses swelling
the body and blood oozing from the mouth could make a corpse look like
it had recently been alive and feeding. Vampires were describe as bloated
with overgrown teeth and nails. This gave rise to many rituals
intended to prevent the dead from rising, such as burying bodies with garlic
or poppyseeds, as well as having them staked, burned, or mutilated. Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon
until the 18th century when Serbia was caught in the struggle
between two great powers, the Habsburg Monarchy and Ottoman Empire. Austrian soldiers and government officials
observed and documented the strange local burial rituals, and their reports 
became widely publicized. The resulting vampire hysteria
got so out of hand that in 1755, the Austrian Empress was forced 
to dispatch her personal physician. He investigated and put an end
to the rumors by publishing a thorough, 
scientific refutation. The panic subsided, but the vampire
had already taken root in Western Europe's imagination, spawning works like "The Vampyre" in 1819, and Joseph Sheridan
Le Fanu's "Carmilla" in 1872. This book would greatly influence a young
Irish drama critic named Bram Stoker. Stoker, who was born in Dublin in 1847, was famously bedridden with an unknown
illness until the age of seven. During that time, 
his mother told him folktales and true tales of horror, including her experiences during
an outbreak of cholera in 1832. There, she described victims buried alive
in mass graves. Later in his life, Stoker went on to write
fantasy, romance, adventure stories, and, in 1897, "Dracula." Although the book's main villain
and namesake is thought to be based on the historical
figure of Vlad III Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, the association is mostly just
that they share a name. Other elements and characters 
were inspired directly and indirectly by various works in the Victorian Era, such as "The Mysterious Stranger." The novel, upon release, was only
a moderate success in its day, nor was it even 
Stoker's most well-known work, mentioned only briefly in a 1912 obituary. But a critical copyright battle would
completely change Dracula's fate, and catapult the character
into literary renown. In 1922, a German studio adapted the novel
into the now classic silent film "Nosferatu" without paying royalties. Despite changes in character names
and minor plot points, the parallels were obvious,
and the studio was sued into bankruptcy. To prevent more plagiarism attempts, Stoker's widow decided
to establish copyright over the stage version of "Dracula" by approving a production 
by family-friend Hamilton Deane. Although Deane's adaptation made drastic
cuts to the story, it became a classic, thanks largely to Bela Lugosi's 
performance on Broadway. Lugosi would go on to star in
the 1931 film version by Universal, lending the character 
many of his signature characteristics. And since then, Dracula has risen again
in countless adaptations, finding eternal life far beyond
the humble pages of his birth.

**Transcript**:
The secrets of the X chromosome. These women are identical twins. They have the same nose, the same hair color, the same eye color. But this one is color blind
for green light, and this one isn't. How is that possible? The answer lies in their genes. For humans, the genetic information
that determines our physical traits is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes
in the nucleus of every cell. These chromosomes are made up of proteins
and long, coiled strands of DNA. Segments of DNA, called genes,
tell the cell to build specific proteins, which control its identity and function. For every chromosome pair,
one comes from each biological parent. In 22 of these pairs, the chromosomes
contain the same set of genes, but may have different versions
of those genes. The differences arrive from mutations, which are changes to the genetic sequence that may have occurred 
many generations ago. Some of those changes have no effect, some cause diseases, and some lead to advantageous adaptations. The result of having two versions
of each gene is that you display a combination
of your biological parents' traits. But the 23rd pair is unique, and that's the secret behind
the one color blind twin. This pair, called the X and Y chromosomes,
influences your biological sex. Most women have two X chromosomes while most men have one X and one Y. The Y chromosome contains genes
for male development and fertility. The X chromosome, on the other hand, contains important genes for things other
than sex determination or reproduction, like nervous system development, skeletal muscle function, and the receptors in the eyes
that detect green light. Biological males with 
an XY chromosome pair only get one copy of all these
X chromosome genes, so the human body has evolved
to function without duplicates. But that creates a problem
for people with two X chromosomes. If both X chromosomes produced proteins,
as is normal in other chromosomes, development of the embryo would be
completely impaired. The solution is X inactivation. This happens early in development
when an embryo with two X chromosomes is just a ball of cells. Each cell inactivates one X chromosome. There's a certain degree of randomness
to this process. One cell may inactivate the X chromosome
from one parent, and another the chromosome
from the other parent. The inactive X shrivels into a clump
called a Barr body and goes silent. Almost none of its genes
order proteins to be made. When these early cells divide,
each passes on its X inactivation. So some clusters of cells
express the maternal X chromosome, while others express the paternal X. If these chromosomes
carry different traits, those differences 
will show up in the cells. This is why calico cats have patches. One X had a gene for orange fur
and the other had a gene for black fur. The pattern of the coat reveals
which one stayed active where. Now we can explain our color blind twin. Both sisters inherited one mutant copy
of the green receptor gene and one normally functioning copy. The embryo split into twins
before X inactivation, so each twin ended up
with a different inactivation pattern. In one, the X chromosome
with the normal gene was turned off in the cells that eventually became eyes. Without those genetic instructions, she now can't sense green light
and is color blind. Disorders that are associated
with mutations of X chromosome genes, like color blindness, or hemophilia, are often less severe in individuals
with two X chromosomes. That's because in someone with one normal
and one mutant copy of the gene, only some of their cells would be
affected by the mutation. This severity of the disorder
depends on which X got turned off and where those cells were. On the other hand, all the cells in
someone with only one X chromosome can only express the mutant copy
of the gene if that's what they inherited. There are still unresolved questions
about X inactivation, like how some genes on the X chromosome
escape inactivation and why inactivation isn't always random. What we do know is that this mechanism is one of the many ways that genes
alone don't tell our whole story.

for green light, and this one isn't. How is that possible? The answer lies in their genes. For humans, the genetic information
that determines our physical traits is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes
in the nucleus of every cell. These chromosomes are made up of proteins
and long, coiled strands of DNA. Segments of DNA, called genes,
tell the cell to build specific proteins, which control its identity and function. For every chromosome pair,
one comes from each biological parent. In 22 of these pairs, the chromosomes
contain the same set of genes, but may have different versions
of those genes. The differences arrive from mutations, which are changes to the genetic sequence that may have occurred 
many generations ago. Some of those changes have no effect, some cause diseases, and some lead to advantageous adaptations. The result of having two versions
of each gene is that you display a combination
of your biological parents' traits. But the 23rd pair is unique, and that's the secret behind
the one color blind twin. This pair, called the X and Y chromosomes,
influences your biological sex. Most women have two X chromosomes while most men have one X and one Y. The Y chromosome contains genes
for male development and fertility. The X chromosome, on the other hand, contains important genes for things other
than sex determination or reproduction, like nervous system development, skeletal muscle function, and the receptors in the eyes
that detect green light. Biological males with 
an XY chromosome pair only get one copy of all these
X chromosome genes, so the human body has evolved
to function without duplicates. But that creates a problem
for people with two X chromosomes. If both X chromosomes produced proteins,
as is normal in other chromosomes, development of the embryo would be
completely impaired. The solution is X inactivation. This happens early in development
when an embryo with two X chromosomes is just a ball of cells. Each cell inactivates one X chromosome. There's a certain degree of randomness
to this process. One cell may inactivate the X chromosome
from one parent, and another the chromosome
from the other parent. The inactive X shrivels into a clump
called a Barr body and goes silent. Almost none of its genes
order proteins to be made. When these early cells divide,
each passes on its X inactivation. So some clusters of cells
express the maternal X chromosome, while others express the paternal X. If these chromosomes
carry different traits, those differences 
will show up in the cells. This is why calico cats have patches. One X had a gene for orange fur
and the other had a gene for black fur. The pattern of the coat reveals
which one stayed active where. Now we can explain our color blind twin. Both sisters inherited one mutant copy
of the green receptor gene and one normally functioning copy. The embryo split into twins
before X inactivation, so each twin ended up
with a different inactivation pattern. In one, the X chromosome
with the normal gene was turned off in the cells that eventually became eyes. Without those genetic instructions, she now can't sense green light
and is color blind. Disorders that are associated
with mutations of X chromosome genes, like color blindness, or hemophilia, are often less severe in individuals
with two X chromosomes. That's because in someone with one normal
and one mutant copy of the gene, only some of their cells would be
affected by the mutation. This severity of the disorder
depends on which X got turned off and where those cells were. On the other hand, all the cells in
someone with only one X chromosome can only express the mutant copy
of the gene if that's what they inherited. There are still unresolved questions
about X inactivation, like how some genes on the X chromosome
escape inactivation and why inactivation isn't always random. What we do know is that this mechanism is one of the many ways that genes
alone don't tell our whole story.

**Transcript**:
What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.

**Transcript**:
What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.

**Transcript**:
You're standing at 
the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch
on the back of your head. We've all experienced the annoyance 
of an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why
we itch in the first place? The average person experiences
dozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts
of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. And then there are the mysterious ones
that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching. You're scratching your head right now,
aren't you? Anyhow, let's take one of the most
common sources: bug bites. When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body
called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting. That compound, 
which we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes 
our capillaries swell. This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates 
the body's immune response to this perceived threat. That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen
can make your eyes puff up. Histamine also activates the nerves
involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch. But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood. In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying 
the mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have discovered that
itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of
the nerves that are associated with pain. These dedicated nerves produce a molecule
called natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried
up the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch. When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal
that overrides the itching sensation. It's almost like a distraction,
which creates the sensation of relief. But is there actually an evolutionary
purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us? The leading theory is that our skin
has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks
from the outside world. Think about it. Our automatic scratching response
would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant. This might explain why we don't
feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how 
maddening that would be. In some people, glitches in the pathways
responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching
that can actually harm their health. One extreme example is a psychological
condition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies
are infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly. Another phenomenon 
called phantom itching can occur in patients 
who've had amputations. Because this injury has 
so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal 
nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs
that are no longer there. Doctors are now finding ways
to treat these itching anomalies. In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect
the remaining limb, which the patient scratches. That creates an illusion 
that tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary 
itch has been satisfied. Oddly enough, that actually works. Researchers are also searching
for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try
and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases. If having an unscratchable itch
feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed. The Italian poet wrote about
a section of hell where people were punished by being
left in pits to itch for all eternity.

the mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have discovered that
itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of
the nerves that are associated with pain. These dedicated nerves produce a molecule
called natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried
up the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch. When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal
that overrides the itching sensation. It's almost like a distraction,
which creates the sensation of relief. But is there actually an evolutionary
purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us? The leading theory is that our skin
has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks
from the outside world. Think about it. Our automatic scratching response
would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant. This might explain why we don't
feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how 
maddening that would be. In some people, glitches in the pathways
responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching
that can actually harm their health. One extreme example is a psychological
condition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies
are infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly. Another phenomenon 
called phantom itching can occur in patients 
who've had amputations. Because this injury has 
so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal 
nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs
that are no longer there. Doctors are now finding ways
to treat these itching anomalies. In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect
the remaining limb, which the patient scratches. That creates an illusion 
that tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary 
itch has been satisfied. Oddly enough, that actually works. Researchers are also searching
for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try
and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases. If having an unscratchable itch
feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed. The Italian poet wrote about
a section of hell where people were punished by being
left in pits to itch for all eternity.

**Transcript**:
You're standing at 
the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch
on the back of your head. We've all experienced the annoyance 
of an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why
we itch in the first place? The average person experiences
dozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts
of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. And then there are the mysterious ones
that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching. You're scratching your head right now,
aren't you? Anyhow, let's take one of the most
common sources: bug bites. When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body
called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting. That compound, 
which we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes 
our capillaries swell. This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates 
the body's immune response to this perceived threat. That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen
can make your eyes puff up. Histamine also activates the nerves
involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch. But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood. In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying 
the mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have discovered that

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years, while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated, but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results 
in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process
different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters. In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity. When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies
and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times
during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells
respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies
in longevity. So it's the combination 
of all these factors playing out to differing degrees
in different animals that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure
and nutrition. This, and other increases 
in life expectancy make us possibly the only species
on Earth to take control over our natural fate.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years, while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated, but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results 
in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process
different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters. In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity. When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies
and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times
during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells
respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies
in longevity. So it's the combination 
of all these factors playing out to differing degrees
in different animals that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure
and nutrition. This, and other increases 
in life expectancy make us possibly the only species
on Earth to take control over our natural fate.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The stereotype that men are smarter than women has a long history, but in the battle of the sexes, who actually has the superior intellect when it comes down to it? Are boys smarter than girls? Early studies show that male brains are 8 to 13 percent larger in volume than female brains, however this has been since attributed to differences in body size. Women's brains have more gyrofication or brain folding, and as a result, a greater cortical surface area. Besides, bigger isn't always better. Sperm whales, elephants and dolphins all have larger brains than humans, and while they are smart, their cognitive abilities are less than our own. There are other structural differences, though, like males having more connections within hemispheres, while women have more connections between hemispheres. But overall, MRI brain imaging shows significant overlap in the physical structure between the sexes. After studying 14 hundred brains and comparing the sexes, researchers found that mostly all men and woman show a mosaic of female and male typical structures in the brain. This study also evaluted gender stereotypical behaviours. Like how video games are often considered male behaviour while scrapbooking is female and the results found that 0.1% of test subjects displayed only male or only female typical behaviours. Tests on intelligence find similar results with major IQ studies showing neglible, or no sex differences in general intelligence but do show women having stronger verbal abilities while men show stronger visual-spatial abilities. Interestingly, studies show more male variance in tests with their scores being both the worst and the best. One meta analysis of 22 studies did fiund men to be 3.3 to 5.5 IQ points above women but this study has been called into question by academics who found the methodology flawed. In academic performance of language, math and science, women consistently received better grade in 70% of nations. But on SAT testing in the U.S. men scored 33 points higher in math and science. Other tests like the Program for International Student Assessment showed both sexes performing equally in several countries with girls performing better in some like Iceland suggesting cultural and environmental differences and not necessarily biological differences at play. But research has found that stereotypes about womens performance actually impact how well they do. When told that a particular math test had significant gender differences, women performed significantly worse than their male peers. While women who were told there was no difference, scored the same. This phenomenom is known as the stereotype threat. Even google search data shows that parents 2.5 times more likely to search is my son gifted than is my daughter gifted? Despite 11% more girls in gifted programs in America. And girls pick up on these bias as early as 6 years old. When told a story at age 5 about a person who is really really smart both boys and girls associate intelligence with there own gender but by age 6 both girls and boys picked a male character as the smartest. In a similar experiment kids were asked if they wanted to play a game for people who are really really smart and again at age 5 both sexes wanted to play but by age 6, girls had decided these games weren't for them. and though women do strive to work in STEM fields studies show they face barriers. In a double blind study science faculty from research universities rated applications for a lab manager position. What they didn't know is that the applications were randomly assigned either male or female names. As a result, faculty perceived the male applicant names to be significantly more competent, hireable and deserving of mentoring even though the applications with female names were identical. Males were also offered higher starting salaries, an average of 30,000 versus the females 26,000. Though these studies produce a sobering reality research does point to growing equality between the sexes with passing decades and education and in spite of these barriers women continue to contribute to our collective scientific knowledge. Rosalind Franklin allowed us to understand our own DNA, Katherine Johnson helped Apollo 11 land on the moon and this year Maryam Mirzakhani is the first women to win a Nobel prize for mathematics. Fellow mathematician Izabella Laba said "Mirzakhan's selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing mathematical research at the same level of men. I have never had any doubt about that in the first place.. What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of reconizing excellence in women's work." To learn more we asked the women at ASAP Science to speak personally about their experiences growing up and give insight about how they navigate the societal pressures of being a woman.

**Transcript**:
Your research team has found
a prehistoric virus preserved in the permafrost and isolated it for study. After a late night working, you're just closing up the lab
when a sudden earthquake hits and knocks out the power. As the emergency generators kick in,
an alarm confirms your worst fears: all the sample vials have broken. The virus is contained for now, but unless you can destroy it, the vents will soon open
and unleash a deadly airborne plague. Without hesitation, you grab
your HazMat suit and get ready to save the world. The lab is a four by four compound
of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner
and an exit at the southeast. Each room is connected to the adjacent
ones by an airlock, and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance. To destroy it, you must enter each
contaminated room and pull its emergency 
self-destruct switch. But there's a catch. Because the security system 
is on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without 
activating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go 
back in to that room. You start to draw out possible
routes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you
to the exit without missing at least one room. So how can you destroy the virus
in every contaminated room and survive to tell the story? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph
your possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea. This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish 
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. The challenge 
of the path problem is to find whether a given graph
has a Hamiltonian path. That's a route that visits 
every point within it exactly once. This type of problem, classified 
as NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph
is sufficiently large. Although any proposed solution
can be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one, or determining that one exists. And we're not even sure
if it's possible for computers to reliably find 
such solutions, either. This puzzle adds a twist
to the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start 
and end at specific points. But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true
Hamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points. That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side. In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and 
ends in opposite corners is impossible. Here's one way of understanding why. Consider a checkerboard grid with
an even number of squares on each side. Every path through it will alternate
black and white. These grids will all also have an even
total number of squares because an even number times
and even number is even. So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white. And one that starts on white
will have to end on black. However, in any grid with even
numbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully
and notice an important exception. It's true that once you activate
the switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back. But there's one room 
that wasn't contaminated - the entrance. This means that you can leave it once
without pulling the switch and return there when you've
destroyed either of these two rooms. The corner room may have
been contaminated from the airlock opening,
but that's okay because you can destroy the entrance
after your second visit. That return trip gives you four options
for a successful route, and a similar set of options if you
destroyed this room first. Congratulations. You've prevented
an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode,
you need a break. Maybe you should take up that recent
job offer to become a traveling salesman.

**Transcript**:
Your research team has found
a prehistoric virus preserved in the permafrost and isolated it for study. After a late night working, you're just closing up the lab
when a sudden earthquake hits and knocks out the power. As the emergency generators kick in,
an alarm confirms your worst fears: all the sample vials have broken. The virus is contained for now, but unless you can destroy it, the vents will soon open
and unleash a deadly airborne plague. Without hesitation, you grab
your HazMat suit and get ready to save the world. The lab is a four by four compound
of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner
and an exit at the southeast. Each room is connected to the adjacent
ones by an airlock, and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance. To destroy it, you must enter each
contaminated room and pull its emergency 
self-destruct switch. But there's a catch. Because the security system 
is on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without 
activating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go 
back in to that room. You start to draw out possible
routes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you
to the exit without missing at least one room. So how can you destroy the virus
in every contaminated room and survive to tell the story? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph
your possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea. This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish 
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. The challenge 
of the path problem is to find whether a given graph
has a Hamiltonian path. That's a route that visits 
every point within it exactly once. This type of problem, classified 
as NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph
is sufficiently large. Although any proposed solution
can be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one, or determining that one exists. And we're not even sure
if it's possible for computers to reliably find 
such solutions, either. This puzzle adds a twist
to the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start 
and end at specific points. But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true
Hamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points. That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side. In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and 
ends in opposite corners is impossible. Here's one way of understanding why. Consider a checkerboard grid with
an even number of squares on each side. Every path through it will alternate
black and white. These grids will all also have an even
total number of squares because an even number times
and even number is even. So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white. And one that starts on white
will have to end on black. However, in any grid with even
numbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully
and notice an important exception. It's true that once you activate
the switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back. But there's one room 
that wasn't contaminated - the entrance. This means that you can leave it once
without pulling the switch and return there when you've
destroyed either of these two rooms. The corner room may have
been contaminated from the airlock opening,
but that's okay because you can destroy the entrance
after your second visit. That return trip gives you four options
for a successful route, and a similar set of options if you
destroyed this room first. Congratulations. You've prevented
an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode,
you need a break. Maybe you should take up that recent
job offer to become a traveling salesman.

**Transcript**:
On September 6, 1522, the "Victoria" sailed into harbor
in southern Spain. The battered vessel and its 18
sailors were all that remained of a fleet that had departed
three years before. Yet her voyage was considered a success for the "Victoria" had achieved
something unprecedented: the first circumnavigation
of the globe. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage
on behalf of Spain. Columbus's discovery had prompted
the Catholic Spanish rulers to turn to the Pope to preempt
any claims by Portugal to the new lands. The Pope resolved this dispute by drawing
an imaginary line on the world map. Spain had the right to claim territories
west of the divide, and Portugal to the east. Spain and Portugal, the two major
seafaring super powers at the time, agreed to these terms in what came
to be called the Treaty of Tordesillas. At the time, these nations had their
eyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands
in today's Indonesia. The spices found there, which were used as seasonings, food preservatives, and aphrodisiacs, were worth many times 
their weight in gold. But because of Portugal's control
over eastern sea routes, Spain's only viable option
was to sail west. So when a Portuguese defector
named Ferdinand Magellan claimed that a westward route
to the Spice Islands existed, King Charles made him captain
of a Spanish armada, and gave him all the resources 
he would need. Along with a share 
in the voyage's profits, he granted Magellan five ships
and about 260 men. The crew included a young slave
named Enrique, captured by Magellan on a previous
journey to Malacca, and Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian nobleman seeking adventure. On September 20, 1519, 
the fleet weighed anchor and headed southwest. After making landfall 
in what is now Brazil, it proceeded along the coast,
exploring any water way leading inland. They were looking for the fabled passage
linking east and west. As the weather worsened, the Spaniards resentment
at having a Portuguese captain escalated. A full-blown mutiny soon erupted, which Magellan crushed 
with unspeakable cruelty. But his problems were only just beginning. During a reconnaissance mission, 
the "Santiago" was wrecked by a storm. Then while exploring a narrow waterway, the captain of the "San Antonio" took
the first opportunity to slip away and sail back home. Magellan pressed forward, and on October 21, he started exploring
a navigable sea way. 27 freezing days later, the three remaining ships emerged
from what we now call the Strait of Magellan
into the Mar Pacifico. The fleet never expected the new ocean
to be so vast. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors
had succumbed to scurvy and famine. When they finally reached land again, Enrique, the young slave, proved
able to communicate with the natives. Their goal couldn't be far. Sailing further west, Magellan was warmly
received by Rajah Humabon of Cebu. So when the ruler asked him to help subdue and convert 
the rebellious chief of Mactan, the captain readily agreed. The adventure would be his last. Overconfident and severely outnumbered,
Magellan's force was overwhelmed, and the native's bamboo spears
ended the captain's life. Yet the voyage had to continue. Magellan's will specified that Enrique
should be freed, but the expedition still needed
an interpreter. With his freedom at stake, Enrique is believed to have plotted
with the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed
at a feast on the beach. Enrique was never heard from again, but if he ever made it back to Malacca, he may have been the first person
to actually circumnavigate the globe. Meanwhile, the survivors 
burned the Concepcion and proceeded onward. They finally reached the Spice Islands
in November of 1521 and loaded up on precious cargo. But they still had to return to Spain. The "Trinidad" sank shortly after being
captured by the Portuguese. The "Victoria" continued west,
piloted by Juan Sebastián Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. Against all odds, the small vessel
made it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition
and turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands
and people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled 
the world's first phrase book of native languages. His journal is the reason we can
tell this story. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs
named after him. Elcano, too, was celebrated in Spain with a coat of arms and his face
on currency and stamps. United by fate, the survivors and the hundreds 
who sacrificed their lives challenged conventional wisdom and completed a historic journey
once thought impossible.

**Transcript**:
On September 6, 1522, the "Victoria" sailed into harbor
in southern Spain. The battered vessel and its 18
sailors were all that remained of a fleet that had departed
three years before. Yet her voyage was considered a success for the "Victoria" had achieved
something unprecedented: the first circumnavigation
of the globe. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage
on behalf of Spain. Columbus's discovery had prompted
the Catholic Spanish rulers to turn to the Pope to preempt
any claims by Portugal to the new lands. The Pope resolved this dispute by drawing
an imaginary line on the world map. Spain had the right to claim territories
west of the divide, and Portugal to the east. Spain and Portugal, the two major
seafaring super powers at the time, agreed to these terms in what came
to be called the Treaty of Tordesillas. At the time, these nations had their
eyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands
in today's Indonesia. The spices found there, which were used as seasonings, food preservatives, and aphrodisiacs, were worth many times 
their weight in gold. But because of Portugal's control
over eastern sea routes, Spain's only viable option
was to sail west. So when a Portuguese defector
named Ferdinand Magellan claimed that a westward route
to the Spice Islands existed, King Charles made him captain
of a Spanish armada, and gave him all the resources 
he would need. Along with a share 
in the voyage's profits, he granted Magellan five ships
and about 260 men. The crew included a young slave
named Enrique, captured by Magellan on a previous
journey to Malacca, and Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian nobleman seeking adventure. On September 20, 1519, 
the fleet weighed anchor and headed southwest. After making landfall 
in what is now Brazil, it proceeded along the coast,
exploring any water way leading inland. They were looking for the fabled passage
linking east and west. As the weather worsened, the Spaniards resentment
at having a Portuguese captain escalated. A full-blown mutiny soon erupted, which Magellan crushed 
with unspeakable cruelty. But his problems were only just beginning. During a reconnaissance mission, 
the "Santiago" was wrecked by a storm. Then while exploring a narrow waterway, the captain of the "San Antonio" took
the first opportunity to slip away and sail back home. Magellan pressed forward, and on October 21, he started exploring
a navigable sea way. 27 freezing days later, the three remaining ships emerged
from what we now call the Strait of Magellan
into the Mar Pacifico. The fleet never expected the new ocean
to be so vast. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors
had succumbed to scurvy and famine. When they finally reached land again, Enrique, the young slave, proved
able to communicate with the natives. Their goal couldn't be far. Sailing further west, Magellan was warmly
received by Rajah Humabon of Cebu. So when the ruler asked him to help subdue and convert 
the rebellious chief of Mactan, the captain readily agreed. The adventure would be his last. Overconfident and severely outnumbered,
Magellan's force was overwhelmed, and the native's bamboo spears
ended the captain's life. Yet the voyage had to continue. Magellan's will specified that Enrique
should be freed, but the expedition still needed
an interpreter. With his freedom at stake, Enrique is believed to have plotted
with the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed
at a feast on the beach. Enrique was never heard from again, but if he ever made it back to Malacca, he may have been the first person
to actually circumnavigate the globe. Meanwhile, the survivors 
burned the Concepcion and proceeded onward. They finally reached the Spice Islands
in November of 1521 and loaded up on precious cargo. But they still had to return to Spain. The "Trinidad" sank shortly after being
captured by the Portuguese. The "Victoria" continued west,
piloted by Juan Sebastián Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. Against all odds, the small vessel
made it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition
and turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands
and people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled 
the world's first phrase book of native languages. His journal is the reason we can
tell this story. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs
named after him. Elcano, too, was celebrated in Spain with a coat of arms and his face
on currency and stamps. United by fate, the survivors and the hundreds 
who sacrificed their lives challenged conventional wisdom and completed a historic journey
once thought impossible.
