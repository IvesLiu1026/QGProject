**Transcript**:
The night before the Death Race 
across the Wastelands is set to begin, your uncle, 
the great inventor Slate Kanoli, got kidnapped 
by the ruthless No-Side gang. The only way to get him back 
is to race his Coil Runner against the gang yourself. Win and they’ll give back your uncle. Lose and you’ll forfeit the Coil Runner 
and all his other creations. As the grueling race gets underway, you find yourself falling further 
and further behind. Your only chance is to take a shortcut 
your uncle told you about–– the Flux Ravine gambit. Fortunately, the Coil Runner comes 
equipped with emergency turbo thrusters. Unfortunately, your uncle 
was a notorious tinkerer, and the system still had some kinks 
to work out. Just minor things 
like the ignition exploding, the reactor leaking, 
or the oxygen levels depleting— any of which would end 
your racing career immediately. Before his kidnapping, Uncle Slate determined 
that each of these critical failures was the ultimate result 
of a chain reaction originating in the thrusters. He was also certain that while one factor
could trigger two different effects, and two factors could each independently
lead to the same effect, no effect is caused by two factors 
in conjunction. However, Uncle Slate 
never got around to pinpointing which thruster was responsible 
for which error. All you have 
are the notes from his test runs: 1. When thrusters B and C are on, 
the Fuel gauge glows. 2.	When thrusters A, B, and D are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Helium tank rattles. 3.	When thrusters C, D, and E are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins. 4.	When thrusters A, D, and E are on, the Gravitometer spins 
and the Helium tank rattles. 5.	Shortly after the Helium tank rattles 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Ignition explodes 
and the Oxygen levels deplete. 6.	Shortly after the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Reactor leaks. You need to use 
as many thrusters as possible to give yourself the best chance 
at clearing the gap, without triggering any of the three 
catastrophic failures. Which thrusters should you activate? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The most important thing 
to remember here is that even if we know 
that one thing causes another, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, this panic switch 
shuts off the coil runner’s engine. But the engine being off 
doesn’t necessarily mean the panic switch was engaged— the coil runner could be 
out of fuel, or damaged— or turned off normally. We can, however, 
conclude that if the engine is running, the panic switch hasn’t been engaged. With that in mind, one way we can start 
is to work backwards from the three defects that could 
knock you out of the race. So let’s look at Slate’s last two notes, since they give direct information 
about those. The Gravitometer spins in both cases, 
but the results are different. That means the spinning Gravitometer can’t be the cause 
of any particular malfunction. If it were, the same thing would happen 
each time. So we can conclude that a glowing 
Fuel gauge makes the reactor leak, while a rattling Helium tank 
makes the Ignition explode and depletes the Oxygen levels. Once we know which two errors 
we need to avoid, we can make a table 
and use the logic of cause and effect to see which thrusters trigger them. Since the Helium tank is fine 
during the first test run when thrusters B and C are active, we can assume neither makes it rattle. And from the third run 
we know that D and E don’t either. That leaves thruster A, which was indeed used 
in the second and fourth test runs where the Helium tank rattled. Now what causes the glowing Fuel gauge? From the fourth test run we know 
it can’t be thrusters A, D, or E. So is the culprit, B, C, 
or each of them separately? The answer can be found 
in the second and third test runs: the fuel tank glowed in both, 
but B was activated in one, and C in the other. That means the B and C thrusters each 
independently make the Fuel tank glow. It looks like the A, B, and C 
thrusters are off limits. Fortunately, the other two 
are just enough to clear the jump. You rocket into first place and the gang 
begrudgingly hands over your uncle. He thanks you profusely, 
and decides to celebrate your victory with a cup of tea 
from his latest contraption...

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 6 does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent of identifying which option is NOT one of the deadly malfunctions, I re-evaluated the generated MCQs.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ's intent. But if I had to choose one that is vaguely related to the topic of malfunctions, I would say Question 6 is the closest.

But since it's not a good match, I'll say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I really had to choose, I'd say: Question 6 (with the caveat that it's not a good match).

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The night before the Death Race 
across the Wastelands is set to begin, your uncle, 
the great inventor Slate Kanoli, got kidnapped 
by the ruthless No-Side gang. The only way to get him back 
is to race his Coil Runner against the gang yourself. Win and they’ll give back your uncle. Lose and you’ll forfeit the Coil Runner 
and all his other creations. As the grueling race gets underway, you find yourself falling further 
and further behind. Your only chance is to take a shortcut 
your uncle told you about–– the Flux Ravine gambit. Fortunately, the Coil Runner comes 
equipped with emergency turbo thrusters. Unfortunately, your uncle 
was a notorious tinkerer, and the system still had some kinks 
to work out. Just minor things 
like the ignition exploding, the reactor leaking, 
or the oxygen levels depleting— any of which would end 
your racing career immediately. Before his kidnapping, Uncle Slate determined 
that each of these critical failures was the ultimate result 
of a chain reaction originating in the thrusters. He was also certain that while one factor
could trigger two different effects, and two factors could each independently
lead to the same effect, no effect is caused by two factors 
in conjunction. However, Uncle Slate 
never got around to pinpointing which thruster was responsible 
for which error. All you have 
are the notes from his test runs: 1. When thrusters B and C are on, 
the Fuel gauge glows. 2.	When thrusters A, B, and D are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Helium tank rattles. 3.	When thrusters C, D, and E are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins. 4.	When thrusters A, D, and E are on, the Gravitometer spins 
and the Helium tank rattles. 5.	Shortly after the Helium tank rattles 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Ignition explodes 
and the Oxygen levels deplete. 6.	Shortly after the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Reactor leaks. You need to use 
as many thrusters as possible to give yourself the best chance 
at clearing the gap, without triggering any of the three 
catastrophic failures. Which thrusters should you activate? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The most important thing 
to remember here is that even if we know 
that one thing causes another, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, this panic switch 
shuts off the coil runner’s engine. But the engine being off 
doesn’t necessarily mean the panic switch was engaged— the coil runner could be 
out of fuel, or damaged— or turned off normally. We can, however, 
conclude that if the engine is running, the panic switch hasn’t been engaged. With that in mind, one way we can start 
is to work backwards from the three defects that could 
knock you out of the race. So let’s look at Slate’s last two notes, since they give direct information 
about those. The Gravitometer spins in both cases, 
but the results are different. That means the spinning Gravitometer can’t be the cause 
of any particular malfunction. If it were, the same thing would happen 
each time. So we can conclude that a glowing 
Fuel gauge makes the reactor leak, while a rattling Helium tank 
makes the Ignition explode and depletes the Oxygen levels. Once we know which two errors 
we need to avoid, we can make a table 
and use the logic of cause and effect to see which thrusters trigger them. Since the Helium tank is fine 
during the first test run when thrusters B and C are active, we can assume neither makes it rattle. And from the third run 
we know that D and E don’t either. That leaves thruster A, which was indeed used 
in the second and fourth test runs where the Helium tank rattled. Now what causes the glowing Fuel gauge? From the fourth test run we know 
it can’t be thrusters A, D, or E. So is the culprit, B, C, 
or each of them separately? The answer can be found 
in the second and third test runs: the fuel tank glowed in both, 
but B was activated in one, and C in the other. That means the B and C thrusters each 
independently make the Fuel tank glow. It looks like the A, B, and C 
thrusters are off limits. Fortunately, the other two 
are just enough to clear the jump. You rocket into first place and the gang 
begrudgingly hands over your uncle. He thanks you profusely, 
and decides to celebrate your victory with a cup of tea 
from his latest contraption...

**Transcript**:
A new drug reduces 
the risk of heart attacks by 40%. Shark attacks are up by a factor of two. Drinking a liter of soda per day 
doubles your chance of developing cancer. These are all examples of relative risk, a common way risk 
is presented in news articles. Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle 
of statistical thinking and personal preference. One common stumbling block 
is the difference between relative risks like these 
and what are called absolute risks. Risk is the likelihood 
that an event will occur. It can be expressed 
as either a percentage— for example, that heart attacks 
occur in 11% of men between the ages of 60 and 79— or as a rate— that one in two million 
divers along Australia’s western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year. These numbers express 
the absolute risk of heart attacks and shark attacks in these groups. Changes in risk can be expressed 
in relative or absolute terms. For example, a review in 2009 
found that mammography screenings reduced the number of breast cancer deaths
from five women in one thousand to four. The absolute risk reduction 
was about .1%. But the relative risk reduction 
from 5 cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%. Based on reports of this higher number, people overestimated 
the impact of screening. To see why the difference between 
the two ways of expressing risk matters, let’s consider 
the hypothetical example of a drug that reduces heart attack risk by 40%. Imagine that out of a group 
of 1,000 people who didn’t take the new drug, 
10 would have heart attacks. The absolute risk 
is 10 out of 1,000, or 1%. If a similar group of 1,000 people 
did take the drug, the number of heart attacks would be six. In other words, the drug could prevent 
four out of ten heart attacks— a relative risk reduction of 40%. Meanwhile, the absolute risk 
only dropped from 1% to 0.6%— but the 40% relative risk decrease 
sounds a lot more significant. Surely preventing 
even a handful of heart attacks, or any other negative outcome, 
is worthwhile— isn’t it? Not necessarily. The problem is that choices 
that reduce some risks can put you in the path of others. Suppose the heart-attack drug caused 
cancer in one half of 1% of patients. In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks 
would be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be 
five new cases of cancer. The relative reduction 
in heart attack risk sounds substantial and the absolute risk of cancer 
sounds small, but they work out 
to about the same number of cases. In real life, everyone’s individual evaluation of risk 
will vary depending on 
their personal circumstances. If you know you have a family history 
of heart disease you might be more strongly motivated 
to take a medication that would lower your heart-attack risk, even knowing it provided 
only a small reduction in absolute risk. Sometimes, we have to decide between 
exposing ourselves to risks that aren’t directly comparable. If, for example, the heart attack drug 
carried a higher risk of a debilitating, 
but not life-threatening, side effect like migraines 
rather than cancer, our evaluation of whether that risk 
is worth taking might change. And sometimes there isn’t necessarily 
a correct choice: some might say even a minuscule risk 
of shark attack is worth avoiding, because all you’d miss out on 
is an ocean swim, while others wouldn’t even consider 
skipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk 
of shark attack. For all these reasons, 
risk evaluation is tricky at baseline, and reporting on risk can be misleading, especially when it shares some numbers 
in absolute terms and others in relative terms. Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through 
some of the confusion and better evaluate risk.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: What is the absolute risk reduction of mammography screenings, according to the 2009 review?

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, as both questions ask about the absolute risk reduction. Although the context is different (mammography screenings vs. colon cancer), the question type and format are similar.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs, as none of them specifically ask about colon cancer or an 18% relative risk increase.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 (index 4) is the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A new drug reduces 
the risk of heart attacks by 40%. Shark attacks are up by a factor of two. Drinking a liter of soda per day 
doubles your chance of developing cancer. These are all examples of relative risk, a common way risk 
is presented in news articles. Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle 
of statistical thinking and personal preference. One common stumbling block 
is the difference between relative risks like these 
and what are called absolute risks. Risk is the likelihood 
that an event will occur. It can be expressed 
as either a percentage— for example, that heart attacks 
occur in 11% of men between the ages of 60 and 79— or as a rate— that one in two million 
divers along Australia’s western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year. These numbers express 
the absolute risk of heart attacks and shark attacks in these groups. Changes in risk can be expressed 
in relative or absolute terms. For example, a review in 2009 
found that mammography screenings reduced the number of breast cancer deaths
from five women in one thousand to four. The absolute risk reduction 
was about .1%. But the relative risk reduction 
from 5 cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%. Based on reports of this higher number, people overestimated 
the impact of screening. To see why the difference between 
the two ways of expressing risk matters, let’s consider 
the hypothetical example of a drug that reduces heart attack risk by 40%. Imagine that out of a group 
of 1,000 people who didn’t take the new drug, 
10 would have heart attacks. The absolute risk 
is 10 out of 1,000, or 1%. If a similar group of 1,000 people 
did take the drug, the number of heart attacks would be six. In other words, the drug could prevent 
four out of ten heart attacks— a relative risk reduction of 40%. Meanwhile, the absolute risk 
only dropped from 1% to 0.6%— but the 40% relative risk decrease 
sounds a lot more significant. Surely preventing 
even a handful of heart attacks, or any other negative outcome, 
is worthwhile— isn’t it? Not necessarily. The problem is that choices 
that reduce some risks can put you in the path of others. Suppose the heart-attack drug caused 
cancer in one half of 1% of patients. In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks 
would be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be 
five new cases of cancer. The relative reduction 
in heart attack risk sounds substantial and the absolute risk of cancer 
sounds small, but they work out 
to about the same number of cases. In real life, everyone’s individual evaluation of risk 
will vary depending on 
their personal circumstances. If you know you have a family history 
of heart disease you might be more strongly motivated 
to take a medication that would lower your heart-attack risk, even knowing it provided 
only a small reduction in absolute risk. Sometimes, we have to decide between 
exposing ourselves to risks that aren’t directly comparable. If, for example, the heart attack drug 
carried a higher risk of a debilitating, 
but not life-threatening, side effect like migraines 
rather than cancer, our evaluation of whether that risk 
is worth taking might change. And sometimes there isn’t necessarily 
a correct choice: some might say even a minuscule risk 
of shark attack is worth avoiding, because all you’d miss out on 
is an ocean swim, while others wouldn’t even consider 
skipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk 
of shark attack. For all these reasons, 
risk evaluation is tricky at baseline, and reporting on risk can be misleading, especially when it shares some numbers 
in absolute terms and others in relative terms. Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through 
some of the confusion and better evaluate risk.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In the 1970s, the Mexican government had a problem: the capacity of the Viaducto (a highway with two lanes on each side) was too small, but the government did not have the necessary resources. But they had a brilliant idea: to buy paint, and repaint the highway in order to make three lanes out of two. That effort resulted increased the capacity by 50%. Unfortunately, the smaller lanes lead to a substantial increase of deadly traffic accidents. So the government once again bought paint, and repainted the highways, from three to two lanes. That decreased the capacity by 33%. At the end, it was announced that all these efforts had increased the capacity by 17%. Is there anything wrong with this announcement?
Options: A. It is not correct to add up relative increases and reductions., B. It is not correct to add up absolute increases and reductions., C. Nothing is wrong, except that the government did not report the costs of the paint., D. Nothing is wrong, the government had a magical idea.

**Transcript**:
In the 8th century CE, 
Vikings surged across the misty seas. They came from Scandinavia 
in Northern Europe but would travel far and wide. Some plundered and settled 
in the British Isles and France; others braved Artic exploration or forged clever new trade routes 
to the Middle East. With their steely navigational skills, 
advanced long-ships and fearsome tactics, the Vikings sustained their seafaring 
for over three hundred years. But for all their might, 
they left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone, 
bark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Found in graves, bogs, 
and sites of ancient settlements, many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse 
written in runic letters. But the Vikings also scratched runes
into household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes. Deciphering these messages 
is no easy task. Runes are short, straight, 
and diagonal lines that make up an alphabet 
called the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote 
this language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, 
they wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds 
of their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore 
the influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,”
for example, is originally a Latin phrase 
from the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, 
were carved in verse, highlighting the tradition 
of Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists 
can read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining 
mysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories 
have been deciphered— along with some 
containing magical incantations. The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved 
on a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground. This causeway was commissioned 
by a prominent local woman named Sigríðr. She proclaimed both her importance 
and her family’s power by carving their names in stone, and even associated herself 
and her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of Sigurd 
the dragon slayer. In the town of Jelling in Denmark, two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations
of a royal family. The first was erected by King Gorm the Old
in memory of his Queen Thyrvi, and the second by their son, 
Harald Bluetooth, after Gorm’s death. The stones announce the power 
of this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical
documents of Denmark. They indicate that Denmark 
was the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled 
southern Norway, and that he converted to Christianity. Today, Harald Bluetooth’s initials 
make up the Bluetooth logo. The 10th century warrior poet Egil 
was a well-known carver of runes. According to poetic accounts, he once 
carved runes on a horn filled with poison, causing the horn to shatter. In another story, Egil saves a young girl’s life 
by placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing runes 
under her pillow. Norse poetry tells of runic spells, 
cast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells 
isn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords,
axes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be 
incantations, riddles, or religious messages. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end
of the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion 
had mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak 
versions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas
into the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing 
at their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup
stone has fearsomely declared 
for a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone
or drags it in memory of another!”

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ asks about the language spoken by the Vikings. The correct option is "Futhark," but it's essential to note that Futhark is actually the runic alphabet used by the Vikings, not the language itself. The language spoken by the Vikings is Old Norse.

Considering the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the language spoken by the Vikings. However, Question 2 mentions how the Vikings wrote individual runic letters, which is related to their writing system and language.

A more relevant question is Question 7, which asks about the influence of other cultures on the Vikings' runic inscriptions. Although it doesn't directly ask about the language, it mentions the incorporation of phrases and ideas from other cultures, such as Latin, which is related to the language and writing system.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is not available as it does not ask about the language spoken by the Vikings. But if we had to choose the closest one, it would be Question 2, as it talks about the writing system used by the Vikings.

**Transcript**:
In the 8th century CE, 
Vikings surged across the misty seas. They came from Scandinavia 
in Northern Europe but would travel far and wide. Some plundered and settled 
in the British Isles and France; others braved Artic exploration or forged clever new trade routes 
to the Middle East. With their steely navigational skills, 
advanced long-ships and fearsome tactics, the Vikings sustained their seafaring 
for over three hundred years. But for all their might, 
they left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone, 
bark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Found in graves, bogs, 
and sites of ancient settlements, many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse 
written in runic letters. But the Vikings also scratched runes
into household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes. Deciphering these messages 
is no easy task. Runes are short, straight, 
and diagonal lines that make up an alphabet 
called the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote 
this language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, 
they wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds 
of their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore 
the influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,”
for example, is originally a Latin phrase 
from the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, 
were carved in verse, highlighting the tradition 
of Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists 
can read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining 
mysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories 
have been deciphered— along with some 
containing magical incantations. The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved 
on a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground. This causeway was commissioned 
by a prominent local woman named Sigríðr. She proclaimed both her importance 
and her family’s power by carving their names in stone, and even associated herself 
and her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of Sigurd 
the dragon slayer. In the town of Jelling in Denmark, two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations
of a royal family. The first was erected by King Gorm the Old
in memory of his Queen Thyrvi, and the second by their son, 
Harald Bluetooth, after Gorm’s death. The stones announce the power 
of this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical
documents of Denmark. They indicate that Denmark 
was the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled 
southern Norway, and that he converted to Christianity. Today, Harald Bluetooth’s initials 
make up the Bluetooth logo. The 10th century warrior poet Egil 
was a well-known carver of runes. According to poetic accounts, he once 
carved runes on a horn filled with poison, causing the horn to shatter. In another story, Egil saves a young girl’s life 
by placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing runes 
under her pillow. Norse poetry tells of runic spells, 
cast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells 
isn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords,
axes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be 
incantations, riddles, or religious messages. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end
of the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion 
had mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak 
versions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas
into the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing 
at their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup
stone has fearsomely declared 
for a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone
or drags it in memory of another!”

**Transcript**:
In 1881, doctor William Halsted 
rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was hemorrhaging after childbirth. He quickly inserted 
a needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, 
and transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes, 
she began to recover. Halsted didn’t know 
how lucky they’d gotten. His transfusion only worked 
because he and his sister happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, 
even among close relatives. Blood types hadn’t been discovered 
by Halsted’s time, though people had been experimenting 
with transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully. In 1667, a French physician 
named Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique 
on a human. Denis transfused sheep’s blood 
into Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce 
his symptoms. Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits. But after a second transfusion, 
he developed a fever, severe pain in his lower back, 
intense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid. Though nobody knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous 
immune response unfolding inside his body. This immune response starts 
with the production of proteins called antibodies, which distinguish the body’s 
own cells from intruders. They do so by recognizing 
the foreign proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s 
cell membrane. Antibodies latch onto the antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack 
and destroy the foreign cells. The destroyed cells are flushed 
from the body in urine. In extreme cases, 
the massive break down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that 
disrupt the flow of blood to vital organs, overload the kidneys, 
and cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient 
survived the transfusion. But, after other cross-species 
transfusions proved fatal, the procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor 
for several centuries. It wasn’t until 1901 
that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the crucial step in the success 
of human to human blood transfusions. He noticed that when different types 
were mixed together, they formed clots. This happens when antibodies 
latch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump together. But if the donor cells are the same 
blood type as the recipient’s cells, the donor cells won’t be flagged 
for destruction, and won’t form clumps. By 1907, doctors were mixing together small amounts
of blood before transfusing it. If there were no clumps, 
the types were a match. This enabled them 
to save thousands of lives, laying the foundation 
for modern transfusions. Up to this point, all transfusions 
had occurred in real time, directly between two individuals. That’s because blood 
begins to clot almost immediately after coming into contact with air— a defense mechanism to prevent 
excessive blood loss after injury. In 1914, researchers discovered 
that the chemical sodium citrate stopped blood coagulating by removing 
the calcium necessary for clot formation. Citrated blood could be stored 
for later use— the first step in making large scale 
blood transfusions possible. In 1916, a pair of American scientists 
found an even more effective anticoagulant called heparin, which works by 
deactivating enzymes that enable clotting. We still use heparin today. At the same time, American and British researchers 
developed portable machines that could transport donor blood 
onto the battlefields of World War I. Combined with 
the newly-discovered heparin, medics safely stored 
and preserved liters of blood, wheeling it directly onto the battlefield 
to transfuse wounded soldiers. After the war, this crude portable box 
would become the inspiration for the modern-day blood bank, 
a fixture of hospitals around the world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the clotting of blood and its impact on transfusions. The ground truth MCQ asks why the first successful transfusions were limited to real-time procedures, and the correct answer is that donor blood quickly clots when removed from the body. Question 7 asks about the role of sodium citrate in blood transfusions, and the correct answer is that it stops blood coagulating by removing the calcium necessary for clot formation. 

However, a more similar question would be one that directly addresses the issue of blood clotting as a limitation for transfusions. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

That being said, another question that addresses the concept of blood clotting is Question 9, which mentions the significance of portable machines that enabled the transportation of donor blood onto the battlefield. However, it does not directly address the issue of clotting.

Considering the available options, Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the concept of blood clotting and its prevention.

**Transcript**:
In 1881, doctor William Halsted 
rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was hemorrhaging after childbirth. He quickly inserted 
a needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, 
and transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes, 
she began to recover. Halsted didn’t know 
how lucky they’d gotten. His transfusion only worked 
because he and his sister happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, 
even among close relatives. Blood types hadn’t been discovered 
by Halsted’s time, though people had been experimenting 
with transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully. In 1667, a French physician 
named Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique 
on a human. Denis transfused sheep’s blood 
into Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce 
his symptoms. Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits. But after a second transfusion, 
he developed a fever, severe pain in his lower back, 
intense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid. Though nobody knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous 
immune response unfolding inside his body. This immune response starts 
with the production of proteins called antibodies, which distinguish the body’s 
own cells from intruders. They do so by recognizing 
the foreign proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s 
cell membrane. Antibodies latch onto the antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack 
and destroy the foreign cells. The destroyed cells are flushed 
from the body in urine. In extreme cases, 
the massive break down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that 
disrupt the flow of blood to vital organs, overload the kidneys, 
and cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient 
survived the transfusion. But, after other cross-species 
transfusions proved fatal, the procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor 
for several centuries. It wasn’t until 1901 
that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the crucial step in the success 
of human to human blood transfusions. He noticed that when different types 
were mixed together, they formed clots. This happens when antibodies 
latch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump together. But if the donor cells are the same 
blood type as the recipient’s cells, the donor cells won’t be flagged 
for destruction, and won’t form clumps. By 1907, doctors were mixing together small amounts
of blood before transfusing it. If there were no clumps, 
the types were a match. This enabled them 
to save thousands of lives, laying the foundation 
for modern transfusions. Up to this point, all transfusions 
had occurred in real time, directly between two individuals. That’s because blood 
begins to clot almost immediately after coming into contact with air— a defense mechanism to prevent 
excessive blood loss after injury. In 1914, researchers discovered 
that the chemical sodium citrate stopped blood coagulating by removing 
the calcium necessary for clot formation. Citrated blood could be stored 
for later use— the first step in making large scale 
blood transfusions possible. In 1916, a pair of American scientists 
found an even more effective anticoagulant called heparin, which works by 
deactivating enzymes that enable clotting. We still use heparin today. At the same time, American and British researchers 
developed portable machines that could transport donor blood 
onto the battlefields of World War I. Combined with 
the newly-discovered heparin, medics safely stored 
and preserved liters of blood, wheeling it directly onto the battlefield 
to transfuse wounded soldiers. After the war, this crude portable box 
would become the inspiration for the modern-day blood bank, 
a fixture of hospitals around the world.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges 
were collapsing all across Europe. Their industrial cables 
frayed during turbulent weather and snapped 
under the weight of their decks. So when a German-American engineer 
named John Roebling proposed building the largest 
and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived 
over New York’s East River, city officials 
were understandably skeptical. But Manhattan 
was increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn 
clogged the river. In February of 1867, the government 
approved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures 
of European bridges, Roebling designed 
a hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by 
central pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal 
for supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model 
also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures 
held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, 
Roebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight 
on its anchor cables. Similar designs had been used 
for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here
dwarfed them all. His new bridge’s deck
spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built
suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope 
would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for 
over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand 
over 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures 
in the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident 
his design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat 
crushed his foot against the dock. Within a month, 
tetanus had claimed his life. Fortunately, John Roebling's son, 
Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. The following year, construction 
on the tower foundations finally began. This first step in construction 
was also the most challenging. Building on the rocky river bed involved 
the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these airtight 
wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped 
pressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks 
allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone 
on top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, 
they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s 
permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons 
were dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, 
the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was 
a mysterious ailment called "the bends." Today, we understand this 
as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be 
an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly claimed the life 
of the chief engineer. Washington survived, 
but was left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again, 
the Roeblings proved indomitable. Washington’s wife Emily 
not only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over 
day-to-day project management. Unfortunately, 
the bridge’s troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget 
and behind schedule. Worse still, it turned out 
the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires. This would have been a fatal flaw 
if not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design. After reinforcing the cables 
with additional wires, they suspended the deck 
piece by piece. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent 
of over 400 million dollars, and the life’s work 
of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge 
finally opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable. Today, the Brooklyn Bridge 
still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic towers 
and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City.

allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone 
on top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, 
they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s 
permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons 
were dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, 
the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was 
a mysterious ailment called "the bends." Today, we understand this 
as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be 
an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly claimed the life 
of the chief engineer. Washington survived, 
but was left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again, 
the Roeblings proved indomitable. Washington’s wife Emily 
not only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over 
day-to-day project management. Unfortunately, 
the bridge’s troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget 
and behind schedule. Worse still, it turned out 
the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires. This would have been a fatal flaw 
if not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design. After reinforcing the cables 
with additional wires, they suspended the deck 
piece by piece. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent 
of over 400 million dollars, and the life’s work 
of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge 
finally opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable. Today, the Brooklyn Bridge 
still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic towers 
and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges 
were collapsing all across Europe. Their industrial cables 
frayed during turbulent weather and snapped 
under the weight of their decks. So when a German-American engineer 
named John Roebling proposed building the largest 
and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived 
over New York’s East River, city officials 
were understandably skeptical. But Manhattan 
was increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn 
clogged the river. In February of 1867, the government 
approved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures 
of European bridges, Roebling designed 
a hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by 
central pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal 
for supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model 
also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures 
held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, 
Roebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight 
on its anchor cables. Similar designs had been used 
for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here
dwarfed them all. His new bridge’s deck
spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built
suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope 
would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for 
over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand 
over 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures 
in the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident 
his design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat 
crushed his foot against the dock. Within a month, 
tetanus had claimed his life. Fortunately, John Roebling's son, 
Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. The following year, construction 
on the tower foundations finally began. This first step in construction 
was also the most challenging. Building on the rocky river bed involved 
the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these airtight 
wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped 
pressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks 
allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone 
on top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, 
they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s 
permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons 
were dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, 
the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was 
a mysterious ailment called "the bends." Today, we understand this

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar.

Question 4 discusses the length of the Brooklyn Bridge's deck and how it compares to previously built suspension bridges. While it does not directly ask about the construction time, it does provide information about the bridge's features and construction.

However, if I had to choose an answer based on the question intent (i.e., the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge), I would say that Question 8 is also a possible match. Question 8 discusses a major flaw discovered during the bridge's construction and how it was addressed, which is related to the construction process and timeline.

But since none of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new question that directly asks about the construction time.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
London, 1928: a group of mold spores 
surf a breeze through a lab. They drift onto a petri dish, 
and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, 
a Scottish scientist investigating the properties 
of infectious bacteria. At this time, 
Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds 
a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold 
is a zone completely and unexpectedly 
clear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold 
was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species 
in the Penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed 
the antibacterial compound “penicillin.” What Fleming stumbled upon 
was a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold 
constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies 
that might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys 
many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis 
of their cell walls. These walls get their strength 
from a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids, that are constantly being 
broken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the compounds 
that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being 
reconstructed at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates 
the release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell’s structure 
breaks down completely. This two-pronged attack 
is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in petri-dishes, 
our bodies, or elsewhere. It’s not, however, 
harmful to our own cells, because those don’t have cell walls. For a decade or so 
after Fleming’s discovery, penicillin remained 
a laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate 
the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities. They then went on to win 
the Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several American 
drug companies continued development, and within a few years 
it was commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly 
transformed the treatment of infections. For the time being, they remain some of the most important, 
life-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, 
the more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds 
that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis. As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria 
have evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number 
of bacterial infections. This means it’s essential that doctors 
not overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients 
in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported 
drug allergy. However, the vast majority— over 90%—
of people who think they’re allergic 
to penicillin actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label 
as children, when a rash appears after they’re treated 
for an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit 
is the original infection, or a reaction between the infection 
and the antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems 
mistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely 
and can be very dangerous. So if you think you’re allergic 
but don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They’ll complete an evaluation 
that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug 
may lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people 
who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy 
within ten years. This is great news for people 
who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, 
as it has done for so many others.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the source of penicillin, and the correct answer is "The mold penicillium." While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the source of penicillin, Question 2 mentions the mold penicillium in the context of Alexander Fleming's discovery.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question 2: What unexpected observation did Alexander Fleming make upon returning to his lab from vacation?**

This question mentions the mold penicillium, which is the source of penicillin, but it does not directly ask about the source of penicillin.

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the source of penicillin would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
London, 1928: a group of mold spores 
surf a breeze through a lab. They drift onto a petri dish, 
and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, 
a Scottish scientist investigating the properties 
of infectious bacteria. At this time, 
Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds 
a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold 
is a zone completely and unexpectedly 
clear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold 
was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species 
in the Penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed 
the antibacterial compound “penicillin.” What Fleming stumbled upon 
was a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold 
constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies 
that might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys 
many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis 
of their cell walls. These walls get their strength 
from a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids, that are constantly being 
broken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the compounds 
that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being 
reconstructed at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates 
the release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell’s structure 
breaks down completely. This two-pronged attack 
is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in petri-dishes, 
our bodies, or elsewhere. It’s not, however, 
harmful to our own cells, because those don’t have cell walls. For a decade or so 
after Fleming’s discovery, penicillin remained 
a laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate 
the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities. They then went on to win 
the Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several American 
drug companies continued development, and within a few years 
it was commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly 
transformed the treatment of infections. For the time being, they remain some of the most important, 
life-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, 
the more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds 
that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis. As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria 
have evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number 
of bacterial infections. This means it’s essential that doctors 
not overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients 
in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported 
drug allergy. However, the vast majority— over 90%—
of people who think they’re allergic 
to penicillin actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label 
as children, when a rash appears after they’re treated 
for an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit 
is the original infection, or a reaction between the infection 
and the antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems 
mistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely 
and can be very dangerous. So if you think you’re allergic 
but don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They’ll complete an evaluation 
that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug 
may lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people 
who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy 
within ten years. This is great news for people 
who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, 
as it has done for so many others.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.**

Although Question 2 does not directly ask "Who discovered penicillin?", it mentions Alexander Fleming and his observation that led to the discovery of penicillin. The other generated MCQs do not directly relate to the discovery of penicillin or the person who discovered it.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **2**

However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ that directly asks "Who discovered penicillin?" with the same options as the ground truth MCQ would be a more accurate match.

**Transcript**:
Someone has tripped the magical alarms 
in the Element Temple. By the time you and the other monks 
arrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster 
on your hands. Overnight, four young apprentices 
broke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals. But when the alarm went off 
they panicked, and each of them swallowed the crystal 
they held right before they were caught. With no idea how to control 
the crystals’ vast powers, they’ll soon transform 
into uncontrollable elemental spirits. Improbably enough, the old monk next to you 
has seen something similar happen before. He explains: 
“You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the proper containment 
field before they transform. The elements compel their masters: those who ate the Earth and Water Crystals
must speak the truth, while those who consumed Fire and Air 
must lie." The youths are too scared to confess 
their own transgressions. Instead, they fall to accusing each other. “Rikku took the Water crystal!” 
Sumi blurts out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, 
she stole the Fire crystal!” So Bella yells: 
“Jonah ate the Air crystal, I saw him!” Jonah looks up timidly 
and shakes his head. “I… I don’t know what happened, 
but Sumi doesn’t have the Earth crystal.” So who ate which crystal? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. There’s no getting around it— 
this will take some trial and error. But that’s not a bad thing. If we make a wrong guess, we’ll eventually reach a point where 
our conclusions contradict each other. That would allow us to confirm 
that our initial guess was wrong and work from there. This is a technique 
known as proof by contradiction. The trick is in being strategic 
about where we begin our guessing. Some assumptions 
might not lead to contradictions without making further assumptions. We want to pick one that creates 
the most constraints on its own, and thus gives us the most information 
when it turns out to be right or wrong. Take, for example, Sumi’s statement. If we assume she’s telling the truth, we’d know the identity 
of both truth tellers. Rikku would have the Water crystal, 
and since she’s not lying about him, Sumi would have Earth. So Bella would have the Fire crystal, 
as Rikku says. But then Bella would have to be lying 
about Jonah having the Air crystal. And yet that’s the only remaining option. This is a contradiction, and it tells us 
our initial assumption was wrong. So now we can go back to the start, but with the added knowledge 
that Sumi is lying. As a liar, Sumi 
must either have the Fire or Air crystal. That means Jonah 
was telling the truth about her, so he can’t have taken either of those. And that means Bella was lying about him, so she must also have either Fire or Air. Since Sumi was lying, 
Rikku can’t have taken the Water crystal— the only one left 
who could have it is Jonah. And because we’ve already identified 
the two liars, Rikku must have the Earth crystal. That means Bella has the Fire crystal 
and Sumi has Air. You manage to get them all 
in the proper containment fields just as the crystals’ magic 
begins to manifest. Compared with the difficult task 
of training these kids to control their new powers, figuring out who had which crystal
was elementary.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect of the crystals on the children, and the correct option is "Turn them into unstable elementals." Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest in terms of intent, but it doesn't match exactly. However, I found that Question 9's content is related to the consequence of the crystals, which is the main theme of the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one that is more closely related to the effect of the crystals, I would suggest Question 2, which talks about the characteristics of those who consumed the Earth and Water Crystals. However, it still doesn't match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

If I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the closest, but I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the one that is most similar in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reason for finding out which child took which crystal, and the correct option is related to placing each one in the proper containment field.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most similar, but it doesn't match exactly. However, I found that the containment field is mentioned in the solution to the puzzle (in the transcript), and it's also mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match can be found in the transcript, where it says: "You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the proper containment field before they transform."

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this specific reason. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, as it asks about the final solution to the puzzle, which involves determining who ate which crystal and, implicitly, placing them in the proper containment field.

However, if I really had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but if I really had to pick one that was very loosely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say:

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the closest match in terms of intent and content. However, it does not ask about why the apprentices make statements about each other. Instead, it asks about what can be concluded about Sumi after finding the contradiction.

A closer match is not available, but if I had to choose, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, although it's not a perfect match.

However, I must note that the transcript does contain a sentence that matches the ground truth MCQ: "The youths are too scared to confess their own transgressions. Instead, they fall to accusing each other."

If I had to create a new MCQ based on this sentence, it would be:

Question: Why do the young apprentices accuse each other instead of confessing their own actions?
Options: A. They are trying to confuse the monks., B. The crystals prevent them from talking about themselves., C. They are afraid to confess their own theft.
Correct Option: C

This new MCQ would be a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

Since I couldn't find a perfect match among the generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. However, I can suggest that Question 6 is the closest match, although it's not a perfect match.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Someone has tripped the magical alarms 
in the Element Temple. By the time you and the other monks 
arrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster 
on your hands. Overnight, four young apprentices 
broke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals. But when the alarm went off 
they panicked, and each of them swallowed the crystal 
they held right before they were caught. With no idea how to control 
the crystals’ vast powers, they’ll soon transform 
into uncontrollable elemental spirits. Improbably enough, the old monk next to you 
has seen something similar happen before. He explains: 
“You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the proper containment 
field before they transform. The elements compel their masters: those who ate the Earth and Water Crystals
must speak the truth, while those who consumed Fire and Air 
must lie." The youths are too scared to confess 
their own transgressions. Instead, they fall to accusing each other. “Rikku took the Water crystal!” 
Sumi blurts out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, 
she stole the Fire crystal!” So Bella yells: 
“Jonah ate the Air crystal, I saw him!” Jonah looks up timidly 
and shakes his head. “I… I don’t know what happened, 
but Sumi doesn’t have the Earth crystal.” So who ate which crystal? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. There’s no getting around it— 
this will take some trial and error. But that’s not a bad thing. If we make a wrong guess, we’ll eventually reach a point where 
our conclusions contradict each other. That would allow us to confirm 
that our initial guess was wrong and work from there. This is a technique 
known as proof by contradiction. The trick is in being strategic 
about where we begin our guessing. Some assumptions 
might not lead to contradictions without making further assumptions. We want to pick one that creates 
the most constraints on its own, and thus gives us the most information 
when it turns out to be right or wrong. Take, for example, Sumi’s statement. If we assume she’s telling the truth, we’d know the identity 
of both truth tellers. Rikku would have the Water crystal, 
and since she’s not lying about him, Sumi would have Earth. So Bella would have the Fire crystal, 
as Rikku says. But then Bella would have to be lying 
about Jonah having the Air crystal. And yet that’s the only remaining option. This is a contradiction, and it tells us 
our initial assumption was wrong. So now we can go back to the start, but with the added knowledge 
that Sumi is lying. As a liar, Sumi 
must either have the Fire or Air crystal. That means Jonah 
was telling the truth about her, so he can’t have taken either of those. And that means Bella was lying about him, so she must also have either Fire or Air. Since Sumi was lying, 
Rikku can’t have taken the Water crystal— the only one left 
who could have it is Jonah. And because we’ve already identified 
the two liars, Rikku must have the Earth crystal. That means Bella has the Fire crystal 
and Sumi has Air. You manage to get them all 
in the proper containment fields just as the crystals’ magic 
begins to manifest. Compared with the difficult task 
of training these kids to control their new powers, figuring out who had which crystal
was elementary.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Jonah's statement regarding Sumi, specifically what he says about her. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, which asks about the conclusion drawn about Sumi after finding a contradiction. Although it doesn't directly ask about Jonah's statement, it does relate to the same part of the story where Jonah makes a statement about Sumi.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that more closely matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest that there is no direct match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of context.

But since it does not directly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ I would say that there is no match.

If I really had to choose I would say: 
 Question 6

**Transcript**:
In 1972, Thomas Sankara 
was swept into a revolution for a country not his own. Hailing from the West African nation 
of Burkina Faso— then known as Upper Volta— the 22-year-old soldier 
had travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon arriving, 
he found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries 
sought to wrest control of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors 
inspired Sankara to read works by socialist leaders
like Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy. When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free 
his country from its colonial legacy. Born in 1949, Sankara was raised 
in a relatively privileged household as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, 
but like many of his peers, Sankara saw the military 
as the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma 
and transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular 
with the reigning government. Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power 
in the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies 
were a far cry from the sweeping changes 
Sankara proposed, but, by 1981, 
Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role 
in Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara," 
Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, 
he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, 
he delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, 
women, and young people. He even tried to persuade 
other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors 
felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would 
harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months 
after becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration 
forced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest. Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s 
4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests 
ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate 
a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend 
and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included 
an attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned 
without further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara 
became the new President of Upper Volta. Finally in charge, 
Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, 
he renamed the country from its French colonial title 
"Upper Volta" to "Burkina Faso," which translates 
to “Land of Upright Men." Over the next four years he established 
a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting 
of over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down 
inflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element 
of Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement 
for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, 
polygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint
women to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military. However, Sankara’s socialist policies 
were met with much resistance. Many students and elites 
believed his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso 
from its capitalist peers. His crackdown 
on the misuse of public funds turned government officials 
against him as well. After four years, 
what began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready 
to yield his power. He executed 
increasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions 
and the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned even his closest friends 
against him. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a meeting 
when a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters. Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered 
by his friend Blaise Compaoré. Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have proven 
themselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have celebrated 
Sankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even 
adopted Sankara’s economic models. On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara 
was erected in Burkina Faso’s capital, establishing his place 
as an icon of revolution for his country and throughout the world.

had travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon arriving, 
he found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries 
sought to wrest control of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors 
inspired Sankara to read works by socialist leaders
like Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy. When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free 
his country from its colonial legacy. Born in 1949, Sankara was raised 
in a relatively privileged household as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, 
but like many of his peers, Sankara saw the military 
as the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma 
and transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular 
with the reigning government. Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power 
in the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies 
were a far cry from the sweeping changes 
Sankara proposed, but, by 1981, 
Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role 
in Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara," 
Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, 
he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, 
he delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, 
women, and young people. He even tried to persuade 
other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors 
felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would 
harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months 
after becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration 
forced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest. Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s 
4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests 
ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate 
a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend 
and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included 
an attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned 
without further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara 
became the new President of Upper Volta. Finally in charge, 
Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, 
he renamed the country from its French colonial title 
"Upper Volta" to "Burkina Faso," which translates 
to “Land of Upright Men." Over the next four years he established 
a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting 
of over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down 
inflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element 
of Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement 
for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, 
polygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint
women to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military. However, Sankara’s socialist policies 
were met with much resistance. Many students and elites 
believed his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso 
from its capitalist peers. His crackdown 
on the misuse of public funds turned government officials 
against him as well. After four years, 
what began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready 
to yield his power. He executed 
increasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions 
and the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned even his closest friends 
against him. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a meeting 
when a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters. Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered 
by his friend Blaise Compaoré. Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have proven 
themselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have celebrated 
Sankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even 
adopted Sankara’s economic models. On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara 
was erected in Burkina Faso’s capital, establishing his place 
as an icon of revolution for his country and throughout the world.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
As the April sun rises 
on a pile of firewood, something royal stirs inside. This wasp queen is one of thousands 
who mated in late autumn and hibernated through the winter. Now she emerges into the spring air 
to begin her reign. Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky. While hibernating in compost piles 
and underground burrows, many sleeping queens 
were eaten by spiders. Warm winters caused by climate change 
led other queens to emerge early, only to find there was no available food. And some queens that survived the winter 
fell victim to the threats of spring, such as carnivorous plants, birds, 
and manmade pesticides. Our queen is the lone survivor 
of her old hive, and now, she must become 
the foundress of a new one. But first, breakfast. The queen heads for a citrus grove 
full of honeybee hives. The bees can be dangerous if provoked, but right now they’re paralyzed 
by the morning cold. Their hairy bodies are dripping 
with sugar water from an earlier feeding, and the resourceful queen 
licks them for a morning snack. Newly energized, our queen searches 
for a safe nesting area. This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, 
and predators, is ideal. She chews the surrounding wood 
and plant fibers to make a paper-like pulp. Then she builds around 50 brood cells 
that comprise the beginning of her nest. Using sperm stored from last fall, the queen lays a fertilized egg 
into each cell, producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes. Within a week, 
these will hatch into female larva. But until then, the queen must hunt down 
smaller insects to feed her brood, all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,
and defending against intruders. Fortunately, our queen is well prepared. Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times
as they need to. With such a busy schedule, 
the queen barely has time to feed herself. Luckily, she doesn’t have to. When she feeds an insect to her grubs, they digest the bug into a sugary 
substance that sustains their mother. By the end of July, these first larva 
have matured into adult workers, ready to take on foraging, 
building, and defense. The queen can now lay eggs full-time, sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils 
and their unfertilized eggs. Although each worker only lives 
for roughly 3 weeks, the queen’s continuous egg-laying 
swells their ranks. In just one summer, 
the nest reaches the size of a basketball, supporting thousands of workers. Such a large population needs to eat, and the nearby garden 
provides a veritable buffet. As the swarm descends, 
alarmed humans try to swat them. They even fight back with pesticides 
that purposefully poison wasps, and inadvertently impact 
a wide-range of local wildlife. But the wasps are actually vital 
to this ecosystem. Sitting at the top 
of the local invertebrate food chain, these insects keep spiders, mites, 
and centipedes, in check. Wasps consume crop-eating insects, making them particularly helpful 
for farms and gardens. They even pollinate fruits and vegetables, and help winemakers 
by biting into their grapes and jump-starting fermentation. This feast continues until autumn, 
when the foundress changes course. She begins grooming some eggs 
into a new generation of queens, while also laying unfertilized eggs that will mature into reproductive males 
called drones. This new crop of queens and males 
requires more food. But with summer over, 
the usual sources run dry, and the foraging wasps 
start taking more aggressive risks. By September, 
the hive’s organization deteriorates. Hungry workers no longer clean the nest 
and various scavengers move in. Just when it seems 
the hive can no longer sustain itself, the fertile queens and their drones 
depart in a massive swarm. As the days grow colder, 
the workers starve, and our queen 
reaches the end of her lifespan. But above, a swarm of reproductive wasps 
has successfully mated. The males die off shortly after, but the newly fertilized queens are ready 
to find shelter for their long sleep. And this woodpile looks like 
the perfect place to spend the winter.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the size of a typical wasp nest in one summer. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about nest size, Question 6 mentions the growth of the hive population, which is indirectly related to the nest size.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in terms of intent and content, I would suggest Question 9. This question asks about the primary goal of the queen's activities in the summer, which includes establishing a new hive and expanding the colony. While it doesn't directly ask about nest size, it is related to the growth and development of the hive, which is the context in which the ground truth MCQ is asked.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As the April sun rises 
on a pile of firewood, something royal stirs inside. This wasp queen is one of thousands 
who mated in late autumn and hibernated through the winter. Now she emerges into the spring air 
to begin her reign. Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky. While hibernating in compost piles 
and underground burrows, many sleeping queens 
were eaten by spiders. Warm winters caused by climate change 
led other queens to emerge early, only to find there was no available food. And some queens that survived the winter 
fell victim to the threats of spring, such as carnivorous plants, birds, 
and manmade pesticides. Our queen is the lone survivor 
of her old hive, and now, she must become 
the foundress of a new one. But first, breakfast. The queen heads for a citrus grove 
full of honeybee hives. The bees can be dangerous if provoked, but right now they’re paralyzed 
by the morning cold. Their hairy bodies are dripping 
with sugar water from an earlier feeding, and the resourceful queen 
licks them for a morning snack. Newly energized, our queen searches 
for a safe nesting area. This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, 
and predators, is ideal. She chews the surrounding wood 
and plant fibers to make a paper-like pulp. Then she builds around 50 brood cells 
that comprise the beginning of her nest. Using sperm stored from last fall, the queen lays a fertilized egg 
into each cell, producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes. Within a week, 
these will hatch into female larva. But until then, the queen must hunt down 
smaller insects to feed her brood, all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,
and defending against intruders. Fortunately, our queen is well prepared. Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times
as they need to. With such a busy schedule, 
the queen barely has time to feed herself. Luckily, she doesn’t have to. When she feeds an insect to her grubs, they digest the bug into a sugary 
substance that sustains their mother. By the end of July, these first larva 
have matured into adult workers, ready to take on foraging, 
building, and defense. The queen can now lay eggs full-time, sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils 
and their unfertilized eggs. Although each worker only lives 
for roughly 3 weeks, the queen’s continuous egg-laying 
swells their ranks. In just one summer, 
the nest reaches the size of a basketball, supporting thousands of workers. Such a large population needs to eat, and the nearby garden 
provides a veritable buffet. As the swarm descends, 
alarmed humans try to swat them. They even fight back with pesticides 
that purposefully poison wasps, and inadvertently impact 
a wide-range of local wildlife. But the wasps are actually vital 
to this ecosystem. Sitting at the top 
of the local invertebrate food chain, these insects keep spiders, mites, 
and centipedes, in check. Wasps consume crop-eating insects, making them particularly helpful 
for farms and gardens. They even pollinate fruits and vegetables, and help winemakers 
by biting into their grapes and jump-starting fermentation. This feast continues until autumn, 
when the foundress changes course. She begins grooming some eggs 
into a new generation of queens, while also laying unfertilized eggs that will mature into reproductive males 
called drones. This new crop of queens and males 
requires more food. But with summer over, 
the usual sources run dry, and the foraging wasps 
start taking more aggressive risks. By September, 
the hive’s organization deteriorates. Hungry workers no longer clean the nest 
and various scavengers move in. Just when it seems 
the hive can no longer sustain itself, the fertile queens and their drones 
depart in a massive swarm. As the days grow colder, 
the workers starve, and our queen 
reaches the end of her lifespan. But above, a swarm of reproductive wasps 
has successfully mated. The males die off shortly after, but the newly fertilized queens are ready 
to find shelter for their long sleep. And this woodpile looks like 
the perfect place to spend the winter.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 has some relation with the terms in the question. However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the term for reproductive male wasps.

However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that defines the roles or terms related to the wasp colony members. Among the options, Question 4 defines a unique characteristic of wasps but does not directly relate to the reproductive male wasps term.


If I had to choose the closest match based on the content and the options provided, I would say that none of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can provide a suggestion for the closest match:


 Question 9 discusses the queen's activities and life cycle but also mentions "groom a new generation of queens and prepare for succession" and the generation of reproductive males in the transcript. Although it does not directly ask for the term for reproductive male wasps, it is somewhat related to the information provided in the ground truth MCQ.


However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.


If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but with a significant reservation that it does not directly ask the same question as the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
At any given moment, trillions of cells 
are traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body 
in just one minute. Each of these cells 
has its origins deep in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, 
but they’re actually quite porous inside. Large and small blood vessels 
enter through these holes. And inside most of the large bones 
of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat 
and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements 
are blood stem cells. These stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate 
into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions 
of new blood cells into circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes 
in small capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels 
and exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance 
it can be traced back to the bone marrow. Blood cancers often begin 
with genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells themselves 
are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere 
with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced 
blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often 
an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow 
with a donor’s. Here’s how it works. First, blood stem cells 
are extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out 
of the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood 
through a machine that separates it 
into different components. In other cases, 
the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, 
with a needle. Meanwhile, the recipient 
prepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation 
kill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells 
and blood stem cells. This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely 
to attack the transplanted cells. Then the donor cells are infused into 
the patient’s body through a central line. They initially circulate 
in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, 
called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them 
back to the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing
new, healthy blood cells. Just a small population 
of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s 
worth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant 
can also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells 
generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s 
original immune system couldn’t. This phenomenon can help eradicate 
stubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants 
also come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease. It happens when the immune system 
generated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs. This life-threatening condition 
occurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells 
from anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells 
are collected from the blood 
as opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take 
immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed 
from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk 
of graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient 
avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system 
may reject the donor cells. So it’s crucial to find the best match 
possible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic code 
determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are similar 
in the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system 
is more likely to accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, 
the best matches are often siblings. But many patients 
who need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member. Those patients 
turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is 
a cheek swab to test for a genetic match. And in many cases, 
the donation itself isn’t much more complicated 
than giving blood. It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource 
that’s completely renewable.

It is a life-threatening condition that attacks the patient's organs, B. It is a phenomenon where new immune cells generated by the donated marrow wipe out cancer cells, C. It is a type of chemotherapy that kills malignant cells, D. It is a medication that suppresses the immune system Correct Option: B

Although this generated MCQ does not directly ask which disease is not a blood cancer, it does relate to the topic of blood cancers and bone marrow transplants, which is the context of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question type (i.e., identifying a disease that is not a specific type of disease), I would suggest:

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question type and content.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but with a low degree of similarity.

Index: 5 (with a low degree of similarity)

**Transcript**:
At any given moment, trillions of cells 
are traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body 
in just one minute. Each of these cells 
has its origins deep in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, 
but they’re actually quite porous inside. Large and small blood vessels 
enter through these holes. And inside most of the large bones 
of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat 
and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements 
are blood stem cells. These stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate 
into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions 
of new blood cells into circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes 
in small capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels 
and exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance 
it can be traced back to the bone marrow. Blood cancers often begin 
with genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells themselves 
are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere 
with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced 
blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often 
an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow 
with a donor’s. Here’s how it works. First, blood stem cells 
are extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out 
of the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood 
through a machine that separates it 
into different components. In other cases, 
the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, 
with a needle. Meanwhile, the recipient 
prepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation 
kill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells 
and blood stem cells. This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely 
to attack the transplanted cells. Then the donor cells are infused into 
the patient’s body through a central line. They initially circulate 
in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, 
called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them 
back to the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing
new, healthy blood cells. Just a small population 
of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s 
worth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant 
can also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells 
generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s 
original immune system couldn’t. This phenomenon can help eradicate 
stubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants 
also come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease. It happens when the immune system 
generated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs. This life-threatening condition 
occurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells 
from anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells 
are collected from the blood 
as opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take 
immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed 
from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk 
of graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient 
avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system 
may reject the donor cells. So it’s crucial to find the best match 
possible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic code 
determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are similar 
in the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system 
is more likely to accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, 
the best matches are often siblings. But many patients 
who need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member. Those patients 
turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is 
a cheek swab to test for a genetic match. And in many cases, 
the donation itself isn’t much more complicated 
than giving blood. It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource 
that’s completely renewable.

**Transcript**:
The Vikings came from the rugged, 
inhospitable north known today as Scandinavia. As the Roman Empire 
flourished further south, Scandinavians had small settlements, 
no central government, and no coinage. Yet by the 11th century, the Vikings 
had spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes 
throughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and even building outposts 
in North America. The secret to their success 
was their ships. The formidable Viking longship had its origins 
in the humble dugout canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia 
had used these canoes for transportation. Dense forests and tall mountains 
made overland travel difficult, but long coastlines 
and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out 
logs rowed with paddles. Over time, they added planks 
to the log boat base using the clinker, 
or "lapstrake," technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other 
along their edges. As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians 
served in their new neighbors’ armies— and brought home 
Roman maritime technology. The Mediterranean cultures 
at the heart of the Roman Empire had large warships 
that controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods 
along the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and relied on a strong skeleton 
of internal timbers fastened to the outer planks 
with copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians 
incorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles 
with anchored oars. This change 
hugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but also required stronger ships. So boat builders began to use iron nails 
for fasteners rather than sewing. They abandoned 
the log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats became higher 
and more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the concept
of the original log boat: their strength 
depended on the outer shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells— 
thin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships. Competing chieftains quickly refined 
the new ships to be even more efficient. The lighter the boat, 
the more versatile it would be and the less investment of resources 
it would require— an essential advantage 
in a decentralized culture without large supplies of people. These ships still had no sails— 
sails were costly, and for now the rowed ships 
could meet their needs. That changed 
after the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century. Western Europe 
took a heavy economic blow, leveling the playing field a bit 
for the Scandinavians. As the region revived, new and vigorous trade routes 
extended into and through Scandinavia. The wealth that flowed along these routes helped create a new, more prosperous 
and powerful class of Scandinavians, whose members 
competed constantly with each other over trade routes and territory. By the 8th century, 
a sailing ship began to make sense: it could go further, faster, 
in search of newly available plunder. With the addition of sails, the already light and speedy ships 
became nearly unbeatable. The Viking ship was born. Viking longships could soon carry 
as many as 100 Vikings to battle. Fleets of them 
could land on open beaches, penetrate deep into river systems, 
and be moved over land if need be. When not at war, the vessels were used to transport goods 
and make trade journeys. There were smaller versions 
for fishing and local excursions, and larger adaptations 
for open sea voyages capable of carrying 
tens of tons of cargo. Thanks to their inventiveness 
in the face of difficult terrain and weak economies, 
the Vikings sailed west, settled the North Atlantic 
and explored the North American coast centuries before any other Europeans 
would set foot there.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 5: What significant change did the Scandinavians make to their ships after incorporating Roman maritime technology, which improved the crew's efficiency?**

However, the correct generated MCQ should directly mention learning new shipbuilding technology from another culture. Among the provided options, the closest match is:

**Question 5 does not directly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 5 does mention "incorporating Roman maritime technology."**

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about learning new shipbuilding technology from another culture. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided options.

However, if we were to choose the closest match based on the mention of "Roman maritime technology," it would be Question 5.

But since the original ground truth MCQ specifically asks about "They learned new shipbuilding technology from:", a more accurate match can be found in the content of Question 5's explanation in the transcript: 

"...some Scandinavians served in their new neighbors' armies— and brought home Roman maritime technology."

Given the provided options and the explanation above, the closest match is:

**Question 5**

However, I must emphasize that this is not an exact match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none directly match the ground truth MCQ's intent. However, I can suggest an alternative approach.

Considering the context and content of the generated MCQs, I can try to find a question that might be related to the ground truth MCQ's topic.

In this case, I would recommend:

**Question 2: What was the primary factor that contributed to the Vikings' success in spreading throughout Europe and beyond?**

has an option that mentions "Their advanced maritime technology, specifically the Viking longship." However, the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ is "The Romans." 

Given this new information, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ's intent and options.**

However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the mention of "Roman" or "maritime technology," I would select:

**Question 5**

Again, I want to emphasize that this is not an exact match.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ's intent and options.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent and options.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

However, if you still want me to choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but with significant reservations due to the lack of a direct match.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ asks about the dominant geographical features of the Vikings' homelands. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 1, which asks about the region the Vikings originated from, characterized by rugged terrain and inhospitable climate. However, this question does not directly address the dominant geographical features of their homelands.

A more suitable match is not found among the generated MCQs, as none of them directly ask about the dominant geographical features of the Vikings' homelands. However, if we were to choose the closest match based on the content, it would be Question 1.

But since it's not a perfect match, let's re-examine the generated MCQs. Question 1 mentions the region's characteristics but does not specifically ask about the dominant geographical features. 

However, the transcript does mention that "Dense forests and tall mountains made overland travel difficult, but long coastlines and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative." This information is related to the ground truth MCQ.

With this in mind, a more suitable match is still not found among the generated MCQs. However, the closest match based on content would be Question 1, which mentions the region's characteristics.

**Transcript**:
The Vikings came from the rugged, 
inhospitable north known today as Scandinavia. As the Roman Empire 
flourished further south, Scandinavians had small settlements, 
no central government, and no coinage. Yet by the 11th century, the Vikings 
had spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes 
throughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and even building outposts 
in North America. The secret to their success 
was their ships. The formidable Viking longship had its origins 
in the humble dugout canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia 
had used these canoes for transportation. Dense forests and tall mountains 
made overland travel difficult, but long coastlines 
and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out 
logs rowed with paddles. Over time, they added planks 
to the log boat base using the clinker, 
or "lapstrake," technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other 
along their edges. As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians 
served in their new neighbors’ armies— and brought home 
Roman maritime technology. The Mediterranean cultures 
at the heart of the Roman Empire had large warships 
that controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods 
along the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and relied on a strong skeleton 
of internal timbers fastened to the outer planks 
with copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians 
incorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles 
with anchored oars. This change 
hugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but also required stronger ships. So boat builders began to use iron nails 
for fasteners rather than sewing. They abandoned 
the log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats became higher 
and more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the concept
of the original log boat: their strength 
depended on the outer shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells— 
thin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships. Competing chieftains quickly refined 
the new ships to be even more efficient. The lighter the boat, 
the more versatile it would be and the less investment of resources 
it would require— an essential advantage 
in a decentralized culture without large supplies of people. These ships still had no sails— 
sails were costly, and for now the rowed ships 
could meet their needs. That changed 
after the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century. Western Europe 
took a heavy economic blow, leveling the playing field a bit 
for the Scandinavians. As the region revived, new and vigorous trade routes 
extended into and through Scandinavia. The wealth that flowed along these routes helped create a new, more prosperous 
and powerful class of Scandinavians, whose members 
competed constantly with each other over trade routes and territory. By the 8th century, 
a sailing ship began to make sense: it could go further, faster, 
in search of newly available plunder. With the addition of sails, the already light and speedy ships 
became nearly unbeatable. The Viking ship was born. Viking longships could soon carry 
as many as 100 Vikings to battle. Fleets of them 
could land on open beaches, penetrate deep into river systems, 
and be moved over land if need be. When not at war, the vessels were used to transport goods 
and make trade journeys. There were smaller versions 
for fishing and local excursions, and larger adaptations 
for open sea voyages capable of carrying 
tens of tons of cargo. Thanks to their inventiveness 
in the face of difficult terrain and weak economies, 
the Vikings sailed west, settled the North Atlantic 
and explored the North American coast centuries before any other Europeans 
would set foot there.

**Transcript**:
It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall, and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there. At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight. But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants, called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings— creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight 
in the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though— returning their mother 
to good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies. These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins. Workers from nests 
up to several meters away begin to steal offspring 
from our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders 
from even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile. Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer, and returns to worker production 
in the fall. After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood, while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home, the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually, they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: After mating, female alates:
Options: A. join with males to start a new colony together., B. mated females start a new colony with the help of workers they have brought with them., C. start a new colony by themselves or with other females., D. leave the new nest occasionally to forage for food.
Correct Option: C

**Transcript**:
It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall, and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there. At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight. But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants, called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings— creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight 
in the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though— returning their mother 
to good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies. These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins. Workers from nests 
up to several meters away begin to steal offspring 
from our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders 
from even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile. Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer, and returns to worker production 
in the fall. After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood, while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home, the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually, they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.

**Transcript**:
It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall, and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there. At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight. But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants, called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings— creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight 
in the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though— returning their mother 
to good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies. These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins. Workers from nests 
up to several meters away begin to steal offspring 
from our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders 
from even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile. Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer, and returns to worker production 
in the fall. After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood, while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home, the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually, they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.

**Transcript**:
We typically think of ballet 
as harmonious, graceful and polished– hardly features that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance 
of Igor Stravinsky’s "The Rite of Spring," audience members were so outraged 
that they drowned out the orchestra. Accounts of the event include 
people hurling objects at the stage, challenging each other to fights, 
and getting arrested– all on what started 
as a sophisticated night at the ballet. First performed in May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées 
in Paris, "The Rite of Spring" 
is set in prehistoric times. The narrative follows 
an ancient Pagan community worshipping the Earth 
and preparing for the sacrifice of a woman intended to bring about 
the change of seasons. But the ballet is much more 
concerned with the violent relationship between humans, nature, and culture than with character or plot. These themes manifest 
in a truly upsetting production which combines harsh music, 
jerky dancing, and uncanny staging. It opens with dancers 
awakening to a solo bassoon, playing in an eerily high register. This gives way to discordant strings, 
punctured by unexpected pauses while the dancers twitch to the music. These frightening figures 
enact the ballet’s brutal premise, which set audiences on edge and shattered the conventions 
of classical music. In these ways and many more, "The Rite of Spring" 
challenged the orchestral traditions of the 19th century. Composed on the cusp 
of both the first World War and the Russian revolution, "The Rite of Spring" seethes with urgency. This tension is reflected 
in various formal experiments, including innovative uses of syncopation, 
or irregular rhythm; atonality or the lack of a single key, and the presence 
of multiple time signatures. Alongside these 
strikingly modern features, Stravinsky spliced in aspects 
of Russian folk music– a combination that deliberately disrupted the expectations of his sophisticated, 
urban audience. This wasn’t Stravinsky’s 
first use of folk music. Born in a small town 
outside of St. Petersburg in 1882, Stravinsky’s reputation was cemented 
with the lush ballet "The Firebird." Based on a Russian fairytale, this production 
was steeped in Stravinsky’s fascination with folk culture. But he plotted a wilder project 
in "The Rite of Spring," pushing folk and musical boundaries 
to draw out the rawness of pagan ritual. Stravinsky brought this reverie to life in collaboration 
with artist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was obsessed 
with prehistoric times. He had published essays 
about human sacrifice and worked on excavations 
of Slavic tombs in addition to set and costume design. For "The Rite of Spring," 
he drew from Russian medieval art and peasant garments to create costumes 
that hung awkwardly on the dancers’ bodies. Roerich set them against vivid backdrops 
of primeval nature; full of jagged rocks, looming trees 
and nightmarish colors. Along with its dazzling sets 
and searing score, the original choreography 
for "The Rite of Spring" was highly provocative. This was the doing 
of legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who developed dances 
to rethink “the roots of movement itself.” Although Stravinsky 
later expressed frustration with Nijinsky’s demanding rehearsals and single-minded interpretations 
of the music, his choreography proved 
as pioneering as Stravinsky’s composition. He contorted traditional ballet– to both the awe and horror 
of his audience, many of whom expected 
the refinement and romance of the genre. The dancing in "The Rite of Spring" 
is agitated and uneven, with performers cowering, writhing 
and leaping about as if possessed. Often, the dancers are not one 
with the music but rather seem to struggle against it. Nijinsky instructed them 
to turn their toes inwards and land heavily after jumps,
often off the beat. For the final, frenzied scene, a woman dances herself to death 
to loud bangs and jarring strings. The ballet ends abruptly on a harsh, 
haunting chord. Today, "The Rite of Spring" remains as chilling 
as its controversial debut, but the shockwaves of the original work
continue to resound and inspire. You can hear Stravinsky’s influence 
in modern jazz’s dueling rhythms, folky classical music, 
and even film scores for horror movies, which still illicit 
a riotous audience response.

of multiple time signatures. Alongside these 
strikingly modern features, Stravinsky spliced in aspects 
of Russian folk music– a combination that deliberately disrupted the expectations of his sophisticated, 
urban audience. This wasn’t Stravinsky’s 
first use of folk music. Born in a small town 
outside of St. Petersburg in 1882, Stravinsky’s reputation was cemented 
with the lush ballet "The Firebird." Based on a Russian fairytale, this production 
was steeped in Stravinsky’s fascination with folk culture. But he plotted a wilder project 
in "The Rite of Spring," pushing folk and musical boundaries 
to draw out the rawness of pagan ritual. Stravinsky brought this reverie to life in collaboration 
with artist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was obsessed 
with prehistoric times. He had published essays 
about human sacrifice and worked on excavations 
of Slavic tombs in addition to set and costume design. For "The Rite of Spring," 
he drew from Russian medieval art and peasant garments to create costumes 
that hung awkwardly on the dancers’ bodies. Roerich set them against vivid backdrops 
of primeval nature; full of jagged rocks, looming trees 
and nightmarish colors. Along with its dazzling sets 
and searing score, the original choreography 
for "The Rite of Spring" was highly provocative. This was the doing 
of legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who developed dances 
to rethink “the roots of movement itself.” Although Stravinsky 
later expressed frustration with Nijinsky’s demanding rehearsals and single-minded interpretations 
of the music, his choreography proved 
as pioneering as Stravinsky’s composition. He contorted traditional ballet– to both the awe and horror 
of his audience, many of whom expected 
the refinement and romance of the genre. The dancing in "The Rite of Spring" 
is agitated and uneven, with performers cowering, writhing 
and leaping about as if possessed. Often, the dancers are not one 
with the music but rather seem to struggle against it. Nijinsky instructed them 
to turn their toes inwards and land heavily after jumps,
often off the beat. For the final, frenzied scene, a woman dances herself to death 
to loud bangs and jarring strings. The ballet ends abruptly on a harsh, 
haunting chord. Today, "The Rite of Spring" remains as chilling 
as its controversial debut, but the shockwaves of the original work
continue to resound and inspire. You can hear Stravinsky’s influence 
in modern jazz’s dueling rhythms, folky classical music, 
and even film scores for horror movies, which still illicit 
a riotous audience response.

**Transcript**:
We typically think of ballet 
as harmonious, graceful and polished– hardly features that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance 
of Igor Stravinsky’s "The Rite of Spring," audience members were so outraged 
that they drowned out the orchestra. Accounts of the event include 
people hurling objects at the stage, challenging each other to fights, 
and getting arrested– all on what started 
as a sophisticated night at the ballet. First performed in May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées 
in Paris, "The Rite of Spring" 
is set in prehistoric times. The narrative follows 
an ancient Pagan community worshipping the Earth 
and preparing for the sacrifice of a woman intended to bring about 
the change of seasons. But the ballet is much more 
concerned with the violent relationship between humans, nature, and culture than with character or plot. These themes manifest 
in a truly upsetting production which combines harsh music, 
jerky dancing, and uncanny staging. It opens with dancers 
awakening to a solo bassoon, playing in an eerily high register. This gives way to discordant strings, 
punctured by unexpected pauses while the dancers twitch to the music. These frightening figures 
enact the ballet’s brutal premise, which set audiences on edge and shattered the conventions 
of classical music. In these ways and many more, "The Rite of Spring" 
challenged the orchestral traditions of the 19th century. Composed on the cusp 
of both the first World War and the Russian revolution, "The Rite of Spring" seethes with urgency. This tension is reflected 
in various formal experiments, including innovative uses of syncopation, 
or irregular rhythm; atonality or the lack of a single key, and the presence

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the final scene of "The Rite of Spring," and the correct option is "A woman dancing herself to death." While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 5 mentions the choreography of Vaslav Nijinsky and how it differed from traditional ballet, including the fact that "the dancers are not one with the music but rather seem to struggle against it" and that "a woman dances herself to death to loud bangs and jarring strings" is mentioned in the transcript as part of the description of the final scene.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ is not available. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, although it does not directly ask about the final scene.

**Transcript**:
After centuries of war, the world’s kingdoms 
have come to an agreement. Every five years, teams representing 
the elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament 
of dragon jousting. Every team will face 
each of the others once. The kingdom whose team wins the most 
matches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament. To prevent any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted 
in absolute secret except for a group of wizards 
who will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, 
or spells to cheat. You’ve been given the extremely 
important job of recording the scores for the first inaugural tournament. But the opening celebrations 
get a bit out of control, and when you wake up, you realize the games 
are already underway. Fortunately, no one has noticed 
your absence so far. However, you need to get up to speed 
quickly; if your boss, 
the head tournament official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job,
you’ll lose your head. After weighing your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings 
to one of the regulation wizards in return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard 
to fill out. But before he can finish, 
your boss walks into the tent. You barely manage to hide the scorecard 
in time, and the wizard excuses himself. Your boss chuckles. “Hope you didn’t believe anything 
Gorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, 
even in writing. Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring 
the tournament’s been? Every team has played at least once, yet not a single match with 
a combined score of more than five hits! Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute 
to review your scorecard.” You laugh along, and when he leaves you look 
at the partially completed card, now knowing every single number 
on it is wrong. You’ve only got one chance 
to save yourself, so what’s the real score of each match? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The incredible thing about this riddle 
is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack 
of correct information. And that’s possible because 
knowing that something is false is meaningful information 
in its own right. The first key is to realize that no team 
will play more than two matches, since there are only two other teams. So if the elves didn’t actually play 
one match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two, the truth must be that elves played two 
and goblins played one. For the elves to have played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams
once. And since goblins have only played 
one match so far— against the elves— that means the match between goblins 
and treefolk has not occurred yet. We know it’s false that the treefolk tied 
zero matches, which means their bout 
against the elves must’ve tied. We also know that the elves won 
at least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, 
they must have beaten the goblins. But can we figure out the actual scores? Let’s start with the elf-treefolk tie. Because no more than five total hits 
were scored, the final tally must’ve been 
0-0, 1-1, or 2-2. But the treefolk must’ve scored 
some hits, and it’s false that they only had one hit 
scored against them. The only option that leaves is 2-2. In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins must’ve scored 
at least one hit. And the elf score must be 2 or more 
for them to have won the match. This leaves only a few possibilities 
that add up to 5 or less. The elves couldn’t have scored three, 
so that eliminates these two. And their total hits scored 
across both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too. So the score must’ve been 2-1. With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— 
and your neck. Gorbak the wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills 
quickly evened the score.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the likely ultimate winner of the tournament, and the correct option is the Elves. Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most relevant, as it asks about the score of the match between the Elves and the Goblins, and the correct option indicates that the Elves won the match.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question intent, I would suggest Question 6. This question asks about the number of matches played by each team, and the correct option indicates that the Elves played two matches and the Goblins played one. This information can be indirectly related to the likelihood of the Elves being the ultimate winner of the tournament.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Generated MCQ 7: What is the outcome of the match between the elves and the treefolk?** is not the most similar, however **Generated MCQ 6** contains information that can be used to infer the answer to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more direct match would be a question that asks which match has not occurred yet. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question.

That being said, the most similar generated MCQ that provides information to infer the answer to the ground truth MCQ is:

**Generated MCQ 6: If the elves did not actually play one match, and the goblins did not actually play two, what must be the truth about the number of matches played by each team?**

From this question, we can infer that the goblins have played only one match, which was against the elves. Therefore, the match between the goblins and the treefolk has not occurred yet.

So, while there isn't a direct match, I would argue that **Generated MCQ 6** is the most similar generated MCQ that provides information to answer the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the story's context.

The ground truth MCQ asks about why the narrator missed the early matches, and the correct option is "Too much celebrating the night before." While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, I found that Question 3 is somewhat related, as it asks about the narrator's action (offering his life's savings to a wizard) that is a consequence of missing the early matches.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and context, I would suggest:

 Question 3 is not the best match, a better match is not available.

However a question that talks about the "celebration" can be Question:  "Why did the narrator miss the early matches?"  A possible generated question could be: 
What caused the narrator to wake up late and miss the start of the tournament? 
Options: A) The narrator was under a sleeping curse, B) Too much celebrating the night before, C) The narrator was exhausted from preparing for the tournament.

Unfortunately this is not one of the generated questions, but  Question 3: Why does the narrator offer his life's savings to one of the regulation wizards? is the closest we have.

**Transcript**:
After centuries of war, the world’s kingdoms 
have come to an agreement. Every five years, teams representing 
the elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament 
of dragon jousting. Every team will face 
each of the others once. The kingdom whose team wins the most 
matches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament. To prevent any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted 
in absolute secret except for a group of wizards 
who will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, 
or spells to cheat. You’ve been given the extremely 
important job of recording the scores for the first inaugural tournament. But the opening celebrations 
get a bit out of control, and when you wake up, you realize the games 
are already underway. Fortunately, no one has noticed 
your absence so far. However, you need to get up to speed 
quickly; if your boss, 
the head tournament official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job,
you’ll lose your head. After weighing your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings 
to one of the regulation wizards in return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard 
to fill out. But before he can finish, 
your boss walks into the tent. You barely manage to hide the scorecard 
in time, and the wizard excuses himself. Your boss chuckles. “Hope you didn’t believe anything 
Gorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, 
even in writing. Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring 
the tournament’s been? Every team has played at least once, yet not a single match with 
a combined score of more than five hits! Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute 
to review your scorecard.” You laugh along, and when he leaves you look 
at the partially completed card, now knowing every single number 
on it is wrong. You’ve only got one chance 
to save yourself, so what’s the real score of each match? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The incredible thing about this riddle 
is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack 
of correct information. And that’s possible because 
knowing that something is false is meaningful information 
in its own right. The first key is to realize that no team 
will play more than two matches, since there are only two other teams. So if the elves didn’t actually play 
one match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two, the truth must be that elves played two 
and goblins played one. For the elves to have played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams
once. And since goblins have only played 
one match so far— against the elves— that means the match between goblins 
and treefolk has not occurred yet. We know it’s false that the treefolk tied 
zero matches, which means their bout 
against the elves must’ve tied. We also know that the elves won 
at least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, 
they must have beaten the goblins. But can we figure out the actual scores? Let’s start with the elf-treefolk tie. Because no more than five total hits 
were scored, the final tally must’ve been 
0-0, 1-1, or 2-2. But the treefolk must’ve scored 
some hits, and it’s false that they only had one hit 
scored against them. The only option that leaves is 2-2. In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins must’ve scored 
at least one hit. And the elf score must be 2 or more 
for them to have won the match. This leaves only a few possibilities 
that add up to 5 or less. The elves couldn’t have scored three, 
so that eliminates these two. And their total hits scored 
across both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too. So the score must’ve been 2-1. With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— 
and your neck. Gorbak the wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills 
quickly evened the score.

**Transcript**:
The night before the Death Race 
across the Wastelands is set to begin, your uncle, 
the great inventor Slate Kanoli, got kidnapped 
by the ruthless No-Side gang. The only way to get him back 
is to race his Coil Runner against the gang yourself. Win and they’ll give back your uncle. Lose and you’ll forfeit the Coil Runner 
and all his other creations. As the grueling race gets underway, you find yourself falling further 
and further behind. Your only chance is to take a shortcut 
your uncle told you about–– the Flux Ravine gambit. Fortunately, the Coil Runner comes 
equipped with emergency turbo thrusters. Unfortunately, your uncle 
was a notorious tinkerer, and the system still had some kinks 
to work out. Just minor things 
like the ignition exploding, the reactor leaking, 
or the oxygen levels depleting— any of which would end 
your racing career immediately. Before his kidnapping, Uncle Slate determined 
that each of these critical failures was the ultimate result 
of a chain reaction originating in the thrusters. He was also certain that while one factor
could trigger two different effects, and two factors could each independently
lead to the same effect, no effect is caused by two factors 
in conjunction. However, Uncle Slate 
never got around to pinpointing which thruster was responsible 
for which error. All you have 
are the notes from his test runs: 1. When thrusters B and C are on, 
the Fuel gauge glows. 2.	When thrusters A, B, and D are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Helium tank rattles. 3.	When thrusters C, D, and E are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins. 4.	When thrusters A, D, and E are on, the Gravitometer spins 
and the Helium tank rattles. 5.	Shortly after the Helium tank rattles 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Ignition explodes 
and the Oxygen levels deplete. 6.	Shortly after the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Reactor leaks. You need to use 
as many thrusters as possible to give yourself the best chance 
at clearing the gap, without triggering any of the three 
catastrophic failures. Which thrusters should you activate? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The most important thing 
to remember here is that even if we know 
that one thing causes another, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, this panic switch 
shuts off the coil runner’s engine. But the engine being off 
doesn’t necessarily mean the panic switch was engaged— the coil runner could be 
out of fuel, or damaged— or turned off normally. We can, however, 
conclude that if the engine is running, the panic switch hasn’t been engaged. With that in mind, one way we can start 
is to work backwards from the three defects that could 
knock you out of the race. So let’s look at Slate’s last two notes, since they give direct information 
about those. The Gravitometer spins in both cases, 
but the results are different. That means the spinning Gravitometer can’t be the cause 
of any particular malfunction. If it were, the same thing would happen 
each time. So we can conclude that a glowing 
Fuel gauge makes the reactor leak, while a rattling Helium tank 
makes the Ignition explode and depletes the Oxygen levels. Once we know which two errors 
we need to avoid, we can make a table 
and use the logic of cause and effect to see which thrusters trigger them. Since the Helium tank is fine 
during the first test run when thrusters B and C are active, we can assume neither makes it rattle. And from the third run 
we know that D and E don’t either. That leaves thruster A, which was indeed used 
in the second and fourth test runs where the Helium tank rattled. Now what causes the glowing Fuel gauge? From the fourth test run we know 
it can’t be thrusters A, D, or E. So is the culprit, B, C, 
or each of them separately? The answer can be found 
in the second and third test runs: the fuel tank glowed in both, 
but B was activated in one, and C in the other. That means the B and C thrusters each 
independently make the Fuel tank glow. It looks like the A, B, and C 
thrusters are off limits. Fortunately, the other two 
are just enough to clear the jump. You rocket into first place and the gang 
begrudgingly hands over your uncle. He thanks you profusely, 
and decides to celebrate your victory with a cup of tea

**Transcript**:
The night before the Death Race 
across the Wastelands is set to begin, your uncle, 
the great inventor Slate Kanoli, got kidnapped 
by the ruthless No-Side gang. The only way to get him back 
is to race his Coil Runner against the gang yourself. Win and they’ll give back your uncle. Lose and you’ll forfeit the Coil Runner 
and all his other creations. As the grueling race gets underway, you find yourself falling further 
and further behind. Your only chance is to take a shortcut 
your uncle told you about–– the Flux Ravine gambit. Fortunately, the Coil Runner comes 
equipped with emergency turbo thrusters. Unfortunately, your uncle 
was a notorious tinkerer, and the system still had some kinks 
to work out. Just minor things 
like the ignition exploding, the reactor leaking, 
or the oxygen levels depleting— any of which would end 
your racing career immediately. Before his kidnapping, Uncle Slate determined 
that each of these critical failures was the ultimate result 
of a chain reaction originating in the thrusters. He was also certain that while one factor
could trigger two different effects, and two factors could each independently
lead to the same effect, no effect is caused by two factors 
in conjunction. However, Uncle Slate 
never got around to pinpointing which thruster was responsible 
for which error. All you have 
are the notes from his test runs: 1. When thrusters B and C are on, 
the Fuel gauge glows. 2.	When thrusters A, B, and D are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Helium tank rattles. 3.	When thrusters C, D, and E are on, the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins. 4.	When thrusters A, D, and E are on, the Gravitometer spins 
and the Helium tank rattles. 5.	Shortly after the Helium tank rattles 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Ignition explodes 
and the Oxygen levels deplete. 6.	Shortly after the Fuel gauge glows 
and the Gravitometer spins, the Reactor leaks. You need to use 
as many thrusters as possible to give yourself the best chance 
at clearing the gap, without triggering any of the three 
catastrophic failures. Which thrusters should you activate? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The most important thing 
to remember here is that even if we know 
that one thing causes another, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, this panic switch 
shuts off the coil runner’s engine. But the engine being off 
doesn’t necessarily mean the panic switch was engaged— the coil runner could be 
out of fuel, or damaged— or turned off normally. We can, however, 
conclude that if the engine is running, the panic switch hasn’t been engaged. With that in mind, one way we can start 
is to work backwards from the three defects that could 
knock you out of the race. So let’s look at Slate’s last two notes, since they give direct information 
about those. The Gravitometer spins in both cases, 
but the results are different. That means the spinning Gravitometer can’t be the cause 
of any particular malfunction. If it were, the same thing would happen 
each time. So we can conclude that a glowing 
Fuel gauge makes the reactor leak, while a rattling Helium tank 
makes the Ignition explode and depletes the Oxygen levels. Once we know which two errors 
we need to avoid, we can make a table 
and use the logic of cause and effect to see which thrusters trigger them. Since the Helium tank is fine 
during the first test run when thrusters B and C are active, we can assume neither makes it rattle. And from the third run 
we know that D and E don’t either. That leaves thruster A, which was indeed used 
in the second and fourth test runs where the Helium tank rattled. Now what causes the glowing Fuel gauge? From the fourth test run we know 
it can’t be thrusters A, D, or E. So is the culprit, B, C, 
or each of them separately? The answer can be found 
in the second and third test runs: the fuel tank glowed in both, 
but B was activated in one, and C in the other. That means the B and C thrusters each 
independently make the Fuel tank glow. It looks like the A, B, and C 
thrusters are off limits. Fortunately, the other two 
are just enough to clear the jump. You rocket into first place and the gang 
begrudgingly hands over your uncle. He thanks you profusely, 
and decides to celebrate your victory with a cup of tea 
from his latest contraption...

**Transcript**:
A new drug reduces 
the risk of heart attacks by 40%. Shark attacks are up by a factor of two. Drinking a liter of soda per day 
doubles your chance of developing cancer. These are all examples of relative risk, a common way risk 
is presented in news articles. Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle 
of statistical thinking and personal preference. One common stumbling block 
is the difference between relative risks like these 
and what are called absolute risks. Risk is the likelihood 
that an event will occur. It can be expressed 
as either a percentage— for example, that heart attacks 
occur in 11% of men between the ages of 60 and 79— or as a rate— that one in two million 
divers along Australia’s western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year. These numbers express 
the absolute risk of heart attacks and shark attacks in these groups. Changes in risk can be expressed 
in relative or absolute terms. For example, a review in 2009 
found that mammography screenings reduced the number of breast cancer deaths
from five women in one thousand to four. The absolute risk reduction 
was about .1%. But the relative risk reduction 
from 5 cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%. Based on reports of this higher number, people overestimated 
the impact of screening. To see why the difference between 
the two ways of expressing risk matters, let’s consider 
the hypothetical example of a drug that reduces heart attack risk by 40%. Imagine that out of a group 
of 1,000 people who didn’t take the new drug, 
10 would have heart attacks. The absolute risk 
is 10 out of 1,000, or 1%. If a similar group of 1,000 people 
did take the drug, the number of heart attacks would be six. In other words, the drug could prevent 
four out of ten heart attacks— a relative risk reduction of 40%. Meanwhile, the absolute risk 
only dropped from 1% to 0.6%— but the 40% relative risk decrease 
sounds a lot more significant. Surely preventing 
even a handful of heart attacks, or any other negative outcome, 
is worthwhile— isn’t it? Not necessarily. The problem is that choices 
that reduce some risks can put you in the path of others. Suppose the heart-attack drug caused 
cancer in one half of 1% of patients. In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks 
would be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be 
five new cases of cancer. The relative reduction 
in heart attack risk sounds substantial and the absolute risk of cancer 
sounds small, but they work out 
to about the same number of cases. In real life, everyone’s individual evaluation of risk 
will vary depending on 
their personal circumstances. If you know you have a family history 
of heart disease you might be more strongly motivated 
to take a medication that would lower your heart-attack risk, even knowing it provided 
only a small reduction in absolute risk. Sometimes, we have to decide between 
exposing ourselves to risks that aren’t directly comparable. If, for example, the heart attack drug 
carried a higher risk of a debilitating, 
but not life-threatening, side effect like migraines 
rather than cancer, our evaluation of whether that risk 
is worth taking might change. And sometimes there isn’t necessarily 
a correct choice: some might say even a minuscule risk 
of shark attack is worth avoiding, because all you’d miss out on 
is an ocean swim, while others wouldn’t even consider 
skipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk 
of shark attack. For all these reasons, 
risk evaluation is tricky at baseline, and reporting on risk can be misleading, especially when it shares some numbers 
in absolute terms and others in relative terms. Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through 
some of the confusion and better evaluate risk.

**Transcript**:
A new drug reduces 
the risk of heart attacks by 40%. Shark attacks are up by a factor of two. Drinking a liter of soda per day 
doubles your chance of developing cancer. These are all examples of relative risk, a common way risk 
is presented in news articles. Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle 
of statistical thinking and personal preference. One common stumbling block 
is the difference between relative risks like these 
and what are called absolute risks. Risk is the likelihood 
that an event will occur. It can be expressed 
as either a percentage— for example, that heart attacks 
occur in 11% of men between the ages of 60 and 79— or as a rate— that one in two million 
divers along Australia’s western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year. These numbers express 
the absolute risk of heart attacks and shark attacks in these groups. Changes in risk can be expressed 
in relative or absolute terms. For example, a review in 2009 
found that mammography screenings reduced the number of breast cancer deaths
from five women in one thousand to four. The absolute risk reduction 
was about .1%. But the relative risk reduction 
from 5 cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%. Based on reports of this higher number, people overestimated 
the impact of screening. To see why the difference between 
the two ways of expressing risk matters, let’s consider 
the hypothetical example of a drug that reduces heart attack risk by 40%. Imagine that out of a group 
of 1,000 people who didn’t take the new drug, 
10 would have heart attacks. The absolute risk 
is 10 out of 1,000, or 1%. If a similar group of 1,000 people 
did take the drug, the number of heart attacks would be six. In other words, the drug could prevent 
four out of ten heart attacks— a relative risk reduction of 40%. Meanwhile, the absolute risk 
only dropped from 1% to 0.6%— but the 40% relative risk decrease 
sounds a lot more significant. Surely preventing 
even a handful of heart attacks, or any other negative outcome, 
is worthwhile— isn’t it? Not necessarily. The problem is that choices 
that reduce some risks can put you in the path of others. Suppose the heart-attack drug caused 
cancer in one half of 1% of patients. In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks 
would be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be 
five new cases of cancer. The relative reduction 
in heart attack risk sounds substantial and the absolute risk of cancer 
sounds small, but they work out 
to about the same number of cases. In real life, everyone’s individual evaluation of risk 
will vary depending on 
their personal circumstances. If you know you have a family history 
of heart disease you might be more strongly motivated 
to take a medication that would lower your heart-attack risk, even knowing it provided 
only a small reduction in absolute risk. Sometimes, we have to decide between 
exposing ourselves to risks that aren’t directly comparable. If, for example, the heart attack drug 
carried a higher risk of a debilitating, 
but not life-threatening, side effect like migraines 
rather than cancer, our evaluation of whether that risk 
is worth taking might change. And sometimes there isn’t necessarily 
a correct choice: some might say even a minuscule risk 
of shark attack is worth avoiding, because all you’d miss out on 
is an ocean swim, while others wouldn’t even consider 
skipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk 
of shark attack. For all these reasons, 
risk evaluation is tricky at baseline, and reporting on risk can be misleading, especially when it shares some numbers 
in absolute terms and others in relative terms. Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through 
some of the confusion and better evaluate risk.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In the 1970s, the Mexican government had a problem: the capacity of the Viaducto (a highway with two lanes on each side) was too small, but the government did not have the necessary resources. But they had a brilliant idea: to buy paint, and repaint the highway in order to make three lanes out of two. That effort resulted increased the capacity by 50%. Unfortunately, the smaller lanes lead to a substantial increase of deadly traffic accidents. So the government once again bought paint, and repainted the highways, from three to two lanes. That decreased the capacity by 33%. At the end, it was announced that all these efforts had increased the capacity by 17%. Is there anything wrong with this announcement?
Options: A. It is not correct to add up relative increases and reductions., B. It is not correct to add up absolute increases and reductions., C. Nothing is wrong, except that the government did not report the costs of the paint., D. Nothing is wrong, the government had a magical idea.

**Transcript**:
In the 8th century CE, 
Vikings surged across the misty seas. They came from Scandinavia 
in Northern Europe but would travel far and wide. Some plundered and settled 
in the British Isles and France; others braved Artic exploration or forged clever new trade routes 
to the Middle East. With their steely navigational skills, 
advanced long-ships and fearsome tactics, the Vikings sustained their seafaring 
for over three hundred years. But for all their might, 
they left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone, 
bark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Found in graves, bogs, 
and sites of ancient settlements, many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse 
written in runic letters. But the Vikings also scratched runes
into household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes. Deciphering these messages 
is no easy task. Runes are short, straight, 
and diagonal lines that make up an alphabet 
called the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote 
this language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, 
they wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds 
of their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore 
the influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,”
for example, is originally a Latin phrase 
from the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, 
were carved in verse, highlighting the tradition 
of Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists 
can read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining 
mysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories 
have been deciphered— along with some 
containing magical incantations. The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved 
on a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground. This causeway was commissioned 
by a prominent local woman named Sigríðr. She proclaimed both her importance 
and her family’s power by carving their names in stone, and even associated herself 
and her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of Sigurd 
the dragon slayer. In the town of Jelling in Denmark, two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations
of a royal family. The first was erected by King Gorm the Old
in memory of his Queen Thyrvi, and the second by their son, 
Harald Bluetooth, after Gorm’s death. The stones announce the power 
of this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical
documents of Denmark. They indicate that Denmark 
was the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled 
southern Norway, and that he converted to Christianity. Today, Harald Bluetooth’s initials 
make up the Bluetooth logo. The 10th century warrior poet Egil 
was a well-known carver of runes. According to poetic accounts, he once 
carved runes on a horn filled with poison, causing the horn to shatter. In another story, Egil saves a young girl’s life 
by placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing runes 
under her pillow. Norse poetry tells of runic spells, 
cast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells 
isn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords,
axes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be 
incantations, riddles, or religious messages. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end
of the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion 
had mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak 
versions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas
into the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing 
at their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup
stone has fearsomely declared 
for a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone
or drags it in memory of another!”

**Transcript**:
In the 8th century CE, 
Vikings surged across the misty seas. They came from Scandinavia 
in Northern Europe but would travel far and wide. Some plundered and settled 
in the British Isles and France; others braved Artic exploration or forged clever new trade routes 
to the Middle East. With their steely navigational skills, 
advanced long-ships and fearsome tactics, the Vikings sustained their seafaring 
for over three hundred years. But for all their might, 
they left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone, 
bark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Found in graves, bogs, 
and sites of ancient settlements, many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse 
written in runic letters. But the Vikings also scratched runes
into household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes. Deciphering these messages 
is no easy task. Runes are short, straight, 
and diagonal lines that make up an alphabet 
called the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote 
this language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, 
they wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds 
of their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore 
the influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,”
for example, is originally a Latin phrase 
from the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, 
were carved in verse, highlighting the tradition 
of Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists 
can read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining 
mysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories 
have been deciphered— along with some 
containing magical incantations. The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved 
on a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground. This causeway was commissioned 
by a prominent local woman named Sigríðr. She proclaimed both her importance 
and her family’s power by carving their names in stone, and even associated herself 
and her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of Sigurd 
the dragon slayer. In the town of Jelling in Denmark, two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations
of a royal family. The first was erected by King Gorm the Old
in memory of his Queen Thyrvi, and the second by their son, 
Harald Bluetooth, after Gorm’s death. The stones announce the power 
of this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical
documents of Denmark. They indicate that Denmark 
was the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled 
southern Norway, and that he converted to Christianity. Today, Harald Bluetooth’s initials 
make up the Bluetooth logo. The 10th century warrior poet Egil 
was a well-known carver of runes. According to poetic accounts, he once 
carved runes on a horn filled with poison, causing the horn to shatter. In another story, Egil saves a young girl’s life 
by placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing runes 
under her pillow. Norse poetry tells of runic spells, 
cast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells 
isn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords,
axes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be 
incantations, riddles, or religious messages. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end
of the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion 
had mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak 
versions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas
into the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing 
at their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup
stone has fearsomely declared 
for a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone
or drags it in memory of another!”

**Transcript**:
In 1881, doctor William Halsted 
rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was hemorrhaging after childbirth. He quickly inserted 
a needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, 
and transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes, 
she began to recover. Halsted didn’t know 
how lucky they’d gotten. His transfusion only worked 
because he and his sister happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, 
even among close relatives. Blood types hadn’t been discovered 
by Halsted’s time, though people had been experimenting 
with transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully. In 1667, a French physician 
named Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique 
on a human. Denis transfused sheep’s blood 
into Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce 
his symptoms. Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits. But after a second transfusion, 
he developed a fever, severe pain in his lower back, 
intense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid. Though nobody knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous 
immune response unfolding inside his body. This immune response starts 
with the production of proteins called antibodies, which distinguish the body’s 
own cells from intruders. They do so by recognizing 
the foreign proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s 
cell membrane. Antibodies latch onto the antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack 
and destroy the foreign cells. The destroyed cells are flushed 
from the body in urine. In extreme cases, 
the massive break down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that 
disrupt the flow of blood to vital organs, overload the kidneys, 
and cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient 
survived the transfusion. But, after other cross-species 
transfusions proved fatal, the procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor 
for several centuries. It wasn’t until 1901 
that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the crucial step in the success 
of human to human blood transfusions. He noticed that when different types 
were mixed together, they formed clots. This happens when antibodies 
latch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump together. But if the donor cells are the same 
blood type as the recipient’s cells, the donor cells won’t be flagged 
for destruction, and won’t form clumps. By 1907, doctors were mixing together small amounts
of blood before transfusing it. If there were no clumps, 
the types were a match. This enabled them 
to save thousands of lives, laying the foundation 
for modern transfusions. Up to this point, all transfusions 
had occurred in real time, directly between two individuals. That’s because blood 
begins to clot almost immediately after coming into contact with air— a defense mechanism to prevent 
excessive blood loss after injury. In 1914, researchers discovered 
that the chemical sodium citrate stopped blood coagulating by removing 
the calcium necessary for clot formation. Citrated blood could be stored 
for later use— the first step in making large scale 
blood transfusions possible. In 1916, a pair of American scientists 
found an even more effective anticoagulant called heparin, which works by 
deactivating enzymes that enable clotting. We still use heparin today. At the same time, American and British researchers

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1881, doctor William Halsted 
rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was hemorrhaging after childbirth. He quickly inserted 
a needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, 
and transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes, 
she began to recover. Halsted didn’t know 
how lucky they’d gotten. His transfusion only worked 
because he and his sister happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, 
even among close relatives. Blood types hadn’t been discovered 
by Halsted’s time, though people had been experimenting 
with transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully. In 1667, a French physician 
named Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique 
on a human. Denis transfused sheep’s blood 
into Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce 
his symptoms. Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits. But after a second transfusion, 
he developed a fever, severe pain in his lower back, 
intense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid. Though nobody knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous 
immune response unfolding inside his body. This immune response starts 
with the production of proteins called antibodies, which distinguish the body’s 
own cells from intruders. They do so by recognizing 
the foreign proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s 
cell membrane. Antibodies latch onto the antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack 
and destroy the foreign cells. The destroyed cells are flushed 
from the body in urine. In extreme cases, 
the massive break down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that 
disrupt the flow of blood to vital organs, overload the kidneys, 
and cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient 
survived the transfusion. But, after other cross-species 
transfusions proved fatal, the procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor 
for several centuries. It wasn’t until 1901 
that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the crucial step in the success 
of human to human blood transfusions. He noticed that when different types 
were mixed together, they formed clots. This happens when antibodies 
latch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump together. But if the donor cells are the same 
blood type as the recipient’s cells, the donor cells won’t be flagged 
for destruction, and won’t form clumps. By 1907, doctors were mixing together small amounts
of blood before transfusing it. If there were no clumps, 
the types were a match. This enabled them 
to save thousands of lives, laying the foundation 
for modern transfusions. Up to this point, all transfusions

**Transcript**:
In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges 
were collapsing all across Europe. Their industrial cables 
frayed during turbulent weather and snapped 
under the weight of their decks. So when a German-American engineer 
named John Roebling proposed building the largest 
and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived 
over New York’s East River, city officials 
were understandably skeptical. But Manhattan 
was increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn 
clogged the river. In February of 1867, the government 
approved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures 
of European bridges, Roebling designed 
a hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by 
central pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal 
for supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model 
also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures 
held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, 
Roebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight 
on its anchor cables. Similar designs had been used 
for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here
dwarfed them all. His new bridge’s deck
spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built
suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope 
would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for 
over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand 
over 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures 
in the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident 
his design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat 
crushed his foot against the dock. Within a month, 
tetanus had claimed his life. Fortunately, John Roebling's son, 
Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. The following year, construction 
on the tower foundations finally began. This first step in construction 
was also the most challenging. Building on the rocky river bed involved 
the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these airtight 
wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped 
pressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks 
allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone 
on top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, 
they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s 
permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons 
were dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, 
the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was 
a mysterious ailment called "the bends." Today, we understand this 
as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be 
an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly claimed the life 
of the chief engineer. Washington survived, 
but was left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again, 
the Roeblings proved indomitable. Washington’s wife Emily 
not only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over 
day-to-day project management. Unfortunately, 
the bridge’s troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget 
and behind schedule. Worse still, it turned out 
the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires. This would have been a fatal flaw 
if not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design. After reinforcing the cables 
with additional wires, they suspended the deck 
piece by piece. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent 
of over 400 million dollars, and the life’s work 
of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge 
finally opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable. Today, the Brooklyn Bridge 
still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic towers 
and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City.

frayed during turbulent weather and snapped 
under the weight of their decks. So when a German-American engineer 
named John Roebling proposed building the largest 
and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived 
over New York’s East River, city officials 
were understandably skeptical. But Manhattan 
was increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn 
clogged the river. In February of 1867, the government 
approved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures 
of European bridges, Roebling designed 
a hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by 
central pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal 
for supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model 
also drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures 
held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, 
Roebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight 
on its anchor cables. Similar designs had been used 
for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here
dwarfed them all. His new bridge’s deck
spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built
suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope 
would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for 
over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand 
over 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures 
in the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident 
his design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat 
crushed his foot against the dock. Within a month, 
tetanus had claimed his life. Fortunately, John Roebling's son, 
Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. The following year, construction 
on the tower foundations finally began. This first step in construction 
was also the most challenging. Building on the rocky river bed involved 
the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these airtight 
wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped 
pressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks 
allowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone 
on top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, 
they filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s 
permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons 
were dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, 
the chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was 
a mysterious ailment called "the bends." Today, we understand this 
as decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be 
an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly claimed the life 
of the chief engineer. Washington survived, 
but was left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again, 
the Roeblings proved indomitable. Washington’s wife Emily 
not only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over 
day-to-day project management. Unfortunately, 
the bridge’s troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget 
and behind schedule. Worse still, it turned out 
the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires. This would have been a fatal flaw 
if not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design. After reinforcing the cables 
with additional wires, they suspended the deck 
piece by piece. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent 
of over 400 million dollars, and the life’s work 
of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge 
finally opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable. Today, the Brooklyn Bridge 
still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic towers 
and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City.

**Transcript**:
London, 1928: a group of mold spores 
surf a breeze through a lab. They drift onto a petri dish, 
and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, 
a Scottish scientist investigating the properties 
of infectious bacteria. At this time, 
Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds 
a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold 
is a zone completely and unexpectedly 
clear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold 
was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species 
in the Penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed 
the antibacterial compound “penicillin.” What Fleming stumbled upon 
was a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold 
constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies 
that might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys 
many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis 
of their cell walls. These walls get their strength 
from a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids, that are constantly being 
broken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the compounds 
that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being 
reconstructed at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates 
the release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell’s structure 
breaks down completely. This two-pronged attack 
is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in petri-dishes, 
our bodies, or elsewhere. It’s not, however, 
harmful to our own cells, because those don’t have cell walls. For a decade or so 
after Fleming’s discovery, penicillin remained 
a laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate 
the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities. They then went on to win 
the Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several American 
drug companies continued development, and within a few years 
it was commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly 
transformed the treatment of infections. For the time being, they remain some of the most important, 
life-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, 
the more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds 
that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis. As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria 
have evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number 
of bacterial infections. This means it’s essential that doctors 
not overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients 
in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported 
drug allergy. However, the vast majority— over 90%—
of people who think they’re allergic 
to penicillin actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label 
as children, when a rash appears after they’re treated 
for an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit 
is the original infection, or a reaction between the infection 
and the antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems 
mistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely 
and can be very dangerous. So if you think you’re allergic 
but don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They’ll complete an evaluation 
that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug 
may lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people 
who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy 
within ten years. This is great news for people 
who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, 
as it has done for so many others.

that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug 
may lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people 
who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy 
within ten years. This is great news for people 
who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, 
as it has done for so many others.

**Transcript**:
London, 1928: a group of mold spores 
surf a breeze through a lab. They drift onto a petri dish, 
and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, 
a Scottish scientist investigating the properties 
of infectious bacteria. At this time, 
Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds 
a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold 
is a zone completely and unexpectedly 
clear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold 
was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species 
in the Penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed 
the antibacterial compound “penicillin.” What Fleming stumbled upon 
was a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold 
constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies 
that might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys 
many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis 
of their cell walls. These walls get their strength 
from a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids, that are constantly being 
broken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the compounds 
that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being 
reconstructed at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates 
the release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell’s structure 
breaks down completely. This two-pronged attack 
is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in petri-dishes, 
our bodies, or elsewhere. It’s not, however, 
harmful to our own cells, because those don’t have cell walls. For a decade or so 
after Fleming’s discovery, penicillin remained 
a laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate 
the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities. They then went on to win 
the Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several American 
drug companies continued development, and within a few years 
it was commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly 
transformed the treatment of infections. For the time being, they remain some of the most important, 
life-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, 
the more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds 
that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis. As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria 
have evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number 
of bacterial infections. This means it’s essential that doctors 
not overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients 
in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported 
drug allergy. However, the vast majority— over 90%—
of people who think they’re allergic 
to penicillin actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label 
as children, when a rash appears after they’re treated 
for an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit 
is the original infection, or a reaction between the infection 
and the antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems 
mistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely 
and can be very dangerous. So if you think you’re allergic 
but don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They’ll complete an evaluation 
that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug 
may lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people 
who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy 
within ten years. This is great news for people 
who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, 
as it has done for so many others.

**Transcript**:
Someone has tripped the magical alarms 
in the Element Temple. By the time you and the other monks 
arrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster 
on your hands. Overnight, four young apprentices 
broke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals. But when the alarm went off 
they panicked, and each of them swallowed the crystal 
they held right before they were caught. With no idea how to control 
the crystals’ vast powers, they’ll soon transform 
into uncontrollable elemental spirits. Improbably enough, the old monk next to you 
has seen something similar happen before. He explains: 
“You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the proper containment 
field before they transform. The elements compel their masters: those who ate the Earth and Water Crystals
must speak the truth, while those who consumed Fire and Air 
must lie." The youths are too scared to confess 
their own transgressions. Instead, they fall to accusing each other. “Rikku took the Water crystal!” 
Sumi blurts out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, 
she stole the Fire crystal!” So Bella yells: 
“Jonah ate the Air crystal, I saw him!” Jonah looks up timidly 
and shakes his head. “I… I don’t know what happened, 
but Sumi doesn’t have the Earth crystal.” So who ate which crystal? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. There’s no getting around it— 
this will take some trial and error. But that’s not a bad thing. If we make a wrong guess, we’ll eventually reach a point where 
our conclusions contradict each other. That would allow us to confirm 
that our initial guess was wrong and work from there. This is a technique 
known as proof by contradiction. The trick is in being strategic 
about where we begin our guessing. Some assumptions 
might not lead to contradictions without making further assumptions. We want to pick one that creates 
the most constraints on its own, and thus gives us the most information 
when it turns out to be right or wrong. Take, for example, Sumi’s statement. If we assume she’s telling the truth, we’d know the identity 
of both truth tellers. Rikku would have the Water crystal, 
and since she’s not lying about him, Sumi would have Earth. So Bella would have the Fire crystal, 
as Rikku says. But then Bella would have to be lying 
about Jonah having the Air crystal. And yet that’s the only remaining option. This is a contradiction, and it tells us 
our initial assumption was wrong. So now we can go back to the start, but with the added knowledge 
that Sumi is lying. As a liar, Sumi 
must either have the Fire or Air crystal. That means Jonah 
was telling the truth about her, so he can’t have taken either of those. And that means Bella was lying about him, so she must also have either Fire or Air. Since Sumi was lying, 
Rikku can’t have taken the Water crystal— the only one left 
who could have it is Jonah. And because we’ve already identified 
the two liars, Rikku must have the Earth crystal. That means Bella has the Fire crystal 
and Sumi has Air. You manage to get them all 
in the proper containment fields just as the crystals’ magic 
begins to manifest. Compared with the difficult task 
of training these kids to control their new powers, figuring out who had which crystal
was elementary.

Sumi blurts out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, 
she stole the Fire crystal!” So Bella yells: 
“Jonah ate the Air crystal, I saw him!” Jonah looks up timidly 
and shakes his head. “I… I don’t know what happened, 
but Sumi doesn’t have the Earth crystal.” So who ate which crystal? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. There’s no getting around it— 
this will take some trial and error. But that’s not a bad thing. If we make a wrong guess, we’ll eventually reach a point where 
our conclusions contradict each other. That would allow us to confirm 
that our initial guess was wrong and work from there. This is a technique 
known as proof by contradiction. The trick is in being strategic 
about where we begin our guessing. Some assumptions 
might not lead to contradictions without making further assumptions. We want to pick one that creates 
the most constraints on its own, and thus gives us the most information 
when it turns out to be right or wrong. Take, for example, Sumi’s statement. If we assume she’s telling the truth, we’d know the identity 
of both truth tellers. Rikku would have the Water crystal, 
and since she’s not lying about him, Sumi would have Earth. So Bella would have the Fire crystal, 
as Rikku says. But then Bella would have to be lying 
about Jonah having the Air crystal. And yet that’s the only remaining option. This is a contradiction, and it tells us 
our initial assumption was wrong. So now we can go back to the start, but with the added knowledge 
that Sumi is lying. As a liar, Sumi 
must either have the Fire or Air crystal. That means Jonah 
was telling the truth about her, so he can’t have taken either of those. And that means Bella was lying about him, so she must also have either Fire or Air. Since Sumi was lying, 
Rikku can’t have taken the Water crystal— the only one left 
who could have it is Jonah. And because we’ve already identified 
the two liars, Rikku must have the Earth crystal. That means Bella has the Fire crystal 
and Sumi has Air. You manage to get them all 
in the proper containment fields just as the crystals’ magic 
begins to manifest. Compared with the difficult task 
of training these kids to control their new powers, figuring out who had which crystal
was elementary.

**Transcript**:
Someone has tripped the magical alarms 
in the Element Temple. By the time you and the other monks 
arrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster 
on your hands. Overnight, four young apprentices 
broke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals. But when the alarm went off 
they panicked, and each of them swallowed the crystal 
they held right before they were caught. With no idea how to control 
the crystals’ vast powers, they’ll soon transform 
into uncontrollable elemental spirits. Improbably enough, the old monk next to you 
has seen something similar happen before. He explains: 
“You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the proper containment 
field before they transform. The elements compel their masters: those who ate the Earth and Water Crystals
must speak the truth, while those who consumed Fire and Air 
must lie." The youths are too scared to confess 
their own transgressions. Instead, they fall to accusing each other. “Rikku took the Water crystal!” 
Sumi blurts out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, 
she stole the Fire crystal!” So Bella yells:

**Transcript**:
In 1972, Thomas Sankara 
was swept into a revolution for a country not his own. Hailing from the West African nation 
of Burkina Faso— then known as Upper Volta— the 22-year-old soldier 
had travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon arriving, 
he found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries 
sought to wrest control of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors 
inspired Sankara to read works by socialist leaders
like Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy. When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free 
his country from its colonial legacy. Born in 1949, Sankara was raised 
in a relatively privileged household as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, 
but like many of his peers, Sankara saw the military 
as the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma 
and transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular 
with the reigning government. Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power 
in the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies 
were a far cry from the sweeping changes 
Sankara proposed, but, by 1981, 
Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role 
in Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara," 
Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, 
he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, 
he delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, 
women, and young people. He even tried to persuade 
other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors 
felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would 
harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months 
after becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration 
forced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest. Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s 
4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests 
ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate 
a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend 
and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included 
an attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned 
without further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara 
became the new President of Upper Volta. Finally in charge, 
Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, 
he renamed the country from its French colonial title 
"Upper Volta" to "Burkina Faso," which translates 
to “Land of Upright Men." Over the next four years he established 
a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting 
of over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down 
inflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element 
of Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement 
for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, 
polygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint
women to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military. However, Sankara’s socialist policies 
were met with much resistance. Many students and elites 
believed his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso 
from its capitalist peers. His crackdown 
on the misuse of public funds turned government officials 
against him as well. After four years, 
what began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready 
to yield his power. He executed 
increasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions 
and the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned even his closest friends 
against him. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a meeting 
when a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters. Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered 
by his friend Blaise Compaoré. Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have proven 
themselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have celebrated 
Sankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even 
adopted Sankara’s economic models. On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara 
was erected in Burkina Faso’s capital, establishing his place 
as an icon of revolution for his country and throughout the world.

**Transcript**:
In 1972, Thomas Sankara 
was swept into a revolution for a country not his own. Hailing from the West African nation 
of Burkina Faso— then known as Upper Volta— the 22-year-old soldier 
had travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon arriving, 
he found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries 
sought to wrest control of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors 
inspired Sankara to read works by socialist leaders
like Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy. When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free 
his country from its colonial legacy. Born in 1949, Sankara was raised 
in a relatively privileged household as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, 
but like many of his peers, Sankara saw the military 
as the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma 
and transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular 
with the reigning government. Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power 
in the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies 
were a far cry from the sweeping changes 
Sankara proposed, but, by 1981, 
Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role 
in Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara," 
Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, 
he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, 
he delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, 
women, and young people. He even tried to persuade 
other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors 
felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would 
harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months 
after becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration 
forced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest. Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s 
4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests 
ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate 
a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend 
and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included 
an attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned 
without further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara 
became the new President of Upper Volta. Finally in charge, 
Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, 
he renamed the country from its French colonial title 
"Upper Volta" to "Burkina Faso," which translates 
to “Land of Upright Men." Over the next four years he established 
a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting 
of over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down 
inflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element 
of Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement 
for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, 
polygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint
women to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military. However, Sankara’s socialist policies 
were met with much resistance. Many students and elites 
believed his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso 
from its capitalist peers. His crackdown 
on the misuse of public funds turned government officials 
against him as well. After four years, 
what began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready 
to yield his power. He executed 
increasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions

**Transcript**:
As the April sun rises 
on a pile of firewood, something royal stirs inside. This wasp queen is one of thousands 
who mated in late autumn and hibernated through the winter. Now she emerges into the spring air 
to begin her reign. Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky. While hibernating in compost piles 
and underground burrows, many sleeping queens 
were eaten by spiders. Warm winters caused by climate change 
led other queens to emerge early, only to find there was no available food. And some queens that survived the winter 
fell victim to the threats of spring, such as carnivorous plants, birds, 
and manmade pesticides. Our queen is the lone survivor 
of her old hive, and now, she must become 
the foundress of a new one. But first, breakfast. The queen heads for a citrus grove 
full of honeybee hives. The bees can be dangerous if provoked, but right now they’re paralyzed 
by the morning cold. Their hairy bodies are dripping 
with sugar water from an earlier feeding, and the resourceful queen 
licks them for a morning snack. Newly energized, our queen searches 
for a safe nesting area. This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, 
and predators, is ideal. She chews the surrounding wood 
and plant fibers to make a paper-like pulp. Then she builds around 50 brood cells 
that comprise the beginning of her nest. Using sperm stored from last fall, the queen lays a fertilized egg 
into each cell, producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes. Within a week, 
these will hatch into female larva. But until then, the queen must hunt down 
smaller insects to feed her brood, all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,
and defending against intruders. Fortunately, our queen is well prepared. Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times
as they need to. With such a busy schedule, 
the queen barely has time to feed herself. Luckily, she doesn’t have to. When she feeds an insect to her grubs, they digest the bug into a sugary 
substance that sustains their mother. By the end of July, these first larva 
have matured into adult workers, ready to take on foraging, 
building, and defense. The queen can now lay eggs full-time, sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils 
and their unfertilized eggs. Although each worker only lives 
for roughly 3 weeks, the queen’s continuous egg-laying 
swells their ranks. In just one summer, 
the nest reaches the size of a basketball, supporting thousands of workers. Such a large population needs to eat, and the nearby garden 
provides a veritable buffet. As the swarm descends, 
alarmed humans try to swat them. They even fight back with pesticides 
that purposefully poison wasps, and inadvertently impact 
a wide-range of local wildlife. But the wasps are actually vital 
to this ecosystem. Sitting at the top 
of the local invertebrate food chain, these insects keep spiders, mites, 
and centipedes, in check. Wasps consume crop-eating insects, making them particularly helpful 
for farms and gardens. They even pollinate fruits and vegetables, and help winemakers 
by biting into their grapes and jump-starting fermentation. This feast continues until autumn, 
when the foundress changes course. She begins grooming some eggs 
into a new generation of queens, while also laying unfertilized eggs that will mature into reproductive males 
called drones. This new crop of queens and males 
requires more food. But with summer over, 
the usual sources run dry, and the foraging wasps 
start taking more aggressive risks. By September, 
the hive’s organization deteriorates. Hungry workers no longer clean the nest 
and various scavengers move in. Just when it seems 
the hive can no longer sustain itself, the fertile queens and their drones 
depart in a massive swarm. As the days grow colder, 
the workers starve, and our queen 
reaches the end of her lifespan. But above, a swarm of reproductive wasps 
has successfully mated. The males die off shortly after, but the newly fertilized queens are ready 
to find shelter for their long sleep. And this woodpile looks like 
the perfect place to spend the winter.

into a new generation of queens, while also laying unfertilized eggs that will mature into reproductive males 
called drones. This new crop of queens and males 
requires more food. But with summer over, 
the usual sources run dry, and the foraging wasps 
start taking more aggressive risks. By September, 
the hive’s organization deteriorates. Hungry workers no longer clean the nest 
and various scavengers move in. Just when it seems

depart in a massive swarm. As the days grow colder,

**Transcript**:
As the April sun rises 
on a pile of firewood, something royal stirs inside. This wasp queen is one of thousands 
who mated in late autumn and hibernated through the winter. Now she emerges into the spring air 
to begin her reign. Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky. While hibernating in compost piles 
and underground burrows, many sleeping queens 
were eaten by spiders. Warm winters caused by climate change 
led other queens to emerge early, only to find there was no available food. And some queens that survived the winter 
fell victim to the threats of spring, such as carnivorous plants, birds, 
and manmade pesticides. Our queen is the lone survivor 
of her old hive, and now, she must become 
the foundress of a new one. But first, breakfast. The queen heads for a citrus grove 
full of honeybee hives. The bees can be dangerous if provoked, but right now they’re paralyzed 
by the morning cold. Their hairy bodies are dripping 
with sugar water from an earlier feeding, and the resourceful queen 
licks them for a morning snack. Newly energized, our queen searches 
for a safe nesting area. This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, 
and predators, is ideal. She chews the surrounding wood 
and plant fibers to make a paper-like pulp. Then she builds around 50 brood cells 
that comprise the beginning of her nest. Using sperm stored from last fall, the queen lays a fertilized egg 
into each cell, producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes. Within a week, 
these will hatch into female larva. But until then, the queen must hunt down 
smaller insects to feed her brood, all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,
and defending against intruders. Fortunately, our queen is well prepared. Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times
as they need to. With such a busy schedule, 
the queen barely has time to feed herself. Luckily, she doesn’t have to. When she feeds an insect to her grubs, they digest the bug into a sugary 
substance that sustains their mother. By the end of July, these first larva 
have matured into adult workers, ready to take on foraging, 
building, and defense. The queen can now lay eggs full-time, sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils 
and their unfertilized eggs. Although each worker only lives 
for roughly 3 weeks, the queen’s continuous egg-laying 
swells their ranks. In just one summer, 
the nest reaches the size of a basketball, supporting thousands of workers. Such a large population needs to eat, and the nearby garden 
provides a veritable buffet. As the swarm descends, 
alarmed humans try to swat them. They even fight back with pesticides 
that purposefully poison wasps, and inadvertently impact 
a wide-range of local wildlife. But the wasps are actually vital 
to this ecosystem. Sitting at the top 
of the local invertebrate food chain, these insects keep spiders, mites, 
and centipedes, in check. Wasps consume crop-eating insects, making them particularly helpful 
for farms and gardens. They even pollinate fruits and vegetables, and help winemakers 
by biting into their grapes and jump-starting fermentation. This feast continues until autumn, 
when the foundress changes course. She begins grooming some eggs 
into a new generation of queens, while also laying unfertilized eggs that will mature into reproductive males

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
At any given moment, trillions of cells 
are traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body 
in just one minute. Each of these cells 
has its origins deep in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, 
but they’re actually quite porous inside. Large and small blood vessels 
enter through these holes. And inside most of the large bones 
of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat 
and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements 
are blood stem cells. These stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate 
into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions 
of new blood cells into circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes 
in small capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels 
and exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance 
it can be traced back to the bone marrow. Blood cancers often begin 
with genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells themselves 
are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere 
with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced 
blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often 
an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow 
with a donor’s. Here’s how it works. First, blood stem cells 
are extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out 
of the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood 
through a machine that separates it 
into different components. In other cases, 
the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, 
with a needle. Meanwhile, the recipient 
prepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation 
kill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells 
and blood stem cells. This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely 
to attack the transplanted cells. Then the donor cells are infused into 
the patient’s body through a central line. They initially circulate 
in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, 
called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them 
back to the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing
new, healthy blood cells. Just a small population 
of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s 
worth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant 
can also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells 
generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s 
original immune system couldn’t. This phenomenon can help eradicate 
stubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants 
also come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease. It happens when the immune system 
generated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs. This life-threatening condition 
occurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells 
from anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells 
are collected from the blood 
as opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take 
immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed 
from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk 
of graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient 
avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system 
may reject the donor cells. So it’s crucial to find the best match 
possible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic code 
determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are similar 
in the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system 
is more likely to accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, 
the best matches are often siblings. But many patients 
who need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member. Those patients 
turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is 
a cheek swab to test for a genetic match. And in many cases, 
the donation itself isn’t much more complicated 
than giving blood. It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource 
that’s completely renewable.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
At any given moment, trillions of cells 
are traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body 
in just one minute. Each of these cells 
has its origins deep in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, 
but they’re actually quite porous inside. Large and small blood vessels 
enter through these holes. And inside most of the large bones 
of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat 
and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements 
are blood stem cells. These stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate 
into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions 
of new blood cells into circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes 
in small capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels 
and exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance 
it can be traced back to the bone marrow. Blood cancers often begin 
with genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells themselves 
are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere 
with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced 
blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often 
an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow 
with a donor’s. Here’s how it works. First, blood stem cells 
are extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out 
of the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood 
through a machine that separates it 
into different components. In other cases, 
the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, 
with a needle. Meanwhile, the recipient 
prepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation 
kill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells 
and blood stem cells. This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely 
to attack the transplanted cells. Then the donor cells are infused into 
the patient’s body through a central line. They initially circulate 
in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, 
called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them 
back to the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing
new, healthy blood cells. Just a small population 
of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s 
worth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant 
can also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells 
generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s 
original immune system couldn’t. This phenomenon can help eradicate 
stubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants 
also come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease. It happens when the immune system 
generated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs. This life-threatening condition 
occurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells 
from anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells 
are collected from the blood 
as opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take 
immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed 
from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk 
of graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient 
avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system 
may reject the donor cells. So it’s crucial to find the best match 
possible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic code 
determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are similar 
in the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system 
is more likely to accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, 
the best matches are often siblings. But many patients 
who need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member. Those patients 
turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is 
a cheek swab to test for a genetic match. And in many cases, 
the donation itself isn’t much more complicated 
than giving blood. It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource 
that’s completely renewable.

**Transcript**:
The Vikings came from the rugged, 
inhospitable north known today as Scandinavia. As the Roman Empire 
flourished further south, Scandinavians had small settlements, 
no central government, and no coinage. Yet by the 11th century, the Vikings 
had spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes 
throughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and even building outposts 
in North America. The secret to their success 
was their ships. The formidable Viking longship had its origins 
in the humble dugout canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia 
had used these canoes for transportation. Dense forests and tall mountains 
made overland travel difficult, but long coastlines 
and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out 
logs rowed with paddles. Over time, they added planks 
to the log boat base using the clinker, 
or "lapstrake," technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other 
along their edges. As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians 
served in their new neighbors’ armies— and brought home 
Roman maritime technology. The Mediterranean cultures 
at the heart of the Roman Empire had large warships 
that controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods 
along the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and relied on a strong skeleton 
of internal timbers fastened to the outer planks 
with copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians 
incorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles 
with anchored oars. This change 
hugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but also required stronger ships. So boat builders began to use iron nails 
for fasteners rather than sewing. They abandoned 
the log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats became higher 
and more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the concept
of the original log boat: their strength 
depended on the outer shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells— 
thin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships. Competing chieftains quickly refined 
the new ships to be even more efficient. The lighter the boat, 
the more versatile it would be and the less investment of resources 
it would require— an essential advantage 
in a decentralized culture without large supplies of people. These ships still had no sails— 
sails were costly, and for now the rowed ships 
could meet their needs. That changed 
after the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century. Western Europe 
took a heavy economic blow, leveling the playing field a bit 
for the Scandinavians. As the region revived, new and vigorous trade routes 
extended into and through Scandinavia. The wealth that flowed along these routes helped create a new, more prosperous 
and powerful class of Scandinavians, whose members 
competed constantly with each other over trade routes and territory. By the 8th century, 
a sailing ship began to make sense: it could go further, faster, 
in search of newly available plunder. With the addition of sails, the already light and speedy ships 
became nearly unbeatable. The Viking ship was born. Viking longships could soon carry 
as many as 100 Vikings to battle. Fleets of them 
could land on open beaches, penetrate deep into river systems, 
and be moved over land if need be. When not at war, the vessels were used to transport goods 
and make trade journeys. There were smaller versions 
for fishing and local excursions, and larger adaptations 
for open sea voyages capable of carrying 
tens of tons of cargo. Thanks to their inventiveness 
in the face of difficult terrain and weak economies, 
the Vikings sailed west, settled the North Atlantic 
and explored the North American coast centuries before any other Europeans 
would set foot there.

**Transcript**:
The Vikings came from the rugged, 
inhospitable north known today as Scandinavia. As the Roman Empire 
flourished further south, Scandinavians had small settlements, 
no central government, and no coinage. Yet by the 11th century, the Vikings 
had spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes 
throughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and even building outposts 
in North America. The secret to their success 
was their ships. The formidable Viking longship had its origins 
in the humble dugout canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia 
had used these canoes for transportation. Dense forests and tall mountains 
made overland travel difficult, but long coastlines 
and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out 
logs rowed with paddles. Over time, they added planks 
to the log boat base using the clinker, 
or "lapstrake," technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other 
along their edges. As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians 
served in their new neighbors’ armies— and brought home 
Roman maritime technology. The Mediterranean cultures 
at the heart of the Roman Empire had large warships 
that controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods 
along the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and relied on a strong skeleton 
of internal timbers fastened to the outer planks 
with copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians 
incorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles 
with anchored oars. This change 
hugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but also required stronger ships. So boat builders began to use iron nails 
for fasteners rather than sewing. They abandoned 
the log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats became higher 
and more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the concept
of the original log boat: their strength 
depended on the outer shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells— 
thin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships. Competing chieftains quickly refined 
the new ships to be even more efficient. The lighter the boat, 
the more versatile it would be and the less investment of resources 
it would require— an essential advantage 
in a decentralized culture without large supplies of people. These ships still had no sails— 
sails were costly, and for now the rowed ships 
could meet their needs. That changed 
after the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century. Western Europe 
took a heavy economic blow, leveling the playing field a bit 
for the Scandinavians. As the region revived, new and vigorous trade routes 
extended into and through Scandinavia. The wealth that flowed along these routes helped create a new, more prosperous 
and powerful class of Scandinavians, whose members 
competed constantly with each other over trade routes and territory. By the 8th century, 
a sailing ship began to make sense: it could go further, faster, 
in search of newly available plunder. With the addition of sails, the already light and speedy ships 
became nearly unbeatable. The Viking ship was born. Viking longships could soon carry 
as many as 100 Vikings to battle. Fleets of them 
could land on open beaches, penetrate deep into river systems, 
and be moved over land if need be. When not at war, the vessels were used to transport goods 
and make trade journeys. There were smaller versions 
for fishing and local excursions, and larger adaptations 
for open sea voyages capable of carrying 
tens of tons of cargo. Thanks to their inventiveness 
in the face of difficult terrain and weak economies, 
the Vikings sailed west, settled the North Atlantic 
and explored the North American coast centuries before any other Europeans 
would set foot there.

**Transcript**:
It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall, and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there. At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight. But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants, called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings— creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight 
in the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though— returning their mother 
to good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies. These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins. Workers from nests 
up to several meters away begin to steal offspring 
from our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders 
from even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile. Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer, and returns to worker production 
in the fall. After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood, while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home, the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually, they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.

**Transcript**:
It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall, and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there. At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight. But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants, called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings— creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight 
in the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though— returning their mother 
to good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies. These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins. Workers from nests 
up to several meters away begin to steal offspring 
from our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders 
from even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile. Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer, and returns to worker production 
in the fall. After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood, while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home, the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually, they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

to this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood, while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home, the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers. The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually, they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony. Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Brood raiding ___________:
Options: A. is carried out by female alates against other female alates., B. results in the brood, workers, and many females from multiple founding nests residing in a single nest., C. is when males steal brood from females., D. is carried out by mature colonies against newly founded colonies.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is brood-raiding, and how does it affect the queen's colony?

**Transcript**:
We typically think of ballet 
as harmonious, graceful and polished– hardly features that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance 
of Igor Stravinsky’s "The Rite of Spring," audience members were so outraged 
that they drowned out the orchestra. Accounts of the event include 
people hurling objects at the stage, challenging each other to fights, 
and getting arrested– all on what started 
as a sophisticated night at the ballet. First performed in May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées 
in Paris, "The Rite of Spring" 
is set in prehistoric times. The narrative follows 
an ancient Pagan community worshipping the Earth 
and preparing for the sacrifice of a woman intended to bring about 
the change of seasons. But the ballet is much more 
concerned with the violent relationship between humans, nature, and culture than with character or plot. These themes manifest 
in a truly upsetting production which combines harsh music, 
jerky dancing, and uncanny staging. It opens with dancers 
awakening to a solo bassoon, playing in an eerily high register. This gives way to discordant strings, 
punctured by unexpected pauses while the dancers twitch to the music. These frightening figures 
enact the ballet’s brutal premise, which set audiences on edge and shattered the conventions 
of classical music. In these ways and many more, "The Rite of Spring" 
challenged the orchestral traditions of the 19th century. Composed on the cusp 
of both the first World War and the Russian revolution, "The Rite of Spring" seethes with urgency. This tension is reflected 
in various formal experiments, including innovative uses of syncopation, 
or irregular rhythm; atonality or the lack of a single key, and the presence 
of multiple time signatures. Alongside these 
strikingly modern features, Stravinsky spliced in aspects 
of Russian folk music– a combination that deliberately disrupted the expectations of his sophisticated, 
urban audience. This wasn’t Stravinsky’s 
first use of folk music. Born in a small town 
outside of St. Petersburg in 1882, Stravinsky’s reputation was cemented 
with the lush ballet "The Firebird." Based on a Russian fairytale, this production 
was steeped in Stravinsky’s fascination with folk culture. But he plotted a wilder project 
in "The Rite of Spring," pushing folk and musical boundaries 
to draw out the rawness of pagan ritual. Stravinsky brought this reverie to life in collaboration 
with artist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was obsessed 
with prehistoric times. He had published essays 
about human sacrifice and worked on excavations 
of Slavic tombs in addition to set and costume design. For "The Rite of Spring," 
he drew from Russian medieval art and peasant garments to create costumes 
that hung awkwardly on the dancers’ bodies. Roerich set them against vivid backdrops 
of primeval nature; full of jagged rocks, looming trees 
and nightmarish colors. Along with its dazzling sets 
and searing score, the original choreography 
for "The Rite of Spring" was highly provocative. This was the doing 
of legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who developed dances 
to rethink “the roots of movement itself.” Although Stravinsky 
later expressed frustration with Nijinsky’s demanding rehearsals and single-minded interpretations 
of the music, his choreography proved 
as pioneering as Stravinsky’s composition. He contorted traditional ballet– to both the awe and horror 
of his audience, many of whom expected 
the refinement and romance of the genre. The dancing in "The Rite of Spring" 
is agitated and uneven, with performers cowering, writhing 
and leaping about as if possessed. Often, the dancers are not one 
with the music but rather seem to struggle against it. Nijinsky instructed them 
to turn their toes inwards and land heavily after jumps,
often off the beat. For the final, frenzied scene, a woman dances herself to death 
to loud bangs and jarring strings. The ballet ends abruptly on a harsh, 
haunting chord. Today, "The Rite of Spring" remains as chilling 
as its controversial debut, but the shockwaves of the original work
continue to resound and inspire. You can hear Stravinsky’s influence 
in modern jazz’s dueling rhythms, folky classical music, 
and even film scores for horror movies, which still illicit 
a riotous audience response.

**Transcript**:
We typically think of ballet 
as harmonious, graceful and polished– hardly features that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance 
of Igor Stravinsky’s "The Rite of Spring," audience members were so outraged 
that they drowned out the orchestra. Accounts of the event include 
people hurling objects at the stage, challenging each other to fights, 
and getting arrested– all on what started 
as a sophisticated night at the ballet. First performed in May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées 
in Paris, "The Rite of Spring" 
is set in prehistoric times. The narrative follows 
an ancient Pagan community worshipping the Earth 
and preparing for the sacrifice of a woman intended to bring about 
the change of seasons. But the ballet is much more 
concerned with the violent relationship between humans, nature, and culture than with character or plot. These themes manifest 
in a truly upsetting production which combines harsh music, 
jerky dancing, and uncanny staging. It opens with dancers 
awakening to a solo bassoon, playing in an eerily high register. This gives way to discordant strings, 
punctured by unexpected pauses while the dancers twitch to the music. These frightening figures 
enact the ballet’s brutal premise, which set audiences on edge and shattered the conventions 
of classical music. In these ways and many more, "The Rite of Spring" 
challenged the orchestral traditions of the 19th century. Composed on the cusp 
of both the first World War and the Russian revolution, "The Rite of Spring" seethes with urgency. This tension is reflected 
in various formal experiments, including innovative uses of syncopation, 
or irregular rhythm; atonality or the lack of a single key, and the presence 
of multiple time signatures. Alongside these 
strikingly modern features, Stravinsky spliced in aspects 
of Russian folk music– a combination that deliberately disrupted the expectations of his sophisticated, 
urban audience. This wasn’t Stravinsky’s 
first use of folk music. Born in a small town 
outside of St. Petersburg in 1882, Stravinsky’s reputation was cemented 
with the lush ballet "The Firebird." Based on a Russian fairytale, this production 
was steeped in Stravinsky’s fascination with folk culture. But he plotted a wilder project 
in "The Rite of Spring," pushing folk and musical boundaries 
to draw out the rawness of pagan ritual. Stravinsky brought this reverie to life in collaboration 
with artist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was obsessed 
with prehistoric times. He had published essays 
about human sacrifice and worked on excavations 
of Slavic tombs in addition to set and costume design. For "The Rite of Spring," 
he drew from Russian medieval art and peasant garments to create costumes 
that hung awkwardly on the dancers’ bodies. Roerich set them against vivid backdrops 
of primeval nature; full of jagged rocks, looming trees 
and nightmarish colors. Along with its dazzling sets 
and searing score, the original choreography 
for "The Rite of Spring" was highly provocative. This was the doing 
of legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who developed dances 
to rethink “the roots of movement itself.” Although Stravinsky 
later expressed frustration with Nijinsky’s demanding rehearsals and single-minded interpretations 
of the music, his choreography proved 
as pioneering as Stravinsky’s composition. He contorted traditional ballet– to both the awe and horror 
of his audience, many of whom expected

**Transcript**:
After centuries of war, the world’s kingdoms 
have come to an agreement. Every five years, teams representing 
the elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament 
of dragon jousting. Every team will face 
each of the others once. The kingdom whose team wins the most 
matches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament. To prevent any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted 
in absolute secret except for a group of wizards 
who will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, 
or spells to cheat. You’ve been given the extremely 
important job of recording the scores for the first inaugural tournament. But the opening celebrations 
get a bit out of control, and when you wake up, you realize the games 
are already underway. Fortunately, no one has noticed 
your absence so far. However, you need to get up to speed 
quickly; if your boss, 
the head tournament official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job,
you’ll lose your head. After weighing your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings 
to one of the regulation wizards in return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard 
to fill out. But before he can finish, 
your boss walks into the tent. You barely manage to hide the scorecard 
in time, and the wizard excuses himself. Your boss chuckles. “Hope you didn’t believe anything 
Gorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, 
even in writing. Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring 
the tournament’s been? Every team has played at least once, yet not a single match with 
a combined score of more than five hits! Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute 
to review your scorecard.” You laugh along, and when he leaves you look 
at the partially completed card, now knowing every single number 
on it is wrong. You’ve only got one chance 
to save yourself, so what’s the real score of each match? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The incredible thing about this riddle 
is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack 
of correct information. And that’s possible because 
knowing that something is false is meaningful information 
in its own right. The first key is to realize that no team 
will play more than two matches, since there are only two other teams. So if the elves didn’t actually play 
one match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two, the truth must be that elves played two 
and goblins played one. For the elves to have played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams
once. And since goblins have only played 
one match so far— against the elves— that means the match between goblins 
and treefolk has not occurred yet. We know it’s false that the treefolk tied 
zero matches, which means their bout 
against the elves must’ve tied. We also know that the elves won 
at least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, 
they must have beaten the goblins. But can we figure out the actual scores? Let’s start with the elf-treefolk tie. Because no more than five total hits 
were scored, the final tally must’ve been 
0-0, 1-1, or 2-2. But the treefolk must’ve scored 
some hits, and it’s false that they only had one hit 
scored against them. The only option that leaves is 2-2. In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins must’ve scored 
at least one hit. And the elf score must be 2 or more 
for them to have won the match. This leaves only a few possibilities 
that add up to 5 or less. The elves couldn’t have scored three, 
so that eliminates these two. And their total hits scored 
across both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too. So the score must’ve been 2-1. With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— 
and your neck. Gorbak the wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills 
quickly evened the score.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
After centuries of war, the world’s kingdoms 
have come to an agreement. Every five years, teams representing 
the elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament 
of dragon jousting. Every team will face 
each of the others once. The kingdom whose team wins the most 
matches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament. To prevent any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted 
in absolute secret except for a group of wizards 
who will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, 
or spells to cheat. You’ve been given the extremely 
important job of recording the scores for the first inaugural tournament. But the opening celebrations 
get a bit out of control, and when you wake up, you realize the games 
are already underway. Fortunately, no one has noticed 
your absence so far. However, you need to get up to speed 
quickly; if your boss, 
the head tournament official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job,
you’ll lose your head. After weighing your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings 
to one of the regulation wizards in return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard 
to fill out. But before he can finish, 
your boss walks into the tent. You barely manage to hide the scorecard 
in time, and the wizard excuses himself. Your boss chuckles. “Hope you didn’t believe anything 
Gorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, 
even in writing. Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring 
the tournament’s been? Every team has played at least once, yet not a single match with 
a combined score of more than five hits! Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute 
to review your scorecard.” You laugh along, and when he leaves you look 
at the partially completed card, now knowing every single number 
on it is wrong. You’ve only got one chance 
to save yourself, so what’s the real score of each match? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The incredible thing about this riddle 
is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack 
of correct information. And that’s possible because 
knowing that something is false is meaningful information 
in its own right. The first key is to realize that no team 
will play more than two matches, since there are only two other teams. So if the elves didn’t actually play 
one match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two, the truth must be that elves played two 
and goblins played one. For the elves to have played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams
once. And since goblins have only played 
one match so far— against the elves— that means the match between goblins 
and treefolk has not occurred yet. We know it’s false that the treefolk tied 
zero matches, which means their bout 
against the elves must’ve tied. We also know that the elves won 
at least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, 
they must have beaten the goblins. But can we figure out the actual scores? Let’s start with the elf-treefolk tie. Because no more than five total hits 
were scored, the final tally must’ve been 
0-0, 1-1, or 2-2. But the treefolk must’ve scored 
some hits, and it’s false that they only had one hit 
scored against them. The only option that leaves is 2-2. In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins must’ve scored 
at least one hit. And the elf score must be 2 or more 
for them to have won the match. This leaves only a few possibilities 
that add up to 5 or less. The elves couldn’t have scored three, 
so that eliminates these two. And their total hits scored 
across both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too. So the score must’ve been 2-1. With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— 
and your neck. Gorbak the wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills 
quickly evened the score.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why are Gorbak’s numbers wrong?
Options: A. He is trying to sabotage you, B. He doesn’t actually know the score, C. He’s under a curse where he consistently must lie
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What unique condition affects Gorbak, the wizard, in the story?
Options: A. He can only tell the truth, B. He is mute and cannot speak, C. He is deaf and cannot hear, D. He can only tell lies
Correct Option: D
