**Transcript**:
Today, plastics are everywhere. All of this plastic originated 
from one small object— that isn’t even made of plastic. For centuries, billiard balls were 
made of ivory from elephant tusks. But when excessive hunting caused
elephant populations to decline in the 19th century, billiard balls makers began to look 
for alternatives, offering huge rewards. So in 1863 an American named 
John Wesley Hyatt took up the challenge. Over the next five years, he invented 
a new material called celluloid, made from cellulose, a compound found
in wood and straw. Hyatt soon discovered celluloid couldn’t
solve the billiard ball problem–– the material wasn’t heavy enough 
and didn’t bounce quite right. But it could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive
materials like coral, tortoiseshell, amber, and mother-of-pearl. He had created what became
known as the first plastic. The word ‘plastic’ can describe 
any material made of polymers, which are just the large molecules
consisting of the same repeating subunit. This includes all human-made plastics, as well as many of the materials
found in living things. But in general, when people refer 
to plastics, they’re referring to synthetic materials. The unifying feature of these 
is that they start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape. Despite taking the prize 
as the first official plastic, celluloid was highly flammable,
which made production risky. So inventors began to hunt
for alternatives. In 1907 a chemist combined phenol— a waste product of coal tar— and formaldehyde, creating 
a hardy new polymer called bakelite. Bakelite was much less flammable 
than celluloid and the raw materials used to make it were
more readily available. Bakelite was only the beginning. In the 1920s, researchers first
commercially developed polystyrene, a spongy plastic used in insulation. Soon after came polyvinyl chloride,
or vinyl, which was flexible yet hardy. Acrylics created transparent, shatter-proof panels 
that mimicked glass. And in the 1930s nylon took centre stage— a polymer designed to mimic silk, 
but with many times its strength. Starting in 1933, polyethylene became
one of the most versatile plastics, still used today to make everything 
from grocery bags, to shampoo bottles, to bulletproof vests. New manufacturing technologies 
accompanied this explosion of materials. The invention of a technique 
called injection-moulding made it possible to insert melted plastics
into molds of any shape, where they would rapidly harden. This created possibilities for products
in new varieties and shapes— and a way to inexpensively and rapidly 
produce plastics at scale. Scientists hoped this economical 
new material would make items that once had been
unaffordable accessible to more people. Instead, plastics were pushed into service
in World War Two. During the war, plastic production 
in the United States quadrupled. Soldiers wore new plastic helmet liners 
and water-resistant vinyl raincoats. Pilots sat in cockpits made of plexiglass,
a shatterproof plastic, and relied on parachutes 
made of resilient nylon. Afterwards, plastic manufacturing 
companies that had sprung up during wartime turned
their attention to consumer products. Plastics began to replace other materials
like wood, glass, and fabric in furniture, clothing, shoes,
televisions, and radios. Versatile plastics opened up possibilities
for packaging— mainly designed to keep food 
and other products fresh for longer. Suddenly, there were plastic garbage bags,
stretchy plastic wrap, squeezable plastic bottles, 
takeaway cartons, and plastic containers for fruit,
vegetables, and meat. Within just a few decades, 
this multifaceted material ushered in what became known as
the “plastics century.” While the plastics century brought 
convenience and cost-effectiveness, it also created staggering 
environmental problems. Many plastics are made of nonrenewable
resources. And plastic packaging was designed
to be single-use, but some plastics take centuries 
to decompose, creating a huge build up of waste. This century we’ll have to concentrate our
innovations on addressing those problems— by reducing plastic use,
developing biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways 
to recycle existing plastic.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: What is the unifying feature of synthetic plastics?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the use of plastics for consumer products, it does relate to the characteristics of plastics that make them suitable for various applications, including consumer products. However, a closer match is found in the context of the transcript.

A more relevant match is found in the context of the transcript, where it is mentioned that "Scientists hoped this economical new material would make items that once had been unaffordable accessible to more people." This is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks why plastic is used for consumer products.

However, an even closer match is not found among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 8: What are some potential solutions to address the environmental problems associated with plastics?** is not the closest match, but **Question 5** is not the best match either.

The best match is actually **not explicitly present** among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one based on the available options, I would say that **Question 5** is a very distant match.

But since I have to provide an answer, I will choose **Question 5** as the closest match, but please note that this is a very distant match.

in wood and straw. Hyatt soon discovered celluloid couldn’t
solve the billiard ball problem–– the material wasn’t heavy enough 
and didn’t bounce quite right. But it could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive
materials like coral, tortoiseshell, amber, and mother-of-pearl. He had created what became
known as the first plastic. The word ‘plastic’ can describe 
any material made of polymers, which are just the large molecules
consisting of the same repeating subunit. This includes all human-made plastics, as well as many of the materials
found in living things. But in general, when people refer 
to plastics, they’re referring to synthetic materials. The unifying feature of these 
is that they start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape. Despite taking the prize 
as the first official plastic, celluloid was highly flammable,
which made production risky. So inventors began to hunt
for alternatives. In 1907 a chemist combined phenol— a waste product of coal tar— and formaldehyde, creating 
a hardy new polymer called bakelite. Bakelite was much less flammable 
than celluloid and the raw materials used to make it were
more readily available. Bakelite was only the beginning. In the 1920s, researchers first
commercially developed polystyrene, a spongy plastic used in insulation. Soon after came polyvinyl chloride,
or vinyl, which was flexible yet hardy. Acrylics created transparent, shatter-proof panels 
that mimicked glass. And in the 1930s nylon took centre stage— a polymer designed to mimic silk, 
but with many times its strength. Starting in 1933, polyethylene became
one of the most versatile plastics, still used today to make everything 
from grocery bags, to shampoo bottles, to bulletproof vests. New manufacturing technologies 
accompanied this explosion of materials. The invention of a technique 
called injection-moulding made it possible to insert melted plastics
into molds of any shape, where they would rapidly harden. This created possibilities for products
in new varieties and shapes— and a way to inexpensively and rapidly 
produce plastics at scale. Scientists hoped this economical 
new material would make items that once had been
unaffordable accessible to more people. Instead, plastics were pushed into service
in World War Two. During the war, plastic production 
in the United States quadrupled. Soldiers wore new plastic helmet liners 
and water-resistant vinyl raincoats. Pilots sat in cockpits made of plexiglass,
a shatterproof plastic, and relied on parachutes 
made of resilient nylon. Afterwards, plastic manufacturing 
companies that had sprung up during wartime turned
their attention to consumer products. Plastics began to replace other materials
like wood, glass, and fabric in furniture, clothing, shoes,
televisions, and radios. Versatile plastics opened up possibilities
for packaging— mainly designed to keep food 
and other products fresh for longer. Suddenly, there were plastic garbage bags,
stretchy plastic wrap, squeezable plastic bottles, 
takeaway cartons, and plastic containers for fruit,
vegetables, and meat. Within just a few decades, 
this multifaceted material ushered in what became known as
the “plastics century.” While the plastics century brought 
convenience and cost-effectiveness, it also created staggering 
environmental problems. Many plastics are made of nonrenewable
resources. And plastic packaging was designed
to be single-use, but some plastics take centuries 
to decompose, creating a huge build up of waste. This century we’ll have to concentrate our
innovations on addressing those problems— by reducing plastic use,
developing biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways 
to recycle existing plastic.

**Transcript**:
An albatross delivered your invitation,
you’ve acquired your wand, ridden the enchanted zeppelin, 
made some fast friends, and are finally ready for the adventure
you’ve dreamed of your entire life: your first day at Magnificent Marigold’s
Magical Macademy. But before you can learn your first spell you must get through the most
nerve-wracking moment of the year: the sorting ceremony. When you put on the sorting hat, 
you hear a voice. “Ah, you’re an interesting one. Every year I choose one student 
for a special challenge, and I choose you. The Magical Macademy had 8 founders, and they established our four houses 
two by two by two by two. I alone know which witches founded which. But there was once 
a mysterious fifth house, lost to time but full of secrets
and powerful artifacts. MMMMMM? If you can tell me who founded each house,
I’ll sort you into whichever you want. However, if you can also tell me 
the name of the secret 5th house, I’ll let you sort into it, and you’ll inherit 
everything you discover. “The two founders of each house 
wore different colored hats with non-matching symbols. No founder started more than one house. Of Funflame and Imaginez, 
one was a founder of Gianteye and the other of Longmous. And of Miraculo and Rimbleby, one established Longmous
and the other Meramaid. Finally, Septimus didn’t found Vidopnir.” So… who founded what,
and what’s the name of the secret house? Pause the video now to
figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The hardest part of solving this logic
puzzle is knowing where to start. No rule by itself is enough to assign 
a founder to his or her house, so the next best thing would be to combine a pair of rules
to learn something. 4 and 5 are good candidates 
to try that with, because they contain a lot of constraints
and both mention Longmous. Miraculo and Rimbleby’s hats 
both have moons, which means that no matter 
who ends up in Longmous, moons will be accounted for. That means Imaginez, who also has moons,
can’t have founded Longmous, so she’s in Gianteye and Funflame
founded Longmous. Miraculo’s hat is red, 
so he can’t be there, so he must be in Meramaid 
and Rimbleby in Longmous. Halfway there! Now we can place Septimus–– rule 6 keeps him out of Vidopnir, 
and his yellow hat out of Gianteye, so he must be in Meramaid. Of the founders left, 
Deepmire and Hypnotum both have stars. So each must go into a different house, taking up the remaining space in Gianteye
and leaving one spot open in Vidopnir, which Tremenda must fill. Tremenda’s blue hat keeps 
Deepmire out of Vidopnir, so we can easily place 
her and, finally, Hypnotum. Now that those founders are sorted, we can start to search 
for the secret house. If you don’t have it yet, 
here are a few hints: Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out yourself! One good strategy for a puzzle like this is to look for patterns 
or unusual pieces of information. First of all, there’s the school’s
obsession with the letter M, right down to its motto, which translates
from Latin to “M is a magic letter.” Curiously, every founder 
has exactly one M in their name, and each M is in a different position. That means that the M’s can
put them in order, 1 through 8. We know we needed to solve the logic 
puzzle before finding the secret house, so there must be something critical about the connection between the founders
and their houses. Here’s where a pattern emerges: 
every founder and house have exactly the same number of letters. This allows the founders to line up 
with their houses quite nicely. The first letters don’t spell anything, but let’s look at the M’s in the names
again and the letters they line up with: M, I, N, O, T, A, U, R. You shout out “MINOTAUR” to a stunned
dining hall, and a secret passage grinds open. The wonders of house Minotaur 
are yours if you want them. But being the first and only resident 
of the secret house would come at a high price: loneliness. So which will it be: riches or friendship?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What constraint is given by the rule that mentions Funflame and Imaginez?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the hats, it does relate to the founders and their houses. However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none directly address the issue of the founders' hats.

A more relevant question that indirectly addresses the issue of hats is:

**Question 9: What constraint allows us to place Septimus in a specific house?**

This question mentions the constraint from Rule 6 and the fact that Septimus's hat is yellow, which is related to the idea of the founders' hats. However, it still does not directly address the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most relevant to the topic of the founders and their houses:

**Question 3**

However, please note that this is not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly ask about the two witches that provide the best clues to solving the problem. But, we can see that Question 3 mentions two witches (Funflame and Imaginez) and their relationship to the houses, and Question 4 discusses the approach to solving the logic puzzle, which involves combining rules that mention specific witches (Miraculo and Rimbleby are mentioned in the explanation).

Considering the options and the overall intent, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it mentions two witches and their relationship to the houses, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
An albatross delivered your invitation,
you’ve acquired your wand, ridden the enchanted zeppelin, 
made some fast friends, and are finally ready for the adventure
you’ve dreamed of your entire life: your first day at Magnificent Marigold’s
Magical Macademy. But before you can learn your first spell you must get through the most
nerve-wracking moment of the year: the sorting ceremony. When you put on the sorting hat, 
you hear a voice. “Ah, you’re an interesting one. Every year I choose one student 
for a special challenge, and I choose you. The Magical Macademy had 8 founders, and they established our four houses 
two by two by two by two. I alone know which witches founded which. But there was once 
a mysterious fifth house, lost to time but full of secrets
and powerful artifacts. MMMMMM? If you can tell me who founded each house,
I’ll sort you into whichever you want. However, if you can also tell me 
the name of the secret 5th house, I’ll let you sort into it, and you’ll inherit 
everything you discover. “The two founders of each house 
wore different colored hats with non-matching symbols. No founder started more than one house. Of Funflame and Imaginez, 
one was a founder of Gianteye and the other of Longmous. And of Miraculo and Rimbleby, one established Longmous
and the other Meramaid. Finally, Septimus didn’t found Vidopnir.” So… who founded what,
and what’s the name of the secret house? Pause the video now to
figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The hardest part of solving this logic
puzzle is knowing where to start. No rule by itself is enough to assign 
a founder to his or her house, so the next best thing would be to combine a pair of rules
to learn something. 4 and 5 are good candidates 
to try that with, because they contain a lot of constraints
and both mention Longmous. Miraculo and Rimbleby’s hats 
both have moons, which means that no matter 
who ends up in Longmous, moons will be accounted for. That means Imaginez, who also has moons,
can’t have founded Longmous, so she’s in Gianteye and Funflame
founded Longmous. Miraculo’s hat is red, 
so he can’t be there, so he must be in Meramaid 
and Rimbleby in Longmous. Halfway there! Now we can place Septimus–– rule 6 keeps him out of Vidopnir, 
and his yellow hat out of Gianteye, so he must be in Meramaid. Of the founders left, 
Deepmire and Hypnotum both have stars. So each must go into a different house, taking up the remaining space in Gianteye
and leaving one spot open in Vidopnir, which Tremenda must fill. Tremenda’s blue hat keeps 
Deepmire out of Vidopnir, so we can easily place 
her and, finally, Hypnotum. Now that those founders are sorted, we can start to search 
for the secret house. If you don’t have it yet, 
here are a few hints: Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out yourself! One good strategy for a puzzle like this is to look for patterns 
or unusual pieces of information. First of all, there’s the school’s
obsession with the letter M, right down to its motto, which translates
from Latin to “M is a magic letter.” Curiously, every founder 
has exactly one M in their name, and each M is in a different position. That means that the M’s can
put them in order, 1 through 8. We know we needed to solve the logic 
puzzle before finding the secret house, so there must be something critical about the connection between the founders
and their houses. Here’s where a pattern emerges: 
every founder and house have exactly the same number of letters. This allows the founders to line up 
with their houses quite nicely. The first letters don’t spell anything, but let’s look at the M’s in the names
again and the letters they line up with: M, I, N, O, T, A, U, R. You shout out “MINOTAUR” to a stunned
dining hall, and a secret passage grinds open. The wonders of house Minotaur 
are yours if you want them. But being the first and only resident 
of the secret house would come at a high price: loneliness. So which will it be: riches or friendship?

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match. Although the question content is not directly related to the definition of an artifact, the intent of the question is to assess the student's problem-solving skills and ability to analyze patterns and connections between clues.

That being said, I must emphasize that the similarity between Question 8 and the ground truth MCQ is still quite low, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the definition of an artifact.

**Transcript**:
This pond is the only home 
this fish has ever known. But lately, it’s gotten crowded 
and food is scarce. Luckily, it has an option many don’t: as a walking catfish, it can dance 
its way out of the water and onto bigger and better things. However, it faces many challenges 
on its terrestrial journey: it’s now in danger of suffocating, 
drying up, suffering physical damage 
from rough terrain, and being hunted by land predators. We think of fish 
as completely aquatic animals. But the walking catfish is just one 
of hundreds of fish species that are actually amphibious, meaning that they possess adaptations 
that enable them to survive on land. Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum. At one end are species 
like the mosquitofish that’ll only move on land when forced. And at the other end 
are species like mudskippers that nonchalantly hop around mudflats 
for days at a time. But why do fish make the exodus 
from water to land? And how do they cope 
with this drastic transition? If temperatures get too high 
for the mangrove rivulus in the shallow tropical pools 
it inhabits, it’ll flip itself onto a bank 
and cool off in the shade. During the dry period, it can survive for two months 
out of the water by staying in moist environments. Meanwhile, the eel catfish 
makes its onshore voyage to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles. And for others, the terrestrial draw 
is more ritualistic. Every year under the cover of night, masses of California grunion flop 
their way onto sandy beaches, where females deposit thousands of eggs 
into the sand before re-entering the ocean. Underwater, fish breathe with gills, which are feathery organs 
packed with blood vessels that absorb dissolved oxygen 
from the water. But in the open air, their gills collapse 
and are rendered useless, so amphibious fishes need 
other ways to breathe. The armored catfish’s stomach 
is packed with blood vessels, so it can gulp down air 
and breathe through its stomach lining. And lungfish, being related 
to the ancestors of all tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates, 
are equipped with true lungs. They’ll actually drown 
if they’re kept underwater too long. Fish have thin, permeable skin 
that allows for essential compounds to diffuse into and out of their bodies 
while they’re underwater. But this works against them on land 
as their bodily moisture diffuses into the air. To dodge dehydration, mudskippers 
roll in the mud like puppies. But the lungfish takes the cake: the rivers it inhabits disappear 
during dry seasons, so it buries itself in the earth
and coats its body in a mucus cocoon. It can survive like this for years 
until being resuscitated by the next big rainstorm. Amphibious fishes use powerful fins 
to move on land and clever tools to navigate as they go. The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, 
no bigger than a few centimeters, scales hundred-meter-tall 
Hawaiian waterfalls, inching its way up by alternately 
attaching the suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins. To find water while on land, 
the mummichog, like most amphibious fishes, 
is on the lookout for reflective surfaces. Other species, like mosquitofish, exercise their inner ear to determine 
where they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll 
find water by moving downhill. Our walking catfish, meanwhile, uses the taste buds that coat 
its body for navigation. These taste buds are concentrated 
in its whiskers, which whip through the air, sensing compounds that signal 
the proximity and quality of nearby water— and prey. The walking catfish will shimmy towards 
attractive volatile amino acids while steering clear of foul waters 
emanating hydrogen sulfide. While amphibious fishes face a multitude 
of new challenges upon leaving the water, they’ve evolved ingenious ways 
to overcome them. They’re resilient in the face 
of droughts and floods and have access to new prey 
as well as a plan B if they need to escape competitive, 
polluted, or unhealthy environments. While being a “fish out of water” 
is generally regarded as a bad thing, for these species, 
it offers an undisputed edge.

where they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll 
find water by moving downhill. Our walking catfish, meanwhile, uses the taste buds that coat 
its body for navigation. These taste buds are concentrated 
in its whiskers, which whip through the air, sensing compounds that signal 
the proximity and quality of nearby water— and prey. The walking catfish will shimmy towards 
attractive volatile amino acids while steering clear of foul waters 
emanating hydrogen sulfide. While amphibious fishes face a multitude 
of new challenges upon leaving the water, they’ve evolved ingenious ways 
to overcome them. They’re resilient in the face 
of droughts and floods and have access to new prey 
as well as a plan B if they need to escape competitive, 
polluted, or unhealthy environments. While being a “fish out of water” 
is generally regarded as a bad thing, for these species, 
it offers an undisputed edge.

**Transcript**:
This pond is the only home 
this fish has ever known. But lately, it’s gotten crowded 
and food is scarce. Luckily, it has an option many don’t: as a walking catfish, it can dance 
its way out of the water and onto bigger and better things. However, it faces many challenges 
on its terrestrial journey: it’s now in danger of suffocating, 
drying up, suffering physical damage 
from rough terrain, and being hunted by land predators. We think of fish 
as completely aquatic animals. But the walking catfish is just one 
of hundreds of fish species that are actually amphibious, meaning that they possess adaptations 
that enable them to survive on land. Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum. At one end are species 
like the mosquitofish that’ll only move on land when forced. And at the other end 
are species like mudskippers that nonchalantly hop around mudflats 
for days at a time. But why do fish make the exodus 
from water to land? And how do they cope 
with this drastic transition? If temperatures get too high 
for the mangrove rivulus in the shallow tropical pools 
it inhabits, it’ll flip itself onto a bank 
and cool off in the shade. During the dry period, it can survive for two months 
out of the water by staying in moist environments. Meanwhile, the eel catfish 
makes its onshore voyage to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles. And for others, the terrestrial draw 
is more ritualistic. Every year under the cover of night, masses of California grunion flop 
their way onto sandy beaches, where females deposit thousands of eggs 
into the sand before re-entering the ocean. Underwater, fish breathe with gills, which are feathery organs 
packed with blood vessels that absorb dissolved oxygen 
from the water. But in the open air, their gills collapse 
and are rendered useless, so amphibious fishes need 
other ways to breathe. The armored catfish’s stomach 
is packed with blood vessels, so it can gulp down air 
and breathe through its stomach lining. And lungfish, being related 
to the ancestors of all tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates, 
are equipped with true lungs. They’ll actually drown 
if they’re kept underwater too long. Fish have thin, permeable skin 
that allows for essential compounds to diffuse into and out of their bodies 
while they’re underwater. But this works against them on land 
as their bodily moisture diffuses into the air. To dodge dehydration, mudskippers 
roll in the mud like puppies. But the lungfish takes the cake: the rivers it inhabits disappear 
during dry seasons, so it buries itself in the earth
and coats its body in a mucus cocoon. It can survive like this for years 
until being resuscitated by the next big rainstorm. Amphibious fishes use powerful fins 
to move on land and clever tools to navigate as they go. The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, 
no bigger than a few centimeters, scales hundred-meter-tall 
Hawaiian waterfalls, inching its way up by alternately 
attaching the suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins. To find water while on land, 
the mummichog, like most amphibious fishes, 
is on the lookout for reflective surfaces. Other species, like mosquitofish, exercise their inner ear to determine 
where they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ asks about the sense that fish use to orient out of the water, with options including vision, taste, balance, and all of the above. The correct answer is "all of the above," implying that different fish species use different senses to navigate on land.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. It asks how mosquitofish navigate on land to find water and mentions the use of their inner ear to determine their orientation on a slope and move downhill. Although this question is specific to mosquitofish and does not cover all the senses mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

However, it's worth noting that Question 9 also mentions the use of taste buds by walking catfish to navigate on land, which is another sense mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. But since Question 7 is more focused on the navigation aspect, it is considered the most similar.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only provides a specific example of why a particular fish species moves onto land, rather than addressing the broader question of reasons for emersion.

A more suitable match is not present among the provided generated MCQs, as none of them directly address the question of which option is NOT a reason for emersion. However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the content and intent, I would choose Question 2, with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,
Crispy and Chewy, are out strolling 
when they’re caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, 
he decides that, instead of simply eating them, he’ll put their friendship 
to the test with a cruel dilemma. He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether
he’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know what the other
chose until their decisions are locked in. If both choose to spare the other, the fox
will eat just one of each of their limbs; if one chooses to spare 
while the other sacrifices, the sparer will be fully eaten, while the traitor will run away
with all his limbs intact. Finally, if both choose to sacrifice,
the fox will eat 3 limbs from each. In game theory, this scenario 
is called the “Prisoner's Dilemma.” To figure out how these gingerbread men 
will act in their perfect rationality, we can map the outcomes of each decision. The rows represent Crispy’s choices,
and the columns are Chewy’s. Meanwhile, the numbers in each cell represent the outcomes 
of their decisions, as measured in the number 
of limbs each would keep: So do we expect their friendship 
to last the game? First, let’s consider Chewy’s options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run
away scot-free by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy sacrifices him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs
if he also sacrifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome
by choosing to sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. This is the standard conclusion
of the Prisoner's Dilemma: the two characters will
betray one another. Their strategy to unconditionally
sacrifice their companion is what game theorists
call the “Nash Equilibrium," meaning that neither can gain
by deviating from it. Crispy and Chewy act accordingly and the smug fox runs off 
with a belly full of gingerbread, leaving the two former friends
with just one leg to stand on. Normally, this is where
the story would end, but a wizard happened to be watching
the whole mess unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy that, 
as punishment for betraying each other, they’re doomed to repeat this dilemma
for the rest of their lives, starting with all four limbs
at each sunrise. Now what happens? This is called an Infinite Prisoner’s 
Dilemma, and it’s a literal game changer. That’s because the gingerbread men 
can now use their future decisions as bargaining chips for the present ones. Consider this strategy: both agree 
to spare each other every day. If one ever chooses to sacrifice, the other will retaliate by choosing 
“sacrifice” for the rest of eternity. So is that enough to get these
poor sentient baked goods to agree to cooperate? To figure that out, we have to factor
in another consideration: the gingerbread men probably care
about the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future
limbs by some number, which we’ll call delta. This is similar to the idea of inflation 
eroding the value of money. If delta is one half, on day one they care about day 2 limbs
half as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs 1 quarter as much 
as day 1 limbs, and so on. A delta of 0 means that they don’t care 
about their future limbs at all, so they’ll repeat their initial choice
of mutual sacrifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, 
they’ll do anything possible to avoid the pain of infinite triple limb 
consumption, which means they’ll choose
to spare each other. At some point in between
they could go either way. We can find out where that point is by writing the infinite series 
that represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other,
and solving for delta. That yields 1/3, meaning that as long
as Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at least 1/3 as much as today, it’s optimal for them 
to spare and cooperate forever. This analysis isn’t unique
to cookies and wizards; we see it play out in real-life situations like trade negotiations
and international politics. Rational leaders must assume 
that the decisions they make today will impact those of their adversaries 
tomorrow. Selfishness may win out in the short-term,
but with the proper incentives, peaceful cooperation is not only possible,
but demonstrably and mathematically ideal. As for the gingerbread men, 
their eternity may be pretty crumby, but so long as they go out on a limb, their friendship will never 
again be half-baked.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What is the term for the strategy where both Crispy and Chewy choose to sacrifice each other, resulting in the best outcome for each individual, but not for both?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the predicted outcome of the finite Prisoner's Dilemma.

A closer match can be inferred from the content of the generated MCQs, specifically:

**Question 2: In the Prisoner's Dilemma, what is the outcome if both Crispy and Chewy choose to spare each other?**

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ but does not directly ask about the predicted outcome. However, we can infer that if the gingerbread men do not choose to spare each other, they will not cooperate.

Considering the options and content of the generated MCQs, the most similar one would be a question that asks about the predicted outcome of the finite Prisoner's Dilemma. Unfortunately, such a question is not explicitly present among the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the given options, I would select:

**Question 3**

But please note that this is not a perfect match.

If I were to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

**New Question: What is the predicted outcome for the gingerbread men in the finite Prisoner's Dilemma?**
Options: A. They will cooperate and spare each other., B. One will cooperate, but the other will sacrifice., C. They will never cooperate and will sacrifice each other., D. They will try to negotiate with the fox.

This new question directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, based on the provided generated MCQs, I will stick with my initial answer:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. However, the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the relationship between the discount factor and the incentive to cooperate.

A more suitable match can be found by analyzing the content and intent of each generated MCQ. Question 6 discusses the delta value but does not address the incentive to cooperate. Question 5 explains the concept of discounting but does not relate it to cooperation.

However, Question 7 addresses the threshold value of delta for cooperation but does not explicitly state the relationship between the discount factor and the incentive to cooperate in the options.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, a new question or a modification to an existing question would be more suitable to match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

Among the existing questions, Question 7 is the closest match, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ. If we had to choose from the existing questions, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 7.

However, please note that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between the discount factor and the incentive to cooperate, as stated in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7, but with the caveat that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,
Crispy and Chewy, are out strolling 
when they’re caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, 
he decides that, instead of simply eating them, he’ll put their friendship 
to the test with a cruel dilemma. He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether
he’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know what the other
chose until their decisions are locked in. If both choose to spare the other, the fox
will eat just one of each of their limbs; if one chooses to spare 
while the other sacrifices, the sparer will be fully eaten, while the traitor will run away
with all his limbs intact. Finally, if both choose to sacrifice,
the fox will eat 3 limbs from each. In game theory, this scenario 
is called the “Prisoner's Dilemma.” To figure out how these gingerbread men 
will act in their perfect rationality, we can map the outcomes of each decision. The rows represent Crispy’s choices,
and the columns are Chewy’s. Meanwhile, the numbers in each cell represent the outcomes 
of their decisions, as measured in the number 
of limbs each would keep: So do we expect their friendship 
to last the game? First, let’s consider Chewy’s options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run
away scot-free by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy sacrifices him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs
if he also sacrifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome
by choosing to sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. This is the standard conclusion
of the Prisoner's Dilemma: the two characters will
betray one another. Their strategy to unconditionally
sacrifice their companion is what game theorists
call the “Nash Equilibrium," meaning that neither can gain
by deviating from it. Crispy and Chewy act accordingly and the smug fox runs off 
with a belly full of gingerbread, leaving the two former friends
with just one leg to stand on. Normally, this is where
the story would end, but a wizard happened to be watching
the whole mess unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy that, 
as punishment for betraying each other, they’re doomed to repeat this dilemma
for the rest of their lives, starting with all four limbs
at each sunrise. Now what happens? This is called an Infinite Prisoner’s 
Dilemma, and it’s a literal game changer. That’s because the gingerbread men 
can now use their future decisions as bargaining chips for the present ones. Consider this strategy: both agree 
to spare each other every day. If one ever chooses to sacrifice, the other will retaliate by choosing 
“sacrifice” for the rest of eternity. So is that enough to get these
poor sentient baked goods to agree to cooperate? To figure that out, we have to factor
in another consideration: the gingerbread men probably care
about the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future
limbs by some number, which we’ll call delta. This is similar to the idea of inflation 
eroding the value of money. If delta is one half, on day one they care about day 2 limbs
half as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs 1 quarter as much 
as day 1 limbs, and so on. A delta of 0 means that they don’t care 
about their future limbs at all, so they’ll repeat their initial choice
of mutual sacrifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, 
they’ll do anything possible to avoid the pain of infinite triple limb 
consumption, which means they’ll choose
to spare each other. At some point in between
they could go either way. We can find out where that point is by writing the infinite series 
that represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other,
and solving for delta. That yields 1/3, meaning that as long
as Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at least 1/3 as much as today, it’s optimal for them 
to spare and cooperate forever. This analysis isn’t unique
to cookies and wizards; we see it play out in real-life situations like trade negotiations
and international politics. Rational leaders must assume 
that the decisions they make today will impact those of their adversaries 
tomorrow. Selfishness may win out in the short-term,
but with the proper incentives, peaceful cooperation is not only possible,
but demonstrably and mathematically ideal. As for the gingerbread men, 
their eternity may be pretty crumby, but so long as they go out on a limb, their friendship will never 
again be half-baked.

**Transcript**:
In the 1980s, a bonobo named Kanzi learned to communicate with humans
to an unprecedented extent— not through speech or gestures, but using a keyboard of abstract symbols
representing objects and actions. By pointing to several of these in order,
he created sequences to make requests, answer verbal questions 
from human researchers, and refer to objects 
that weren’t physically present. Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate 
controversy over one question: had Kanzi learned language? What we call language is something 
more specific than communication. Language is about sharing 
what’s in our minds: stories, opinions, questions, 
the past or future, imagined times or places, ideas. It is fundamentally open-ended, and can be used to say 
an unlimited number of things. Many researchers are convinced 
that only humans have language, that the calls and gestures other species
use to communicate are not language. Each of these calls and gestures generally
corresponds to a specific message, for a limited total number of messages that aren’t combined 
into more complex ideas. For example, a monkey species 
might have a specific warning call that corresponds to a particular predator,
like a snake— but with language, there are countless 
ways to say “watch out for the snake.” So far no animal communication seems 
to have the open-endedness of human language. We don’t know for sure what’s going
on in animals’ heads, and it's possible this definition 
of language, or our ways of measuring it,
don’t apply to them. But as far as we know, 
only humans have language. And while humans speak 
around 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language, indicating that the biological machinery
underlying language is common to all of us. So what does language mean for humanity? What does it allow us to do, 
and how did we come to have it? Exactly when we acquired this capacity
is still an open question. Chimps and bonobos 
are our closest living relatives, but the lineage leading to humans 
split from the other great apes more than four million years ago. In between, there were many species—
all of them now extinct, which makes it very difficult to know
if they had language or anything like it. Great apes give one potential clue 
to the origins of language, though: it may have started as gesture 
rather than speech. Great apes gesture to each other 
in the wild much more freely than they vocalize. Language may have begun to take shape
during the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago, 
with the emergence of the genus Homo that eventually gave rise 
to our own species, homo sapiens. Brain size tripled, and bipedalism 
freed the hands for communication. There may have been a transition 
from gestural communication to gestural language— from pointing to objects 
and pantomiming actions— to more efficient, abstract signing. The abstraction of gestural communication
would have removed the need for visuals, setting the stage for a transition 
to spoken language. That transition would have 
likely come later, though. Articulate speech depends 
on a vocal tract of a particular shape. Even our closest ancestors, 
the Neanderthals and Denisovans, had vocal tracts that were not optimal, though they likely had 
some vocal capacity, and possibly even language. Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal. Spoken words free the hands for activities
such as tool use and transport. So it may have been 
the emergence of speech, not of language itself, that led 
to the dominance of our species. Language is so intimately tied to complex
thought, perception, and motor functions that it’s difficult to untangle
its biological origins. Some of the biggest mysteries remain: to what extent did language 
as a capacity shape humanity, and to what extent did humanity 
shape language? What came first, the vast number 
of possible scenarios we can envisage, or our ability to share them?

don’t apply to them. But as far as we know, 
only humans have language. And while humans speak 
around 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language, indicating that the biological machinery
underlying language is common to all of us. So what does language mean for humanity? What does it allow us to do, 
and how did we come to have it? Exactly when we acquired this capacity
is still an open question. Chimps and bonobos 
are our closest living relatives, but the lineage leading to humans 
split from the other great apes more than four million years ago. In between, there were many species—
all of them now extinct, which makes it very difficult to know
if they had language or anything like it. Great apes give one potential clue 
to the origins of language, though: it may have started as gesture 
rather than speech. Great apes gesture to each other 
in the wild much more freely than they vocalize. Language may have begun to take shape
during the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago, 
with the emergence of the genus Homo that eventually gave rise 
to our own species, homo sapiens. Brain size tripled, and bipedalism 
freed the hands for communication. There may have been a transition 
from gestural communication to gestural language— from pointing to objects 
and pantomiming actions— to more efficient, abstract signing. The abstraction of gestural communication
would have removed the need for visuals, setting the stage for a transition 
to spoken language. That transition would have 
likely come later, though. Articulate speech depends 
on a vocal tract of a particular shape. Even our closest ancestors, 
the Neanderthals and Denisovans, had vocal tracts that were not optimal, though they likely had 
some vocal capacity, and possibly even language. Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal. Spoken words free the hands for activities
such as tool use and transport. So it may have been 
the emergence of speech, not of language itself, that led 
to the dominance of our species. Language is so intimately tied to complex
thought, perception, and motor functions that it’s difficult to untangle
its biological origins. Some of the biggest mysteries remain: to what extent did language 
as a capacity shape humanity, and to what extent did humanity 
shape language? What came first, the vast number 
of possible scenarios we can envisage, or our ability to share them?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What does the fact that any child can learn any language suggest about the biological machinery underlying language?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match is not found in the provided generated MCQs, but Question 4 mentions "any child can learn any language," which is related to the idea that "humans speak around 7,000 distinct languages" mentioned in the transcript.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the number of languages spoken by humans. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I must provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but a related question is:

**Transcript**:
In the 1980s, a bonobo named Kanzi learned to communicate with humans
to an unprecedented extent— not through speech or gestures, but using a keyboard of abstract symbols
representing objects and actions. By pointing to several of these in order,
he created sequences to make requests, answer verbal questions 
from human researchers, and refer to objects 
that weren’t physically present. Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate 
controversy over one question: had Kanzi learned language? What we call language is something 
more specific than communication. Language is about sharing 
what’s in our minds: stories, opinions, questions, 
the past or future, imagined times or places, ideas. It is fundamentally open-ended, and can be used to say 
an unlimited number of things. Many researchers are convinced 
that only humans have language, that the calls and gestures other species
use to communicate are not language. Each of these calls and gestures generally
corresponds to a specific message, for a limited total number of messages that aren’t combined 
into more complex ideas. For example, a monkey species 
might have a specific warning call that corresponds to a particular predator,
like a snake— but with language, there are countless 
ways to say “watch out for the snake.” So far no animal communication seems 
to have the open-endedness of human language. We don’t know for sure what’s going
on in animals’ heads, and it's possible this definition

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Camille Martínez Hi. You might have noticed
that I have half a beard. It's not because I lost a bet. Many years ago, I was badly burned. Most of my body is covered with scars, including the right side of my face. I just don't have hair.
That's just how it happened. It looks symmetrical, but almost. Anyway, now that we discussed facial hair, let's move to social science. And in particular, I want us to think
about where is the potential for humanity and where we are now. And if you think about it,
there's a big gap between where we think we could be
and where we are, and it's in all kinds of areas. So let me ask you: How many of you in the last month
have eaten more than you think you should? Just kind of general. OK. How many of you in the last month have
exercised less than you think you should? OK, and for how many of you
has raising your hands twice been the most exercise you got today? (Laughter) How many of you have ever
texted while driving? OK, we're getting honest.
Let's test your honesty. How many people here in the last month have not always washed your hands
when you left the bathroom? (Laughter) A little less honest. By the way, it's interesting how we're
willing to admit texting and driving but not washing our hands,
that's difficult. (Laughter) We can go on and on. The problem, the topic is
that there's lots of things when we know what we could do -- we could be very, very different,
but we're acting in a very different way. And when we think
how do we bridge that gap, the usual answer is, "Just tell people." For example, just tell people
that texting and driving is dangerous. Did you know it's dangerous?
You should stop doing it. You tell people something
is dangerous, and they will stop. Texting and driving is one example. Another very sad example
is that in the US, we spend between seven
and eight hundred million dollars a year on what's called "financial literacy." And what do we get
as a consequence of that? There was recently a study that looked
at all the research ever to be conducted on financial literacy --
what's called a meta-analysis. And what they found is that
when you tell people, you teach them financial literacy, they learn and they remember. But do people execute? Not so much. The improvement is about
three or four percent immediately after the course, and then it goes down. And at the end of the day, the improvement is about 0.1 percent -- not zero, but as humanly close
to zero as possible. (Laughter) So that's the sad news. The sad news is, giving
information to people is just not a good recipe
to change behavior. What is? Well, social science
has made lots of strides, and the basic insight is that
if we want to change behavior, we have to change the environment. The right way is not to change people,
it's to change the environment. And I want to present a very simpleminded
model of how to think about it: it's to think about behavioral change in the same way that we think about
sending a rocket to space. When we think about
sending a rocket to space, we want to do two main things. The first one is to reduce friction. We want to take the rocket
and have as little friction as possible so it's the most aerodynamic possible. And the second thing is we want
to load as much fuel as possible, to give it the most amount
of motivation, energy to do its task. And behavior change is the same thing. So let's first talk about friction. In this particular case study
I'll tell you about, there's a pharmacy, an online pharmacy. Imagine you go to your doctor. You have a long-term illness, your doctor prescribes
to you a medication, you sign up for this online pharmacy and you get your medication
in the mail every 90 days. Every 90 days, medication,
medication, medication. And this online pharmacy
wants to switch people from branded medication
to generic medication. So they send people letters, and they say, "Please, please, please,
switch to generics. You will save money, we will save money,
your employer will save money." And what do people do? Nothing. So they try all kinds of things
and nothing happens. So for one year, they give people
an amazing offer. They send people a letter, and they say, "If you switch to generics now,
it will be free for a whole year." Free for a whole year. Amazing! What percentage of people
do you think switched? Less than 10 percent. At this point, they show up to my office. And they come to complain. Why did they pick me? I wrote a couple of papers
on the "allure of free." In those papers, we showed
that if you reduce the price of something for, let's say, 10 cents to one cent,
nothing much happens. You reduce it from one cent to zero,
now people get excited. (Laughter) And they said, "Look, we read these
papers on 'free,' we gave 'free.' Not working as we expected. What's going on?" I said, "You know, maybe
it's a question of friction." They said, "What do you mean?" I said, "People are starting with branded. They can do nothing and end with branded. To move to generic, they have to choose
generic over branded, but they also have to do something. They have to return the letter." So this is what we call
a "confounded design." Two things are happening at the same time. It's branded versus generic, but it's doing nothing
versus doing something. So I said, "Why don't we switch it? Why don't we send people a letter
and say, 'We're switching you to generics. You don't need to do anything. If you want to stay with branded,
please return the letter.'" (Laughter) Right? What do you think happened? Lawyers, lawyers happened. (Laughter) It turns out, this is illegal. (Laughter) By the way, for brainstorming
and creativity, doing things that are illegal
and immoral, it's fine, as long as it's just
in the brainstorming phase. (Laughter) But this was the purity of the idea, because the initial design was
the branded had the no-action benefit. In my illegal, immoral design,
generic had the no-action benefit. But they agreed to give people
a T-intersection: send people a letter and say, "If you don't return this letter, we will be forced
to stop your medications. But when you return the letter,
you could choose branded at this price, generic at this price." Now people had to take an action. They were on even footing. Right? It wasn't that one had
the no-action benefit. What percentage do you think switched? The vast majority switched. So what does it tell us? Do people like generics,
or do we like branded? We hate returning letters. (Laughter) This is the story of friction:
small things really matter. And friction is about taking
the desired behavior and saying: Where do we have
too much friction so it's slowing people down
from acting on it? And every time you see
that the desired behavior and the easy behavior are not aligned, it means we want to try and realign them. That's the first part.
We talked about friction. Now let's talk about motivation. In this particular study, we were trying to get very poor people
in a slum called Kibera in Kenya to save a little bit of money
for a rainy day. You know, if you're very, very poor,
you have no extra money, you live hand to mouth, and from time to time, bad things happen. And when something bad happens,
you have nothing to draw on, you borrow. The Kibera people can borrow at sometimes
up to 10 percent interest a week. And then, of course,
it's really hard to get out of it. You live hand to mouth,
something bad happens, you borrow, things get worse
and worse and worse. So we wanted people to keep
a little bit of money for a rainy day. And we thought about
what is the motivation, what is the fuel that we need to add? And we tried all kinds of things. Some people, we texted them
once a week and said, "Please try to save 100 shillings" --
about a dollar -- "this week." Some people, we sent a text message
as if it came from their kids. So it said, "Hi Mom, hi Dad,
this is little Joey" -- whatever the name of the kid was -- "Try and save 100 shillings this week
for the future of our family." Right? I'm Jewish, a little bit
of guilt always works. (Laughter) Some people got 10 percent. "Save up to a hundred shillings,
we'll give you 10 percent." Some people got 20 percent. Some people got also
10 percent and 20 percent, but they got it with loss aversion. What is loss aversion? Loss aversion is the idea
that we hate losing more than we enjoy gaining. Now, think about somebody
who is in a 10-percent condition and they put 40 shillings in. They put 40 shillings,
we give them four more, they say thank you very much. That person gave up six. They could have gotten six more
if they gave a hundred, but they don't see it. So we created what we call pre-match. We put the 10 shillings in
at the beginning of the week. We said, "It's waiting for you!" And then if somebody puts 40 in,
we say, "Oh, you put 40 in, we're leaving four,
and we're taking six back." So in both cases, pre-match or post-match, people get 10 percent. But in the pre-match, they see the money they did not match
leaving their account. So we have text, text from kids,
10 percent, 20 percent, pre-match, post-match. And we had one more condition. It was a coin about this size, with 24 numbers written on it. And we asked them to put the coin
somewhere in their hut, and every week, take a knife
and scratch the number for that week -- week one, two, three, four -- scratch it like a minus
if they didn't save and scratch it up and down if they saved. Now, think to yourself: Which one of those methods
do you think worked the best? Text, text from the kids,
10 percent, 20 percent, beginning of the week,
end of the week, and the coin? I'll tell you what
the average people think. We've done these studies of prediction, both in the US and in Kenya. People think that 20 percent
will get a lot of action, 10 percent less, the rest of it will do nothing -- kids, coin, doesn't matter. People think loss aversion
will have a small effect. What actually happened? Sending a text reminder once a week helps a lot. Good news! This program lasted six months.
People forget. Reminding people is great. Ten percent at the end
of the week helped some more. Financial incentives work. Twenty percent at the end of the week --
just like 10 percent, no difference. Ten percent in the beginning of the week helps some more. Loss aversion works. Twenty percent in
the beginning of the week, just like 10 percent in the beginning
of the week, no difference. And the text message from the kids
was just as effective as 20 percent plus loss aversion -- which is amazing, right? It's amazing how motivating
messages from kids were. And one conclusion is
we don't use kids enough. (Laughter) And, of course, I don't mean
in a child labor sense. But if you think about
parents and their kids, we are the best that we can for our kids, and we think about the future, and I think we should think about how to use that amazing
source of motivation to get parents to behave in a better way. But the big surprise
of this study was the coin. The coin basically doubled savings
compared to everything else. And now the question is: Why?
What was it about the coin? So I'll tell you how I started
thinking about the coin, and then we'll come back to it. So you know, when I do research
on, let's say, buying coffee, I don't need to go anywhere.
I can sit in my office. I've bought enough coffee.
I know how it works. The details, I'm familiar with. When you do research in some
of the poorest places in the world, you have to go and visit
and see what's going on and get some insight
about how the system works. And on that particular day, I'm in a place called Soweto
in South Africa, and I'm sitting in a place
that sells funeral insurance. You know, in the US people spend
crazy amounts of money on weddings? In South Africa, it's funerals. People spend up to a year
or two years of income on funerals. And I sit in this place -- by the way, before you judge the South
Africans as being irrational with this, I just want to remind you that spending a lot of money
on funerals compared to weddings, at least you know for sure
you only have one. (Laughter) OK, so I sit in this place
that sells funeral insurance. And this guy comes in with his son --
his son is about 12 -- and he buys funeral insurance for a week. It will cover 90 percent
of his funeral expense only if he dies in the next seven days. Right? These are very poor people,
they buy small amounts of insurance and small amount of soap and such. And he gets that certificate, and in a very ceremonious way,
he gives it to his son. And as he gives it to his son,
I think to myself, why the ceremony? What is this father doing? Now, think about the breadwinner
that decides on that particular day to direct some money
into insurance or savings. What is the family going to see tonight? They're going to see less. Right? At that level of poverty, there'll
be less food, less kerosene, less water -- something less tonight. And what his father was doing
and what our coin was trying to do is to say, yes, there's less
food on the table, but there's another activity. You see, what happened is, there are
many good, important economic activities, like savings and insurance,
that are invisible. And now the question is:
How do we make them visible? So let's go back to our rocket model. We have to, first of all,
look at the system and see where there's little things
we can fix, with friction, where is there
that we can remove friction? And then the next thing we want to do
is to think broadly about the system, and say: What other motivations
can we bring in? And that's a much more difficult exercise, and we don't always know
what would work best. Is it going to be money?
Is it going to be loss aversion? Is it going to be
something that is visible? We don't know, and we have
to try different things. We also have to realize that
our intuition sometimes misleads us. We don't always necessarily know
what would work the best. So if we think about this gap between where we could be
and where we are, it's a really sad thing to see this gap
and to think about it. But the good news is,
there's lots we can do. Some of the changes are easy,
some of the changes are more complex. But if we'll attack each problem directly, not by just providing
more information to people but trying to change the friction, add motivation, I think we can ... Can we close the gap? No. But can we get much better?
Absolutely, yes. Thank you very much. (Applause)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In the savannahs of Kenya, two female 
northern white rhinos, Nájin and Fatu, munch contentedly on the grass. At the time of this video’s publication, these are the last two known 
northern white rhinos left on Earth. Their species is functionally extinct— without a male, 
Nájin and Fatu can’t reproduce. And yet, there’s still hope to revive 
the northern white rhino. How can that be? The story starts about 50 years ago, when poachers began illegally hunting 
thousands of rhinos across Africa for their horns. This, combined with civil wars 
in their territory, decimated northern white rhino 
populations. Concerned conservationists began trying 
to breed them in captivity in the 1970s, collecting and storing semen from males. Only four rhinos were ultimately born 
through the ambitious breeding program. Nájin, and her daughter Fatu 
were the last two. In 2014, conservationists discovered 
that neither can have a calf. Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu, 
she now has weak hindlegs, which could harm her health 
if she became pregnant again. Fatu, meanwhile, 
has a degenerated uterine lining. Then, the last northern white rhino male 
of the species, Sudan, died in 2018. But there was one glimmer of hope: 
artificial reproduction. With no living males and no females 
able to carry a pregnancy, this is a complicated and risky process 
to say the least. Though scientists had stored semen, 
they would have to collect the eggs— a complex procedure that requires a female
to be sedated for up to two hours. Then, they’d create a viable embryo 
in the lab— something that had never been done before,
and no one knew how to do. Even that was just the beginning— a surrogate mother 
of another rhino species would have to carry the embryo to term. Females of a closely related species, 
the southern white rhino, became both the key to developing 
a rhino embryo in a lab and the leading candidates 
for surrogate mothers. Northern and southern white rhinos 
diverged about a million of years ago into separate— though still 
closely-related— species. They inhabit different regions, and have 
slightly different physical traits. In a fortunate coincidence, 
several female southern white rhinos needed treatment 
for their own reproductive problems, and researchers could collect eggs 
as part of that treatment. In Dvůr Králové Zoo in October 2015, experts of IZW Berlin began collecting 
eggs from southern white rhinos and sending them to Avantea, an animal 
reproduction laboratory in Italy. There, scientists developed and perfected 
a technique to create a viable embryo. Once they mastered the technique, researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’s 
eggs on August 22, 2019 and flew them to Italy. Three days later, they fertilized 
the eggs with sperm from a northern white rhino male. After another week, two of the eggs 
made it to the stage of development when the embryo can be frozen 
and preserved for future. Another collection in December 2019 
produced one more embryo. As of early 2020, the plan is to collect 
Nájin and Fatu’s eggs three times a year if they’re healthy enough. In the meantime, 
researchers are looking for promising southern white rhino 
surrogate mothers— ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy 
to term before. The surrogacy plan 
is somewhat of a leap of faith— southern and northern white rhinos 
have interbred both during the last glacial period 
and more recently in 1977, so researchers are optimistic 
a southern white rhino would be able to carry 
a northern white rhino to term. Also, the two species’ pregnancies 
are the same length. Still, transferring an embryo 
to a rhino is tricky because of the shape of the cervix. The ultimate goal, 
which will take decades, is to establish a breeding population 
of northern white rhinos in their original range. Studies suggest that we have samples 
from enough individuals to recreate a population with the genetic 
diversity the species had a century ago. Though the specifics 
of this effort are unique, as more species face critical endangerment
or functional extinction, it’s also an arena for big questions: do we have a responsibility to try 
to bring species back from the brink, especially when human actions 
brought them there in the first place? Are there limits to the effort 
we should expend on saving animals threatened 
with extinction?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of northern white rhinos born and raised in human care. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions Nájin and Fatu's inability to reproduce naturally and provides some context about their background.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that discusses the breeding program or the number of northern white rhinos in captivity. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6, which asks about the ultimate goal of the conservation effort for northern white rhinos. This question mentions establishing a breeding population, which is related to the breeding program mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of northern white rhinos born and raised in human care.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (weak match)

a rhino embryo in a lab and the leading candidates 
for surrogate mothers. Northern and southern white rhinos 
diverged about a million of years ago into separate— though still 
closely-related— species. They inhabit different regions, and have 
slightly different physical traits. In a fortunate coincidence, 
several female southern white rhinos needed treatment 
for their own reproductive problems, and researchers could collect eggs 
as part of that treatment. In Dvůr Králové Zoo in October 2015, experts of IZW Berlin began collecting 
eggs from southern white rhinos and sending them to Avantea, an animal 
reproduction laboratory in Italy. There, scientists developed and perfected 
a technique to create a viable embryo. Once they mastered the technique, researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’s 
eggs on August 22, 2019 and flew them to Italy. Three days later, they fertilized 
the eggs with sperm from a northern white rhino male. After another week, two of the eggs 
made it to the stage of development when the embryo can be frozen 
and preserved for future. Another collection in December 2019 
produced one more embryo. As of early 2020, the plan is to collect 
Nájin and Fatu’s eggs three times a year if they’re healthy enough. In the meantime, 
researchers are looking for promising southern white rhino 
surrogate mothers— ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy 
to term before. The surrogacy plan 
is somewhat of a leap of faith— southern and northern white rhinos 
have interbred both during the last glacial period 
and more recently in 1977, so researchers are optimistic 
a southern white rhino would be able to carry 
a northern white rhino to term. Also, the two species’ pregnancies 
are the same length. Still, transferring an embryo 
to a rhino is tricky because of the shape of the cervix. The ultimate goal, 
which will take decades, is to establish a breeding population 
of northern white rhinos in their original range. Studies suggest that we have samples 
from enough individuals to recreate a population with the genetic 
diversity the species had a century ago. Though the specifics 
of this effort are unique, as more species face critical endangerment
or functional extinction, it’s also an arena for big questions: do we have a responsibility to try 
to bring species back from the brink, especially when human actions 
brought them there in the first place? Are there limits to the effort 
we should expend on saving animals threatened 
with extinction?

**Transcript**:
In the savannahs of Kenya, two female 
northern white rhinos, Nájin and Fatu, munch contentedly on the grass. At the time of this video’s publication, these are the last two known 
northern white rhinos left on Earth. Their species is functionally extinct— without a male, 
Nájin and Fatu can’t reproduce. And yet, there’s still hope to revive 
the northern white rhino. How can that be? The story starts about 50 years ago, when poachers began illegally hunting 
thousands of rhinos across Africa for their horns. This, combined with civil wars 
in their territory, decimated northern white rhino 
populations. Concerned conservationists began trying 
to breed them in captivity in the 1970s, collecting and storing semen from males. Only four rhinos were ultimately born 
through the ambitious breeding program. Nájin, and her daughter Fatu 
were the last two. In 2014, conservationists discovered 
that neither can have a calf. Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu, 
she now has weak hindlegs, which could harm her health 
if she became pregnant again. Fatu, meanwhile, 
has a degenerated uterine lining. Then, the last northern white rhino male 
of the species, Sudan, died in 2018. But there was one glimmer of hope: 
artificial reproduction. With no living males and no females 
able to carry a pregnancy, this is a complicated and risky process 
to say the least. Though scientists had stored semen, 
they would have to collect the eggs— a complex procedure that requires a female
to be sedated for up to two hours. Then, they’d create a viable embryo 
in the lab— something that had never been done before,
and no one knew how to do. Even that was just the beginning— a surrogate mother 
of another rhino species would have to carry the embryo to term. Females of a closely related species, 
the southern white rhino, became both the key to developing 
a rhino embryo in a lab and the leading candidates 
for surrogate mothers. Northern and southern white rhinos 
diverged about a million of years ago into separate— though still 
closely-related— species. They inhabit different regions, and have 
slightly different physical traits. In a fortunate coincidence,

**Transcript**:
Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, 
stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army 
singlehandedly— all for the sake of a single bull. The army in question belonged 
to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession
of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture 
the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Unfortunately, the King of Ulster 
had chosen this moment to force the goddess Macha to race 
her chariot while pregnant. In retaliation, she struck down him 
and his entire army with stomach cramps that eerily resembled childbirth—
all except Cú Chulainn. Though he was the best warrior in Ulster, Cú Chulainn knew he could not take on
Queen Meadhbh’s whole army at once. He invoked the sacred rite 
of single combat in order to fight 
the intruders one by one. But as Queen Meadhbh’s army 
approached, one thing worried him 
more than the grueling ordeal ahead. Years before, Cú Chulainn had travelled 
to Scotland to train with the renowned 
warrior Scáthach. There, he met a young warrior 
from Connaught named Ferdiad. They lived and trained side-by-side,
and soon became close friends. When they returned 
to their respective homes, Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad found themselves 
on opposite sides of a war. Cú Chulainn knew Ferdiad 
was marching in Meadhbh’s army, and that if he succeeded 
in fending off her troops, they would eventually meet. Day after day, Cú Chulainn 
defended Ulster alone. He sent the heads of some 
of his adversaries back to Meadhbh’s camp, while the rushing waters of the ford 
carried others away. At times, he slipped into a trance 
and slayed hundreds of soldiers in a row. Whenever he saw the queen in the distance,
he hurled stones at her— never quite hitting her, but once coming close enough 
to knock a squirrel off her shoulder. Back at the Connaught camp, 
Ferdiad was laying low, doing everything he could 
to avoid the moment when he’d have to face
his best friend in combat. But the Queen was impatient 
to get her hands on the prize bull, and she knew Ferdiad was 
her best chance to defeat Cú Chulainn. So she goaded him 
and questioned his honor until he had no choice but to fight. The two faced off at the ford, matching 
each other exactly in strength and skill no matter what weapons they used. Then, on the third day of their fight,
Ferdiad began to gain the upper hand over the exhausted Cu Chulainn. But Cú Chulainn had one last trick 
up his sleeve: their teacher had shared 
a secret with him alone. She told him how 
to summon the Gáe Bulg, a magical spear fashioned 
from the bones of sea monsters that lay at the bottom of the ocean. Cu Chulainn called the spear, 
stabbed Ferdiad to death, and collapsed. Meadhbh seized her chance 
and swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering
from their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadhbh
crossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown bull with her. Once home, Meadhbh 
demanded another battle, this time between the brown bull 
and her husband’s white bull. The bulls were well matched, 
and struggled into the night, dragging each other all over Ireland. At long last, the brown bull 
killed the white bull, and Queen Meadhbh was finally satisfied. But the brown bull’s victory 
meant nothing to him. He was tired, injured, and devastated. Soon after, he died of a broken heart, 
leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged 
by Meadhbh’s war for years to come.

**Transcript**:
Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, 
stood at the ford at Cooley, ready to face an entire army 
singlehandedly— all for the sake of a single bull. The army in question belonged 
to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession
of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture 
the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Unfortunately, the King of Ulster 
had chosen this moment to force the goddess Macha to race 
her chariot while pregnant. In retaliation, she struck down him 
and his entire army with stomach cramps that eerily resembled childbirth—
all except Cú Chulainn. Though he was the best warrior in Ulster, Cú Chulainn knew he could not take on
Queen Meadhbh’s whole army at once. He invoked the sacred rite 
of single combat in order to fight 
the intruders one by one. But as Queen Meadhbh’s army 
approached, one thing worried him 
more than the grueling ordeal ahead. Years before, Cú Chulainn had travelled 
to Scotland to train with the renowned 
warrior Scáthach. There, he met a young warrior 
from Connaught named Ferdiad. They lived and trained side-by-side,
and soon became close friends. When they returned 
to their respective homes, Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad found themselves 
on opposite sides of a war. Cú Chulainn knew Ferdiad 
was marching in Meadhbh’s army, and that if he succeeded 
in fending off her troops, they would eventually meet. Day after day, Cú Chulainn 
defended Ulster alone. He sent the heads of some 
of his adversaries back to Meadhbh’s camp, while the rushing waters of the ford 
carried others away. At times, he slipped into a trance 
and slayed hundreds of soldiers in a row. Whenever he saw the queen in the distance,
he hurled stones at her— never quite hitting her, but once coming close enough 
to knock a squirrel off her shoulder. Back at the Connaught camp, 
Ferdiad was laying low, doing everything he could 
to avoid the moment when he’d have to face
his best friend in combat. But the Queen was impatient 
to get her hands on the prize bull, and she knew Ferdiad was 
her best chance to defeat Cú Chulainn. So she goaded him 
and questioned his honor until he had no choice but to fight. The two faced off at the ford, matching 
each other exactly in strength and skill no matter what weapons they used. Then, on the third day of their fight,
Ferdiad began to gain the upper hand over the exhausted Cu Chulainn. But Cú Chulainn had one last trick 
up his sleeve: their teacher had shared 
a secret with him alone. She told him how 
to summon the Gáe Bulg, a magical spear fashioned 
from the bones of sea monsters that lay at the bottom of the ocean. Cu Chulainn called the spear, 
stabbed Ferdiad to death, and collapsed. Meadhbh seized her chance 
and swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering
from their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadhbh
crossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown bull with her. Once home, Meadhbh 
demanded another battle, this time between the brown bull 
and her husband’s white bull. The bulls were well matched, 
and struggled into the night, dragging each other all over Ireland. At long last, the brown bull 
killed the white bull, and Queen Meadhbh was finally satisfied. But the brown bull’s victory 
meant nothing to him. He was tired, injured, and devastated. Soon after, he died of a broken heart, 
leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged 
by Meadhbh’s war for years to come.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 4: What was the relationship between Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad before the war?**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match would be a question that asks about Cú Chulainn's training. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs.

But if I had to choose the most similar one based on the information provided in the options of the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

**None of the questions directly match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of mentioning Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad's relationship, which was formed during their training in Scotland.**

However, I must note that this is not a direct match.

If I really had to choose an index, I would say: **4** (with the caveat that it's not a direct match).

and swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering
from their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadhbh
crossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown bull with her. Once home, Meadhbh 
demanded another battle, this time between the brown bull 
and her husband’s white bull. The bulls were well matched, 
and struggled into the night, dragging each other all over Ireland. At long last, the brown bull 
killed the white bull, and Queen Meadhbh was finally satisfied. But the brown bull’s victory 
meant nothing to him. He was tired, injured, and devastated. Soon after, he died of a broken heart, 
leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged 
by Meadhbh’s war for years to come.

**Transcript**:
As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, 
one animal breaks the morning silence. Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem. Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce 
large three-dimensional structures, which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies that house and protect 
countless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life. Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many 
of the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact. This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system 
of social networks, parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive— and more of these fish 
means less seaweed. Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed. Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research, while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges. Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies for preserving these essential ecosystems.

of the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact. This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system 
of social networks, parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive— and more of these fish 
means less seaweed. Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed. Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research, while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges. Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies for preserving these essential ecosystems.

As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, 
one animal breaks the morning silence. Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem. Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce 
large three-dimensional structures, which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies that house and protect 
countless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life. Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many

**Transcript**:
In 2009, two researchers ran 
a simple experiment. They took everything we know 
about our solar system and calculated where every planet would be
up to 5 billion years in the future. To do so they ran over 2,000 
numerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions
except for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun,
modified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next. Shockingly, in about 1 percent 
of their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically 
that it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized
the entire inner solar system. This was no error; 
the astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system 
may be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing
property of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations 
that can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short 
when faced with more populated systems. It’s actually impossible to write down
all the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion
of three or more gravitating objects. Why? The issue lies in how many unknown
variables an n-body system contains. Thanks to Isaac Newton, 
we can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force 
acting between bodies. However, when trying to find a general 
solution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with 
a mathematical constraint: for each unknown, 
there must be at least one equation that independently describes it. Initially, a two-body system appears 
to have more unknown variables for position and velocity 
than equations of motion. However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position 
and velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center 
of gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns
and leaves us with a solvable system. With three or more orbiting objects 
in the picture, everything gets messier. Even with the same mathematical trick 
of considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns 
than equations describing them. There are simply too many variables
for this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution. But what does it actually look like 
for objects in our universe to move according to analytically 
unsolvable equations of motion? A system of three stars—
like Alpha Centauri— could come crashing
into one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit 
after a long time of apparent stability. Other than a few highly improbable 
stable configurations, almost every possible case 
is unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range
of potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences
in position and velocity. This behaviour is known 
as chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic 
of n-body systems. Such a system is still deterministic—
meaning there’s nothing random about it. If multiple systems start 
from the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result. But give one a little shove at the start,
and all bets are off. That’s clearly relevant 
for human space missions, when complicated orbits need 
to be calculated with great precision. Thankfully, continuous advancements
in computer simulations offer a number of ways
to avoid catastrophe. By approximating the solutions 
with increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion
of n-body systems on long time-scales. And if one body in a group 
of three is so light it exerts no significant force 
on the other two, the system behaves, with very good 
approximation, as a two-body system. This approach is known 
as the “restricted three-body problem.” It proves extremely useful 
in describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun 
gravitational field, or a small planet in the field 
of a black hole and a star. As for our solar system, 
you’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence
in its stability for at least the next 
several hundred million years. Though if another star, launched from across the galaxy, 
is on its way to us, all bets are off.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, two researchers ran 
a simple experiment. They took everything we know 
about our solar system and calculated where every planet would be
up to 5 billion years in the future. To do so they ran over 2,000 
numerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions
except for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun,
modified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next. Shockingly, in about 1 percent 
of their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically 
that it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized
the entire inner solar system. This was no error; 
the astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system 
may be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing
property of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations 
that can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short 
when faced with more populated systems. It’s actually impossible to write down
all the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion
of three or more gravitating objects. Why? The issue lies in how many unknown
variables an n-body system contains. Thanks to Isaac Newton, 
we can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force 
acting between bodies. However, when trying to find a general 
solution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with 
a mathematical constraint: for each unknown, 
there must be at least one equation that independently describes it. Initially, a two-body system appears 
to have more unknown variables for position and velocity 
than equations of motion. However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position 
and velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center 
of gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns
and leaves us with a solvable system. With three or more orbiting objects 
in the picture, everything gets messier. Even with the same mathematical trick 
of considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns 
than equations describing them. There are simply too many variables
for this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution. But what does it actually look like 
for objects in our universe to move according to analytically 
unsolvable equations of motion? A system of three stars—
like Alpha Centauri— could come crashing
into one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit 
after a long time of apparent stability. Other than a few highly improbable 
stable configurations, almost every possible case 
is unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range
of potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences
in position and velocity. This behaviour is known 
as chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic 
of n-body systems. Such a system is still deterministic—
meaning there’s nothing random about it. If multiple systems start 
from the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result. But give one a little shove at the start,
and all bets are off. That’s clearly relevant 
for human space missions, when complicated orbits need 
to be calculated with great precision. Thankfully, continuous advancements
in computer simulations offer a number of ways
to avoid catastrophe. By approximating the solutions 
with increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion
of n-body systems on long time-scales. And if one body in a group 
of three is so light it exerts no significant force 
on the other two, the system behaves, with very good 
approximation, as a two-body system. This approach is known 
as the “restricted three-body problem.” It proves extremely useful 
in describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun 
gravitational field, or a small planet in the field 
of a black hole and a star. As for our solar system, 
you’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence
in its stability for at least the next 
several hundred million years. Though if another star, launched from across the galaxy, 
is on its way to us, all bets are off.

**Transcript**:
You’re a biologist on a mission to keep the rare honeybee 
Apis Trifecta from going extinct. The last 60 bees of the species 
are in your terrarium. You’ve already constructed wire frames
of the appropriate size and shape. Now you need to turn 
them into working beehives by helping the bees fill 
every hex with wax. There are two ways to fill a given hex. The first is to place a bee into it. Once placed, a bee cannot 
be removed without killing it. The second: if at any point an unfilled hex has three
or more neighboring wax-filled hexes, the bees already in the hive 
will move in and transform it. Once the bees have transformed 
every hex in a hive, you can place an additional bee inside
and it’ll specialize into a queen. The hive, if well cared for, 
will eventually produce new bees and continue the species. If there are no hexes with three or more 
transformed neighbors, the bees will just sit and wait. And once a bee transforms a hex, 
it can never become a queen. You could put 59 bees in one wire hive,
wait till they transform all the hexes, and then create a queen. But then just one collapse 
would end the species. The more viable hives 
you can make now, the better. So how many can you make with 60 bees? Pause the video to figure
it out yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Answer in 0 What you're looking for here is some 
kind of self-sustaining chain reaction, where a small number of bees 
will transform an entire hive. The lower the number of bees needed,
the better. So how low can we go, 
and how can we engineer a chain reaction? Let’s start with the first question. There's a really clever approach to this, which involves counting the sides 
of the filled-in hexes, and examining their total perimeter. Let’s suppose we put bees 
in these three hexes. The total transformed 
perimeter has 18 sides. But the middle hex 
has three transformed neighbors, so the bees will transform it too. What happens to the perimeter? It’s still 18! And even after the bees transform the next
sets of hexes with three neighbors, it still won’t change. What’s going on here? Each hex that has at least three sides 
touching the bee-friendly space will remove those sides from the perimeter
when it transforms. Then it adds at most three new sides 
to the perimeter. So the perimeter of the transformed hexes
will either stay the same or shrink. The final perimeter 
of the entire hive is 54, so the total perimeter of the hexes 
we place bees in at the start must be at least 54 as well. Dividing that 54 by the six sides 
on each non-adjacent hex tells us it’ll take at least 9 bees 
to transform the entire hive. That’s a great start, but we still have the tough question 
of where the nine bees should go, and if we’ll need more. Let’s think smaller. We already know that three bees could
completely transform a hive this big. What about a slightly bigger one? The perimeter of this hive is 30, which means we’ll need 
at least 5 bees to fill it in. With 6 it’d be easy. Placing them like this would fill out 
the whole hive in just three steps. But we can do better! We don’t actually need to place 
a bee on this hex, since the other bees will transform
that spot on their own. It looks like we have 
the beginning of a pattern. Can we extend it to our full hive? That would mean placing 
our 9 bees like so. Once they get to work, 
they’ll create a chain reaction that fills in the center of the hive 
and extend it to its edges. Add a 10th bee to the completed hive 
and it becomes a queen. Repeat that process five more times and you’ve helped the last 60 members
of Apis trifecta create 6 producing hives. All in all, 
it’s a pretty good bee-ginning.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and context, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but only in terms of context, not in terms of question content or options.

A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example:

Question: How many bees does the biologist have in the terrarium?
Options: A. 50, B. 60, C. 70, D. 100
Correct Option: B

This new MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and correct answer.

**Transcript**:
You’re a biologist on a mission to keep the rare honeybee 
Apis Trifecta from going extinct. The last 60 bees of the species 
are in your terrarium. You’ve already constructed wire frames
of the appropriate size and shape. Now you need to turn 
them into working beehives by helping the bees fill 
every hex with wax. There are two ways to fill a given hex. The first is to place a bee into it. Once placed, a bee cannot 
be removed without killing it. The second: if at any point an unfilled hex has three
or more neighboring wax-filled hexes, the bees already in the hive 
will move in and transform it. Once the bees have transformed 
every hex in a hive, you can place an additional bee inside
and it’ll specialize into a queen. The hive, if well cared for, 
will eventually produce new bees and continue the species. If there are no hexes with three or more 
transformed neighbors, the bees will just sit and wait. And once a bee transforms a hex, 
it can never become a queen. You could put 59 bees in one wire hive,
wait till they transform all the hexes, and then create a queen. But then just one collapse 
would end the species. The more viable hives 
you can make now, the better. So how many can you make with 60 bees? Pause the video to figure
it out yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Answer in 0 What you're looking for here is some 
kind of self-sustaining chain reaction, where a small number of bees 
will transform an entire hive. The lower the number of bees needed,
the better. So how low can we go, 
and how can we engineer a chain reaction? Let’s start with the first question. There's a really clever approach to this, which involves counting the sides 
of the filled-in hexes, and examining their total perimeter. Let’s suppose we put bees 
in these three hexes. The total transformed 
perimeter has 18 sides. But the middle hex 
has three transformed neighbors, so the bees will transform it too. What happens to the perimeter? It’s still 18! And even after the bees transform the next
sets of hexes with three neighbors, it still won’t change. What’s going on here? Each hex that has at least three sides 
touching the bee-friendly space will remove those sides from the perimeter
when it transforms. Then it adds at most three new sides 
to the perimeter. So the perimeter of the transformed hexes
will either stay the same or shrink. The final perimeter 
of the entire hive is 54, so the total perimeter of the hexes 
we place bees in at the start must be at least 54 as well. Dividing that 54 by the six sides 
on each non-adjacent hex tells us it’ll take at least 9 bees 
to transform the entire hive. That’s a great start, but we still have the tough question 
of where the nine bees should go, and if we’ll need more. Let’s think smaller. We already know that three bees could
completely transform a hive this big. What about a slightly bigger one? The perimeter of this hive is 30, which means we’ll need 
at least 5 bees to fill it in. With 6 it’d be easy. Placing them like this would fill out 
the whole hive in just three steps. But we can do better! We don’t actually need to place 
a bee on this hex, since the other bees will transform
that spot on their own. It looks like we have 
the beginning of a pattern. Can we extend it to our full hive? That would mean placing 
our 9 bees like so. Once they get to work, 
they’ll create a chain reaction that fills in the center of the hive 
and extend it to its edges. Add a 10th bee to the completed hive 
and it becomes a queen. Repeat that process five more times and you’ve helped the last 60 members
of Apis trifecta create 6 producing hives. All in all, 
it’s a pretty good bee-ginning.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of hexes a single bee can transform on its own. While there isn't a direct match, Question 3 is related to the transformation of hexes, but it asks about the condition under which bees transform an unfilled hex.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, as it talks about the consequence for a bee that transforms a hex. However, it's still not a direct match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: Question 2.

However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the question content and options of the ground truth MCQ would be more suitable.

**Transcript**:
A few years ago, you founded a company
that manufactures meatless burgers. Your product is now sold 
in stores worldwide. But you’ve recently received awful news: three unrelated people in one city died
after eating your burgers. The police concluded that a criminal 
targeted your brand, injecting poison into your product 
in at least two grocery stores. The culprit used an ultrafine instrument 
that left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine 
which products were compromised. Your burgers were immediately
removed from the two stores where the victims bought them. The deaths are headline news, the killer is still at large, 
and sales have plummeted. You must quickly develop a strategy 
to deal with the crisis. Your team comes up with three options: 1. Do nothing. 2. Pull the products from grocery stores 
citywide and destroy them. Or 3. Pull and destroy 
the product worldwide. Which do you choose? Your company lawyer explains 
that a recall is not required by law because the criminal is fully responsible. She recommends the first option— 
doing nothing— because recalling the product 
could look like an admission of fault. But is that the most ethical strategy? To gauge the ethicality of each choice, you could perform 
a “stakeholder analysis.” This would allow you to weigh 
the interests of some key stakeholders— investors, employees, and customers—
against one another. With the first option your advisors project that the crisis 
will eventually blow over. Sales will then improve but probably 
stay below prior levels because of damage to the brand. As a result, you’ll have to lay off 
some employees, and investors will suffer minor losses. But more customers could die 
if the killer poisoned packages elsewhere. The second option is expensive
in the short-term and will require greater employee layoffs and additional financial loss 
to investors. But this option is safer 
for customers in the city and could create enough trust 
that sales will eventually rebound. The third option is the most expensive 
in the short-term and will require significant 
employee layoffs and investor losses. Though you have no evidence that these
crimes are an international threat, this option provides the greatest
customer protection. Given the conflict between the interests
of your customers versus those of your investors 
and employees, which strategy is the most ethical? To make this decision, 
you could consider these tests: First is the Utilitarian Test: Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned with maximizing the greatest amount 
of good for the greatest number of people. What would be the impact of each
option on these terms? Second is the Family Test: How would you feel
explaining your decision to your family? Third is the Newspaper Test: how would you feel reading about it 
on the front page of the local newspaper? And finally, you could use 
the Mentor Test: If someone you admire were making 
this decision, what would they do? Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke 
faced a similar challenge in 1982 after a criminal added the poison cyanide
to bottles of Tylenol in Chicago. Seven people died and sales dropped. Industry analysts said 
the company was done for. In response, Burke decided to pull Tylenol
from all shelves worldwide, citing customer safety 
as the company’s highest priority. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed
an estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol valued at 250 million in today’s dollars. 1.5 million of the recalled bottles 
were tested and 3 of them— all from the Chicago area— were found to contain cyanide. Burke’s decision helped the company 
regain the trust of its customers, and product sales rebounded within a year. Prompted by the Tylenol murders, 
Johnson & Johnson became a leader in developing tamper-resistant packaging and the government instituted 
stricter regulations. The killer, meanwhile, was never caught. Burke’s decision prevented further deaths
from the initial poisoning, but the federal government investigated
hundreds of copycat tampering incidents involving other products 
in the following weeks. Could these have been prevented 
with a different response? Was Burke acting in the interest 
of the public or of his company? Was this good ethics or good marketing? As with all ethical dilemmas, 
this has no clear right or wrong answer. And for your meatless burger empire,
the choice remains yours.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the difficulty in determining which meatless burger products were tampered with. The closest generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: What was the reason for the deaths of three unrelated people in one city after eating the company's meatless burgers?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the difficulty in determining which products were tampered with, one of its options (B) mentions that "A criminal targeted the brand, injecting poison into the product in at least two grocery stores" and the transcript explains that "The culprit used an ultrafine instrument that left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine which products were compromised." This information is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content, I would suggest creating a new MCQ that directly asks about the difficulty in determining which products were tampered with.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that **none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ**. But if I had to pick one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, although it's not a perfect match.

Index: 1 (Keep in mind that this is not a perfect match)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6 is not the most similar, but Question 8: What is a potential downside of recalling a product in a situation like this? has some relation to the ground truth MCQ. However the most similar is Question 2's Option C.**

However, the most similar generated MCQ is actually **Question 2**, as it is related to the company lawyer's advice, but it does not contain any information about the false statement.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be one that asks about false statements or the outcome of the situation. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

If I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 2** is the most similar, but it would be more accurate to say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, another look at the generated MCQs and I found that **Question 8** has an option that is related to the ground truth MCQ's Option B "The criminal killer was arrested a few years later when he tampered with bottles of Tylenol." 

**Question 8** has an option that says "It may be seen as an admission of fault by the company." which the lawyer mentioned in the passage, and also the passage mentioned "The killer, meanwhile, was never caught." which is the opposite of what Option B of the ground truth MCQ says.

With that in mind, I think **Question 8** is not the most similar but has some relation to the ground truth MCQ.

But **Question 2** and the passage have information that the criminal was not caught and also about the lawyer's advice which is the opposite of what Option B of the ground truth MCQ says.

With that in mind, I think **Question 2** or **8** are not the most similar but have some relation to the ground truth MCQ.

However the passage has information about what happened to the killer "The killer, meanwhile, was never caught." 

And with the generated MCQ **6** that has information about another case, but **Question 7** has the outcome of that case.

But what is more similar is **Question 6** that has information about another case, and the outcome of that case is in **Question 7**, but what is more similar is the **Question 2** that has the opposite information of what the Option B of the ground truth MCQ says.

However I can see that **Question 8** is related to the lawyer's advice but is not the most similar.

But I think I can see a more similar question which is **Question 2**, it does have the opposite information of what Option B of the ground truth MCQ says.

However I think I made a mistake I should choose **Question 6** because the passage has the following information "The killer, meanwhile, was never caught." but it talks about another case.

I think the correct answer is not **Question 6**, but I think I should re-read the passage and the questions again.

After re-reading the passage and the generated MCQs I think the most similar is **Question 2** or **8** but they do not have the exact information, but **Question 2** has the opposite information of what Option B of the ground truth MCQ says.

However **Question 6** has information about another case.

And the outcome of that case is in **Question 7**, but I think the correct answer is **Question 2**, it is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ but does not contain the same information.

However **Question 2** does contain the opposite information of what Option B of the ground truth MCQ says.

But **Question 8** is related to the lawyer's advice.

However I think I should choose **Question 2**.

The correct answer is **2**.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Which option for dealing with the crisis would likely result in the greatest customer protection?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match would be a question that asks about the options considered in response to the burger poisoning.

A more suitable match is not available among the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 4** is the closest match, although it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

If I were to modify Question 4 to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would rephrase it as:

**Question: All of the following are potential options considered in response to the burger poisoning EXCEPT**

Options: A. Do nothing because the criminal, not your company, poisoned the burgers., B. Pull your meatless burger products only from the stores where the poisonings are known to have occurred., C.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A few years ago, you founded a company
that manufactures meatless burgers. Your product is now sold 
in stores worldwide. But you’ve recently received awful news: three unrelated people in one city died
after eating your burgers. The police concluded that a criminal 
targeted your brand, injecting poison into your product 
in at least two grocery stores. The culprit used an ultrafine instrument 
that left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine 
which products were compromised. Your burgers were immediately
removed from the two stores where the victims bought them. The deaths are headline news, the killer is still at large, 
and sales have plummeted. You must quickly develop a strategy 
to deal with the crisis. Your team comes up with three options: 1. Do nothing. 2. Pull the products from grocery stores 
citywide and destroy them. Or 3. Pull and destroy 
the product worldwide. Which do you choose? Your company lawyer explains 
that a recall is not required by law because the criminal is fully responsible. She recommends the first option— 
doing nothing— because recalling the product 
could look like an admission of fault. But is that the most ethical strategy? To gauge the ethicality of each choice, you could perform 
a “stakeholder analysis.” This would allow you to weigh 
the interests of some key stakeholders— investors, employees, and customers—
against one another. With the first option your advisors project that the crisis 
will eventually blow over. Sales will then improve but probably 
stay below prior levels because of damage to the brand. As a result, you’ll have to lay off 
some employees, and investors will suffer minor losses. But more customers could die 
if the killer poisoned packages elsewhere. The second option is expensive
in the short-term and will require greater employee layoffs and additional financial loss 
to investors. But this option is safer 
for customers in the city and could create enough trust 
that sales will eventually rebound. The third option is the most expensive 
in the short-term and will require significant 
employee layoffs and investor losses. Though you have no evidence that these
crimes are an international threat, this option provides the greatest
customer protection. Given the conflict between the interests
of your customers versus those of your investors 
and employees, which strategy is the most ethical? To make this decision, 
you could consider these tests: First is the Utilitarian Test: Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned with maximizing the greatest amount 
of good for the greatest number of people. What would be the impact of each
option on these terms? Second is the Family Test: How would you feel
explaining your decision to your family? Third is the Newspaper Test: how would you feel reading about it 
on the front page of the local newspaper? And finally, you could use 
the Mentor Test: If someone you admire were making 
this decision, what would they do? Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke 
faced a similar challenge in 1982 after a criminal added the poison cyanide
to bottles of Tylenol in Chicago. Seven people died and sales dropped. Industry analysts said 
the company was done for. In response, Burke decided to pull Tylenol
from all shelves worldwide, citing customer safety 
as the company’s highest priority. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed
an estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol valued at 250 million in today’s dollars. 1.5 million of the recalled bottles 
were tested and 3 of them— all from the Chicago area— were found to contain cyanide. Burke’s decision helped the company 
regain the trust of its customers, and product sales rebounded within a year. Prompted by the Tylenol murders, 
Johnson & Johnson became a leader in developing tamper-resistant packaging and the government instituted 
stricter regulations. The killer, meanwhile, was never caught. Burke’s decision prevented further deaths
from the initial poisoning, but the federal government investigated
hundreds of copycat tampering incidents involving other products 
in the following weeks. Could these have been prevented 
with a different response? Was Burke acting in the interest 
of the public or of his company? Was this good ethics or good marketing? As with all ethical dilemmas, 
this has no clear right or wrong answer. And for your meatless burger empire,
the choice remains yours.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: Which option for dealing with the crisis would likely result in the greatest customer protection?**

However, this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the greatest potential disadvantage for a stakeholder.

A closer match is:

**Question 8: What is a potential downside of recalling a product in a situation like this?**

But this question still doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 8 is not the best match but Question 4 has an option C which can have a similar meaning to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ (a "pull products from shelves at all the stores" option for investors), so I will choose Question 4 as the closest match:**

However I must note that the generated MCQs do not contain an exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The average 20 year old knows 
between 27,000 and 52,000 different words. By age 60, that number averages 
between 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words 
last less than a second. So with every word, the brain 
has a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options 
matches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses
the correct word. But how? Speech comprehension is different
from reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language 
comprehension— though spoken word recognition 
has been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability 
to understand speech is the brain’s role 
as a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple 
different things at the same time. Most theories assume 
that each word we know is represented by a separate processing 
unit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming 
speech matching that particular word. In the context of the brain, 
the processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity 
across a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units 
may become active, because with just the beginning 
of a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, 
more and more units register that some vital piece of information 
is missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, 
corresponding to one word. This is called the "recognition point." In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress 
the activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend 
up to about 8 syllables per second. Yet, the goal is not only 
to recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings
at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show 
that even upon hearing a word fragment— like "cap"— listeners will start to register 
multiple possible meanings, like captain or capital,
before the full word emerges. This suggests that every time 
we hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings 
in our minds, and by the recognition point the brain 
has settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves 
more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context 
than in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards 
the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, 
like "bat," or "crane," or in cases of homophones
like "no" or "know." For multilingual people, the language
they are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words
that don’t match the language context. So, what about adding completely 
new words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across 
a new word every few days. But if every word is represented 
as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words 
from overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part 
of the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store 
of words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons
with others words. Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer 
over and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual
acquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words. So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions
of meaning as we chat away. At night, we rest, but our brains 
are busy integrating new knowledge into the word network. When we wake up, this process ensures 
that we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: What role does context play in the process of word recognition?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about what doesn't help us recognize words quickly, and one of the options is "Speaking louder", which is not related to the transcript. However, the transcript does mention that context helps guide the brain towards the intended meaning of a word, which is the correct answer in Question 7.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about what doesn't help us recognize words quickly, with options that include "Speaking louder" or other irrelevant factors. However, since such a question is not present among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The average 20 year old knows 
between 27,000 and 52,000 different words. By age 60, that number averages 
between 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words 
last less than a second. So with every word, the brain 
has a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options 
matches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses
the correct word. But how? Speech comprehension is different
from reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language 
comprehension— though spoken word recognition 
has been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability 
to understand speech is the brain’s role 
as a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple 
different things at the same time. Most theories assume 
that each word we know is represented by a separate processing 
unit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming 
speech matching that particular word. In the context of the brain, 
the processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity 
across a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units 
may become active, because with just the beginning 
of a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, 
more and more units register that some vital piece of information 
is missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, 
corresponding to one word. This is called the "recognition point." In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress 
the activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend 
up to about 8 syllables per second. Yet, the goal is not only 
to recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings
at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show 
that even upon hearing a word fragment— like "cap"— listeners will start to register 
multiple possible meanings, like captain or capital,
before the full word emerges. This suggests that every time 
we hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings 
in our minds, and by the recognition point the brain 
has settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves 
more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context 
than in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards 
the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, 
like "bat," or "crane," or in cases of homophones
like "no" or "know." For multilingual people, the language
they are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words
that don’t match the language context. So, what about adding completely 
new words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across 
a new word every few days. But if every word is represented 
as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words 
from overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part 
of the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store 
of words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons
with others words. Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer 
over and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual
acquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words. So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions
of meaning as we chat away. At night, we rest, but our brains 
are busy integrating new knowledge into the word network. When we wake up, this process ensures 
that we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the frequency at which adults learn new words. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 9 and Question 10 discuss how new words are stored and integrated into the brain.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9 or Question 10. Between these two, Question 10 is more focused on the process of new words being added to the brain over time.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be: 10

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the frequency at which adults learn new words.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1900s on the island of Crete, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
uncovered nearly 3,000 tablets inscribed with strange symbols. He thought these symbols represented
the language spoken by Europe’s oldest civilization. Their meaning would elude scholars 
for 50 years. Evans discovered these tablets 
amid the colorful frescoes and maze-like hallways
of the palace of Knossos. He called the civilization Minoan— after the mythical Cretan ruler, 
King Minos. He thought the script, dubbed Linear B,
represented the Minoan language, and scholars all over the world 
came up with their own theories. Was it the lost language of the Etruscans? Or perhaps it represented 
an early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans
guarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions 
were published during his lifetime–– but he couldn’t decipher the script. However, he did make 
two accurate observations: the tablets were administrative records,
and the script was a syllabary, where each symbol represented 
both a consonant and a vowel, mixed with characters 
that each represented a whole word. Evans worked on Linear B for three decades
before a scholar from Brooklyn, New York, named Alice Kober 
set out to solve the mystery. Kober was a professor 
of Classics at Brooklyn College when few women held such positions. To help in her quest, she taught herself
many languages–– knowledge she knew she would need 
to decipher Linear B. For the next two decades, 
she analyzed the symbols. Working from the few 
available inscriptions, she recorded how often 
each symbol appeared. Then she recorded how frequently 
each symbol appeared next to another. She stored her findings on scrap paper 
in cigarette cartons because writing supplies were scarce 
during the Second World War. By analyzing these frequencies, she discovered that Linear B 
relied on word endings to give its sentences grammar. From this she began to build a chart 
of the relations between the signs, coming closer than anyone before 
to deciphering Linear B. But she died, probably of cancer, 
in 1950 at the age of 43. While Kober was analyzing 
the Knossos tablets, an architect named Michael Ventris 
was also working to crack Linear B. He had become obsessed with Linear B
as a schoolboy after hearing Evans speak. He even worked on deciphering 
the script while serving in World War II. After the war, Ventris 
built on Kober’s grid using a newly published cache 
of Linear B inscriptions excavated from a different archeological
site called Pylos, on mainland Greece. His real breakthrough came 
when he compared the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos and saw that certain words appeared on
tablets from one site but not the other. He wondered if those words represented
the names of places specific to each location. He knew that over centuries, place names
tend to remain constant, and decided to compare Linear B to an ancient syllabary 
from the island of Cyprus. The Cypriot script was used 
hundreds of years after Linear B, but some of the symbols were similar— he wondered if the sounds 
would be similar, too. When Ventris plugged some of the sounds 
of the Cypriot syllabary into the Linear B inscriptions, he came up with the word Knossos, the name of the city where Evans 
had discovered his tablets. In a domino effect, 
Ventris unraveled Linear B, with each word revealing more clearly 
that the language of Linear B was not Minoan, but Greek. Ventris died in a car crash four years 
later, at the age of 34. But his discovery rewrote 
a chapter of history. Evans had insisted that the Minoans 
conquered the mainland Greeks, and that was why examples of Linear B 
were found on the mainland. But the discovery that Linear B 
represented Greek, and not Minoan, showed that the opposite had happened: mainland Greeks invaded Crete and adopted
the Minoan script for their own language. But the story isn’t over yet. The actual language of the Minoans, represented by another script 
called Linear A, has yet to be deciphered. It remains a mystery—
at least for now.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1900s on the island of Crete, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
uncovered nearly 3,000 tablets inscribed with strange symbols. He thought these symbols represented
the language spoken by Europe’s oldest civilization. Their meaning would elude scholars 
for 50 years. Evans discovered these tablets 
amid the colorful frescoes and maze-like hallways
of the palace of Knossos. He called the civilization Minoan— after the mythical Cretan ruler, 
King Minos. He thought the script, dubbed Linear B,
represented the Minoan language, and scholars all over the world 
came up with their own theories. Was it the lost language of the Etruscans? Or perhaps it represented 
an early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans
guarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions 
were published during his lifetime–– but he couldn’t decipher the script. However, he did make 
two accurate observations: the tablets were administrative records,
and the script was a syllabary, where each symbol represented 
both a consonant and a vowel, mixed with characters 
that each represented a whole word. Evans worked on Linear B for three decades
before a scholar from Brooklyn, New York, named Alice Kober 
set out to solve the mystery. Kober was a professor 
of Classics at Brooklyn College when few women held such positions. To help in her quest, she taught herself
many languages–– knowledge she knew she would need 
to decipher Linear B. For the next two decades, 
she analyzed the symbols. Working from the few 
available inscriptions, she recorded how often 
each symbol appeared. Then she recorded how frequently 
each symbol appeared next to another. She stored her findings on scrap paper 
in cigarette cartons because writing supplies were scarce 
during the Second World War. By analyzing these frequencies, she discovered that Linear B 
relied on word endings to give its sentences grammar. From this she began to build a chart 
of the relations between the signs, coming closer than anyone before 
to deciphering Linear B. But she died, probably of cancer, 
in 1950 at the age of 43. While Kober was analyzing 
the Knossos tablets, an architect named Michael Ventris 
was also working to crack Linear B. He had become obsessed with Linear B
as a schoolboy after hearing Evans speak. He even worked on deciphering 
the script while serving in World War II. After the war, Ventris 
built on Kober’s grid using a newly published cache 
of Linear B inscriptions excavated from a different archeological
site called Pylos, on mainland Greece. His real breakthrough came 
when he compared the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos and saw that certain words appeared on
tablets from one site but not the other. He wondered if those words represented
the names of places specific to each location. He knew that over centuries, place names
tend to remain constant, and decided to compare Linear B to an ancient syllabary 
from the island of Cyprus. The Cypriot script was used 
hundreds of years after Linear B, but some of the symbols were similar— he wondered if the sounds 
would be similar, too. When Ventris plugged some of the sounds 
of the Cypriot syllabary into the Linear B inscriptions, he came up with the word Knossos, the name of the city where Evans

**Transcript**:
In the early 1900s on the island of Crete, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
uncovered nearly 3,000 tablets inscribed with strange symbols. He thought these symbols represented
the language spoken by Europe’s oldest civilization. Their meaning would elude scholars 
for 50 years. Evans discovered these tablets 
amid the colorful frescoes and maze-like hallways
of the palace of Knossos. He called the civilization Minoan— after the mythical Cretan ruler, 
King Minos. He thought the script, dubbed Linear B,
represented the Minoan language, and scholars all over the world 
came up with their own theories. Was it the lost language of the Etruscans? Or perhaps it represented 
an early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans
guarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions 
were published during his lifetime–– but he couldn’t decipher the script. However, he did make 
two accurate observations: the tablets were administrative records,
and the script was a syllabary, where each symbol represented 
both a consonant and a vowel, mixed with characters 
that each represented a whole word. Evans worked on Linear B for three decades
before a scholar from Brooklyn, New York, named Alice Kober 
set out to solve the mystery. Kober was a professor 
of Classics at Brooklyn College when few women held such positions. To help in her quest, she taught herself
many languages–– knowledge she knew she would need 
to decipher Linear B. For the next two decades, 
she analyzed the symbols. Working from the few 
available inscriptions, she recorded how often 
each symbol appeared. Then she recorded how frequently 
each symbol appeared next to another. She stored her findings on scrap paper 
in cigarette cartons because writing supplies were scarce 
during the Second World War. By analyzing these frequencies, she discovered that Linear B 
relied on word endings to give its sentences grammar. From this she began to build a chart 
of the relations between the signs, coming closer than anyone before 
to deciphering Linear B. But she died, probably of cancer, 
in 1950 at the age of 43. While Kober was analyzing 
the Knossos tablets, an architect named Michael Ventris 
was also working to crack Linear B. He had become obsessed with Linear B
as a schoolboy after hearing Evans speak. He even worked on deciphering 
the script while serving in World War II. After the war, Ventris 
built on Kober’s grid using a newly published cache 
of Linear B inscriptions excavated from a different archeological
site called Pylos, on mainland Greece. His real breakthrough came 
when he compared the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos and saw that certain words appeared on
tablets from one site but not the other. He wondered if those words represented
the names of places specific to each location. He knew that over centuries, place names
tend to remain constant, and decided to compare Linear B to an ancient syllabary 
from the island of Cyprus. The Cypriot script was used 
hundreds of years after Linear B, but some of the symbols were similar— he wondered if the sounds 
would be similar, too. When Ventris plugged some of the sounds 
of the Cypriot syllabary into the Linear B inscriptions, he came up with the word Knossos, the name of the city where Evans 
had discovered his tablets. In a domino effect, 
Ventris unraveled Linear B, with each word revealing more clearly 
that the language of Linear B was not Minoan, but Greek. Ventris died in a car crash four years 
later, at the age of 34. But his discovery rewrote 
a chapter of history. Evans had insisted that the Minoans 
conquered the mainland Greeks, and that was why examples of Linear B 
were found on the mainland. But the discovery that Linear B 
represented Greek, and not Minoan, showed that the opposite had happened: mainland Greeks invaded Crete and adopted
the Minoan script for their own language. But the story isn’t over yet. The actual language of the Minoans, represented by another script 
called Linear A, has yet to be deciphered. It remains a mystery—
at least for now.

**Transcript**:
In February of 1942, 
Mexican farmer Dionisio Pulido thought he heard thunder 
coming from his cornfield. However, the sound wasn’t coming 
from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack 
emitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as 
the volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava 
and ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered 
its unpredictable eruption? The story of any volcano 
begins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms 
in areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle 
and lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains 
under the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance 
of three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust 
pushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, 
magmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces 
strains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough 
and heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, 
the consequences can be explosive. One of the most common causes 
of an eruption is an increase 
in magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements 
and compounds, many of which are dissolved 
in the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds 
like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form 
high-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force 
of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles 
explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash 
into the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act 
like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers 
the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force 
pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process 
was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes 
for these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma 
from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds 
into the mix. But bubbles can also form 
when magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture
of dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those 
minerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate 
many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration 
of the compounds that form explosive bubbles. Not all eruptions are due 
to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock 
above can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities 
of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure 
and instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible 
for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion 
of Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen 
over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists 
are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change 
could increase volcanic activity. Finally, eruptions can occur when 
the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process 
called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone 
into soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened 
by tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures 
allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust 
can be stretched thin as continental plates 
shift away from each other. Unfortunately, knowing 
what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine 
the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers 
makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly 
exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging 
have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze 
gases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact 
of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better
understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.

**Transcript**:
In February of 1942, 
Mexican farmer Dionisio Pulido thought he heard thunder 
coming from his cornfield. However, the sound wasn’t coming 
from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack 
emitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as 
the volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava 
and ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered 
its unpredictable eruption? The story of any volcano 
begins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms 
in areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle 
and lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains 
under the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance 
of three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust 
pushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, 
magmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces 
strains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough 
and heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, 
the consequences can be explosive. One of the most common causes 
of an eruption is an increase 
in magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements 
and compounds, many of which are dissolved 
in the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds 
like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form 
high-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force 
of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles 
explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash 
into the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act 
like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers 
the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force 
pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process 
was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes 
for these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma 
from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds 
into the mix. But bubbles can also form 
when magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture
of dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those 
minerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate 
many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration 
of the compounds that form explosive bubbles. Not all eruptions are due 
to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock 
above can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities 
of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure 
and instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible 
for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion 
of Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen 
over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists 
are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change 
could increase volcanic activity. Finally, eruptions can occur when 
the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process 
called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone 
into soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened 
by tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures 
allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust 
can be stretched thin as continental plates 
shift away from each other. Unfortunately, knowing 
what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine 
the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers 
makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly 
exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging 
have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze 
gases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact 
of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better
understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.

**Transcript**:
On January 17, 1920, six armed men 
robbed a Chicago freight train. But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits 
had become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands 
of dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended 
consequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production 
and sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels 
of a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure 
during World War I. But the view in the Western world 
of alcohol as a primary cause of social ills 
was much older. It first gained traction 
during the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers 
poured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups
called temperance movements began to appear in the United States 
and parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed 
that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty 
and domestic violence, and set out to convince 
governments of this. While some simply advocated 
moderate drinking, many believed alcohol 
should be banned entirely. These movements drew support 
from broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active 
participants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect
their families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, 
especially Protestants, denounced alcohol 
as leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists 
believed alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers 
to the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, 
white settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting 
these communities— though there were many other 
destructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments
banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations 
and on reservation land. American temperance movements gained
their first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states 
banning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment 
to the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, 
and transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later
under the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban 
personal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity 
to stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, 
breweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups 
rushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market 
in producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side 
with corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election
for Illinois state attorney in support of a particular 
political faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars, 
known as "speakeasies," began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars 
to elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol 
at home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s 
prescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol 
from being consumed, the government required manufacturers
to add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people
were drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol 
wasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition 
had not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political 
corruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, 
the local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great 
Depression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax
revenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition 
would stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st
Amendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol 
was the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely 
didn’t work, the health and social impacts 
of alcohol remain concerns today.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a major country that introduced Prohibition before the United States. The correct answer is Russia.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions the temperance movements in the United States and Europe, but it does not specifically ask about a country that introduced Prohibition before the United States.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not available. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, although it's not a direct match.

Index: 2 (Please note that this is not a direct match, but rather a suggestion based on the available generated MCQs.)

**Transcript**:
On January 17, 1920, six armed men 
robbed a Chicago freight train. But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits 
had become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands 
of dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended 
consequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production 
and sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels 
of a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure 
during World War I. But the view in the Western world 
of alcohol as a primary cause of social ills 
was much older. It first gained traction 
during the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers 
poured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups
called temperance movements began to appear in the United States 
and parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed 
that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty 
and domestic violence, and set out to convince 
governments of this. While some simply advocated 
moderate drinking, many believed alcohol 
should be banned entirely. These movements drew support 
from broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active 
participants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect
their families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, 
especially Protestants, denounced alcohol 
as leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists 
believed alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers 
to the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, 
white settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting 
these communities— though there were many other 
destructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments
banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations 
and on reservation land. American temperance movements gained
their first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states 
banning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment 
to the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, 
and transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later
under the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban 
personal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity 
to stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, 
breweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups 
rushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market 
in producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side 
with corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election
for Illinois state attorney in support of a particular 
political faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars, 
known as "speakeasies," began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars 
to elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol 
at home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s 
prescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol 
from being consumed, the government required manufacturers
to add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people
were drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol 
wasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition 
had not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political 
corruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, 
the local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great 
Depression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax
revenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition 
would stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st
Amendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol 
was the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely 
didn’t work, the health and social impacts 
of alcohol remain concerns today.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match.

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the populations banned from drinking alcohol in the 1800s, it does mention the temperance movements' goal of convincing governments that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind social problems. The transcript mentions that the American and Canadian governments banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations, which is related to the temperance movements' goals.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the provided options match exactly. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of illegal underground bars during Prohibition. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions a raid on a beer hall in Detroit, which is related to the topic of underground drinking establishments.

However, a more relevant question would be one that deals with the effects of Prohibition or the culture surrounding it. In this case, I would suggest Question 6, which deals with how the wealthy responded to the ban on liquor sales, and mentions the stockpiling of liquor. While not directly related to the name of underground bars, it does touch on the topic of how people accessed and consumed liquor during Prohibition.

But if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, as it deals with a specific event related to Prohibition and drinking establishments.

Options: A. To promote moderate drinking and reduce social problems, B. To ban the sale of alcohol to Native populations, C. To convince governments that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind social problems, D. To organize workers 

Although this question does not directly address why women supported anti-alcohol policies, it does relate to the topic of temperance movements, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ. The correct option (C) also touches on the idea that alcohol was seen as a driver of social problems, which is connected to the reason why women supported anti-alcohol policies (because men spent money on alcohol rather than their families).

**Transcript**:
Ragnarok. The fabled end of the world, when giants, monsters, and Norse gods 
battle for the future. The gods were winning handily until 
the great serpent Jörmungandr emerged. It swallowed Valhalla, 
contorted itself across the land, and then merged into one continuous body 
with no head and no tail. As it begins to digest Valhalla, an exhausted Odin explains that he has 
just enough power to strike the creature with one final bolt of lightning. If you magnify his blast 
with your fabled hammer, Mjölnir, it should pierce the massive serpent. You’ll run with super-speed 
along the serpent’s body. When you hold your hammer high, 
Odin will strike it with lightning and split Jörmungandr open at that point. Then, you’ll need to continue 
running along its body until every part of it is destroyed. You can’t run over the same section twice or you’ll fall into the already blasted 
part of the snake. But you can make multiple passes 
through points where the creature intersects its own body. If you leave any portion un-zapped, 
Jörmungandr will magically regenerate, Odin’s last power will be spent, 
and Valhalla will fall forever. What path can you take to destroy 
the serpent? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 2 1 One powerful way to solve problems 
is to simplify. And in this case, we can focus 
our attention on the two things that are important for our path: intersections and the stretches 
of snake between them. Or, as they’re referred 
to in graph theory, nodes and edges. The edges are important 
because they’re what we need to travel. And the nodes matter 
because they connect the edges, and are where we may need to make choices 
as we run from edge to edge. This simplification into nodes 
and edges leaves us with a ubiquitous and important 
mathematical object known as a graph, or network. We just need to figure out how to travel 
what mathematicians call an Eulerian path, which traces every edge exactly once. Instead of looking at the path as a whole,
let’s zoom in on a single node. During some moment in your run, 
you’ll enter that node, and then exit it. That takes care of two edges. If you enter again, 
you’ll need to exit again too, which requires another pair of edges. So every point along your path 
will have edges that come in pairs. One edge in each pair will function 
as entrance; the other as exit. And that means that the number of edges 
coming out of every node must be even. There are just two exceptions: 
the start and end points, where you can exit 
without entering, or vice versa. If we look at the network 
formed by the serpent again, and number how many edges 
emerge from each node, a pattern jumps out that fits 
what we just saw. Every node has an even number 
of edges emerging from it, except two. So one of these must be the start 
of your route, and the other the end. Interestingly enough, any connected 
network that has exactly 2 nodes with an odd number of edges 
will also contain an Eulerian path. The same is true if there are no nodes 
with an odd number of edges— in that case the path starts 
and ends in the same spot. So knowing that, 
let’s return to our full graph. We can begin by taking care 
of this edge here. Now we can zig-zag back and forth 
across the whole snake until we reach the end. And that's just one solution— 
it helps to be systematic, but you’re likely to happen 
upon many others once you know where to begin 
and end your run. You hold your hammer high 
at the opportune moment, and Odin sends the world-saving surge 
of lightning at you. Then you run 
like you’ve never run before. If you can pull this off, surely nothing 
could stop the might of the Norse Gods. And if something like that were out there,
slouching its way towards you… well, that would be a story 
for another day.

**Transcript**:
Ragnarok. The fabled end of the world, when giants, monsters, and Norse gods 
battle for the future. The gods were winning handily until 
the great serpent Jörmungandr emerged. It swallowed Valhalla, 
contorted itself across the land, and then merged into one continuous body 
with no head and no tail. As it begins to digest Valhalla, an exhausted Odin explains that he has 
just enough power to strike the creature with one final bolt of lightning. If you magnify his blast 
with your fabled hammer, Mjölnir, it should pierce the massive serpent. You’ll run with super-speed 
along the serpent’s body. When you hold your hammer high, 
Odin will strike it with lightning and split Jörmungandr open at that point. Then, you’ll need to continue 
running along its body until every part of it is destroyed. You can’t run over the same section twice or you’ll fall into the already blasted 
part of the snake. But you can make multiple passes 
through points where the creature intersects its own body. If you leave any portion un-zapped, 
Jörmungandr will magically regenerate, Odin’s last power will be spent, 
and Valhalla will fall forever. What path can you take to destroy 
the serpent? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 2 1 One powerful way to solve problems 
is to simplify. And in this case, we can focus 
our attention on the two things that are important for our path: intersections and the stretches 
of snake between them. Or, as they’re referred 
to in graph theory, nodes and edges. The edges are important 
because they’re what we need to travel. And the nodes matter 
because they connect the edges, and are where we may need to make choices 
as we run from edge to edge. This simplification into nodes 
and edges leaves us with a ubiquitous and important 
mathematical object known as a graph, or network. We just need to figure out how to travel 
what mathematicians call an Eulerian path, which traces every edge exactly once. Instead of looking at the path as a whole,
let’s zoom in on a single node. During some moment in your run, 
you’ll enter that node, and then exit it. That takes care of two edges. If you enter again, 
you’ll need to exit again too, which requires another pair of edges. So every point along your path 
will have edges that come in pairs. One edge in each pair will function 
as entrance; the other as exit. And that means that the number of edges 
coming out of every node must be even. There are just two exceptions: 
the start and end points, where you can exit 
without entering, or vice versa. If we look at the network 
formed by the serpent again, and number how many edges 
emerge from each node, a pattern jumps out that fits 
what we just saw. Every node has an even number 
of edges emerging from it, except two. So one of these must be the start 
of your route, and the other the end. Interestingly enough, any connected 
network that has exactly 2 nodes with an odd number of edges 
will also contain an Eulerian path. The same is true if there are no nodes 
with an odd number of edges— in that case the path starts 
and ends in the same spot. So knowing that, 
let’s return to our full graph. We can begin by taking care 
of this edge here. Now we can zig-zag back and forth 
across the whole snake until we reach the end. And that's just one solution— 
it helps to be systematic, but you’re likely to happen 
upon many others once you know where to begin 
and end your run. You hold your hammer high 
at the opportune moment, and Odin sends the world-saving surge 
of lightning at you. Then you run 
like you’ve never run before. If you can pull this off, surely nothing 
could stop the might of the Norse Gods. And if something like that were out there,
slouching its way towards you… well, that would be a story 
for another day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about the number of sides of a square, which is a specific characteristic of a shape. Among the generated MCQs, the most similar one is Question 8: "Which of the shapes mentioned in the transcript has all sides of equal length?" However, this question does not directly ask about the number of sides of a square.

A more similar question is Question 10: "How many sides does a rectangle have?" Although it's about a rectangle, not a square, it's closer in terms of question intent and content.

However, considering the question content, options, and overall intent, the most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 9: "Is the statement 'A rectangle is a type of square' true or false?" is not the most similar, but Question 8 is not the most similar either,  It is actually  Question 10 and more specifically Question 3's option that has the number of sides, but the most similar is actually Question 10's analogous question for the rectangle "How many sides does a rectangle have?" has an analogous question for the square which would be  "How many sides does a square have?" which would be the correct analogous question, however since that question is not available the most similar would be Question 10 and also Question 8 which mentions the characteristic (all sides equal) which would also define the number of sides, however the most similar in the context of number of sides would be Question 10 and its analogous for the square.

However the most similar MCQ in terms of (True or False) and the context of number of sides is actually Question 9 and more specifically Question 9's analogous for the square which is actually "Is the statement 'A square has five sides' true or false?" which would be the correct analogous question and is actually the same as the ground truth MCQ, however that question is not available among the options and the most similar in terms of (True or False) is actually Question 9.

Considering all of the above the most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 9.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10 and Question 2. Question 10 is about the number of sides a rectangle has, and Question 2 is about the difference between a square and a rectangle which includes the fact that a rectangle has two shorter sides and four sides in total.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 10 is the most similar because it directly addresses the fact that a rectangle has four sides, which is part of the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s just after sunrise, 
and 16-year-old Mori Banshirô is already hard at work 
practicing drills with his long sword. Banshirô is an ambitious samurai 
in training, and today he must impress 
his teachers more than ever. Today he’ll make his request 
to travel to the capital city of Edo for a year of martial 
and scholarly studies, and he needs their support, 
along with his father’s. The year is 1800 in the castle town 
of Kôchi, capital of the Tosa domain in Japan. The daimyo rules the domain, and about 
1,500 samurai retainers serve him. For 200 years, 
Japan has been at peace, and the samurai, once primarily warriors, 
now play a much wider range of roles— they are also government officials, scholars, teachers, and even masters 
of the tea ceremony or artists. To prepare for these 
diverse responsibilities, young samurai like Banshirô 
study the “twin paths” of literary learning and the martial arts. At 15, he went through the rites 
of adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords. The long sword is for training 
and combat, while the short sword 
has a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, 
or the daimyo. Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai 
Miyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman 
who lived 150 years earlier. But Banshirô doesn’t admire 
his swordsmanship alone. Miyamoto Musashi was also 
a master calligrapher and painter. That’s the real reason 
Banshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too. After finishing his practice at home, 
he bids his father goodbye and walks to school. His father is preparing to accompany 
the daimyo to the capital. The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese 
military government, requires all the regional rulers 
to alternate years between their castle town 
in the home domain and the capital city. The costly treks back and forth 
keep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up 
their own military forces to challenge the shogunate. The daimyo’s wife and children 
live in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages 
to ensure his loyalty. But the practice 
doesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm 
of life in Japan. Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo. This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s 
turn to go, and Banshirô is desperate to go with him; but given that he’s still in training, 
he’ll need permission from both his father and the domain. At school, Banshirô’s first lesson 
is in swordfighting. Under his teacher’s stern eye, 
he pairs up with his classmates and goes through the routines 
he’s been practicing. At the end of the lesson, he reminds the 
instructor of his request to go to Edo. The instructor cracks 
his first smile of the day, and Banshirô feels confident 
he will gain his support. Next, Banshirô practices archery, 
horsemanship, and swimming before his academic courses 
in the afternoon. Courses cover Confucian philosophy, 
morality, and history. When the instructor calls on him, he has 
the response on the tip of his tongue, ensuring another supporter 
for his campaign. By the end of the day, Banshirô 
feels confident that his formal request will be approved, but the greatest 
challenge is still ahead of him: convincing his father. His father believes the martial arts 
are more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention 
his artistic ambitions. Instead, he talks about renowned 
sword instructors he can train with, and teaching certifications he can earn 
to improve his professional prospects back in Kôchi. Then, he makes his final, 
strongest argument: if he goes this time and succeeds, 
his father can retire and send him instead in the future. It’s this last point 
that finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees 
to take him on his tour of duty. In the bustle of the capital city, 
Banshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition 
to become a painter.

and 16-year-old Mori Banshirô is already hard at work 
practicing drills with his long sword. Banshirô is an ambitious samurai 
in training, and today he must impress 
his teachers more than ever. Today he’ll make his request 
to travel to the capital city of Edo for a year of martial 
and scholarly studies, and he needs their support, 
along with his father’s. The year is 1800 in the castle town 
of Kôchi, capital of the Tosa domain in Japan. The daimyo rules the domain, and about 
1,500 samurai retainers serve him. For 200 years, 
Japan has been at peace, and the samurai, once primarily warriors, 
now play a much wider range of roles— they are also government officials, scholars, teachers, and even masters 
of the tea ceremony or artists. To prepare for these 
diverse responsibilities, young samurai like Banshirô 
study the “twin paths” of literary learning and the martial arts. At 15, he went through the rites 
of adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords. The long sword is for training 
and combat, while the short sword 
has a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, 
or the daimyo. Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai 
Miyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman 
who lived 150 years earlier. But Banshirô doesn’t admire 
his swordsmanship alone. Miyamoto Musashi was also 
a master calligrapher and painter. That’s the real reason 
Banshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too. After finishing his practice at home, 
he bids his father goodbye and walks to school. His father is preparing to accompany 
the daimyo to the capital. The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese 
military government, requires all the regional rulers 
to alternate years between their castle town 
in the home domain and the capital city. The costly treks back and forth 
keep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up 
their own military forces to challenge the shogunate. The daimyo’s wife and children 
live in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages 
to ensure his loyalty. But the practice 
doesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm 
of life in Japan. Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo. This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s 
turn to go, and Banshirô is desperate to go with him; but given that he’s still in training, 
he’ll need permission from both his father and the domain. At school, Banshirô’s first lesson 
is in swordfighting. Under his teacher’s stern eye, 
he pairs up with his classmates and goes through the routines 
he’s been practicing. At the end of the lesson, he reminds the 
instructor of his request to go to Edo. The instructor cracks 
his first smile of the day, and Banshirô feels confident 
he will gain his support. Next, Banshirô practices archery, 
horsemanship, and swimming before his academic courses 
in the afternoon. Courses cover Confucian philosophy, 
morality, and history. When the instructor calls on him, he has 
the response on the tip of his tongue, ensuring another supporter 
for his campaign. By the end of the day, Banshirô 
feels confident that his formal request will be approved, but the greatest 
challenge is still ahead of him: convincing his father. His father believes the martial arts 
are more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention 
his artistic ambitions. Instead, he talks about renowned 
sword instructors he can train with, and teaching certifications he can earn 
to improve his professional prospects back in Kôchi. Then, he makes his final, 
strongest argument: if he goes this time and succeeds, 
his father can retire and send him instead in the future. It’s this last point 
that finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees 
to take him on his tour of duty. In the bustle of the capital city, 
Banshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition 
to become a painter.

I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah. Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea. These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years. Now, orcas are also
known as killer whales. They're profoundly social
and profoundly intelligent beings. And scientists are very interested
in their behavior, because in their social networks,
they share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean. But this pod has been in trouble. The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor
has been way down in the region, and pollution has been up. But on July 24th, Tahlequah
gave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited
by this development. But unfortunately, the same day --
in fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died. Well, what happened next
electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused
to let her baby slip off into the water. She kept it on her body
and she swam with it. If it did fall off,
she would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this. Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time,
she swam over 1,000 miles. At that point, she let the little baby
slip off into the water. So today, Tahlequah
swims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me. And I do believe that "grief"
is the right word to use. I believe that grief
is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Because these visible cues,
these behavioral cues, tell us something about
an animal's emotional state. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document
examples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals
and in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality
of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge
to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the "a-word." The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically,
it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So, anthropomorphism is when
we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions. And we can all probably
think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, "My cat understands everything I say." Or, "My dog, he's so sweet. he ran right across the yard this morning
towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play." Well, maybe. Or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different, because we're not trying
to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them
with some meaning. Now, it's true -- scientists
often push back at me, and they'll say, "Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine
has been disrupted." But I think that this overworry
about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point. And that is that animals
can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other. And when they do, a survivor's heart
can be pierced by a death. Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out
on embracing part of ourselves. So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world
a better place for animals, a kinder place for animals. So let me tell you a little bit more
about animal grief. I'm going to start in Kenya. You see here there's
an elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed. You see on the left that another female named Grace
came to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet. And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again. At this point, Grace became
visibly distressed, and she prodded the body,
and she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die. What you see on the right is a female
from another family named Maui, who came after the death,
and she stayed at the body. She held a vigil there,
and she even rocked in distress over the body. So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days. And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families. Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe
should be classified as grief. So what does grief look like? It can be rocking, as I said, in distress. It can also be social withdrawal, when an animal just takes
himself or herself away from friends and stays by themselves, or a failure to eat or sleep properly, sometimes a depressed posture
or vocalization. It can be very helpful
for those of us studying this to be able to compare the behavior
of a survivor before death and after death, because that increases the rigor
of our interpretation. And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks
named Harper and Kohl. So we're into birds now. So Harper and Kohl were raised
at a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly. Foie gras does involve
force-feeding of birds. So this hurt their bodies, and their
spirits were not in good shape, either. But thankfully, they were rescued
by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends. They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper
to the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there
for over an hour with his friend. And in the weeks after, he had a hard time. He would go back to that same pond
where he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends. And within two months, he died as well. Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals
have this sorrowful outcome. Last summer, I flew to Boston
to visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie. I really needed a break from work. But I succumbed,
and I checked my work email. You know how that is. And there was a communication
about a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist,
this wasn't what I expected, but there it was, and I'm glad I read it. Because a donkey named Lena
had gone to another farm sanctuary, this one in Alberta, Canada, as the only donkey there, and had trouble making friends
for that reason. But she eventually did make friends
with an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable. But the reason the email came
was that Jake, at age 32, the horse, had become gravely ill
and had to be put down, and this is what was going on. This is Lena standing on Jake's grave. She didn't want to come in at night.
She didn't want to come in for food. She didn't want to come in for water. She pawed at the grave,
she brayed in distress, and there she stood. So we talked and we brainstormed. What do you do for an animal like this? And we talked about the role of time, of extra love and kindness from people and of urging her to make a new friend. And here's where her trajectory does
diverge from that of Harper the duck, because she did make a new friend, and sanctuary workers wrote back
and said it worked out well. Now sometimes, scientists
supplement observation with hormonal analysis. There's an example of a group
of scientists in Botswana, who took fecal material from baboons
and compared two different groups. The first group were females
who had witnessed a predator attack and lost someone in that attack, and the second group were females
who had witnessed an attack but had not lost someone. And the stress hormones
were way up in that first group. But here's the thing: the scientists didn't just
call them "stressed baboons," they called them "bereaved baboons," and in part, that's because
of the observations that they made. For example, this mother-daughter
pair were very close, and then the daughter
was killed by a lion. The mother removed herself
from all her friends, from her grooming networks,
and just stayed by herself for weeks -- bereavement -- and she then slowly recovered. So we have bereaved baboons. Will science tell us someday
about bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason
is because animals really need one-to-one, close relationships
for that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters,
and personality matters. I have documented
cats and dogs who grieve, our companion animals, but I also interacted with a woman
who was extremely bothered because her dog wasn't grieving. She said to me, "The first dog
in the house has died. The second animal does not
seem concerned, the second dog. What is wrong with him?" (Laughter) And as I listened to her, I realized that this dog was now
the only animal in the household, and as far as he was concerned,
that was a pretty good deal. So circumstances matter. Now, in any case, animals
are not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people
we've never met, across space and time. I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean
that their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing, and we can see it if we choose. Now, I've lost both my parents. I lost a very dear friend
at a young age from AIDS. I believe most likely most of you
here have lost someone. And I have found it a genuine comfort, a solace, to know that we aren't
the only beings on this earth who feel love and grief. And I think this is important. I also think we can take
this a step further, and we can realize
that the reality of animal grief can help us be better
and do better for animals. This is already happening with Tahlequah, because the United States and Canada have
renewed their talks with greater urgency for how to help the orcas, how to restore the Chinook salmon and how to help with the water pollution. We can also see that if grief is real, there's tremendous
plausibility to the notion that animals feel a whole range of things. So we could look at joy,
sadness, even hope. And if we do that, here's how we can start
to think about the world. We can look at orcas and say, we know they grieve,
we know they feel their lives, and we can refuse to confine them
to small tanks in theme parks and make them perform
for our entertainment. (Applause) Thank you. We can look at elephants
and say, yes, they grieve, and we can renew our efforts
against international trophy hunting and against poaching. (Applause) Thank you. And we can look at our closest
living relatives, monkeys and apes, and know yes they grieve,
they feel their lives, so they don't deserve to be confined in highly invasive biomedical experiments year after year. And, you know -- (Applause) the ducks Harper and Kohl,
they tell us something too. They help us connect the dots
and realize that what we eat affects how animals live. And it's not just foie gras,
and it's not just ducks. We can think about pigs and chickens
and cows in factory farms, and we can know. I can tell you the science is real
that these animals feel, too. So every single time
we choose a plant-based meal, we are contributing
to reducing animal suffering. (Applause) So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief. I believe in the reality of animal love, and I think it is time for us humans to recognize that
we don't own these things. And when we see that, we have an opportunity to make the world
so much better for animals, a kinder world, a gentler world, and along the way, we might
just save ourselves, too. Thank you so much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah. Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea. These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years. Now, orcas are also
known as killer whales. They're profoundly social
and profoundly intelligent beings. And scientists are very interested
in their behavior, because in their social networks,
they share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean. But this pod has been in trouble. The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor
has been way down in the region, and pollution has been up. But on July 24th, Tahlequah
gave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited
by this development. But unfortunately, the same day --
in fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died. Well, what happened next
electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused
to let her baby slip off into the water. She kept it on her body
and she swam with it. If it did fall off,
she would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this. Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time,
she swam over 1,000 miles. At that point, she let the little baby
slip off into the water. So today, Tahlequah
swims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me. And I do believe that "grief"
is the right word to use. I believe that grief
is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Because these visible cues,
these behavioral cues, tell us something about
an animal's emotional state. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document
examples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals
and in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality
of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge
to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the "a-word." The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically,
it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So, anthropomorphism is when
we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions. And we can all probably
think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, "My cat understands everything I say." Or, "My dog, he's so sweet. he ran right across the yard this morning
towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play." Well, maybe. Or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different, because we're not trying
to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them
with some meaning. Now, it's true -- scientists
often push back at me, and they'll say, "Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine
has been disrupted." But I think that this overworry
about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point. And that is that animals
can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other. And when they do, a survivor's heart
can be pierced by a death. Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out
on embracing part of ourselves. So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world
a better place for animals, a kinder place for animals. So let me tell you a little bit more
about animal grief. I'm going to start in Kenya. You see here there's
an elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed. You see on the left that another female named Grace
came to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet. And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again. At this point, Grace became
visibly distressed, and she prodded the body,
and she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die. What you see on the right is a female
from another family named Maui, who came after the death,
and she stayed at the body. She held a vigil there,
and she even rocked in distress over the body. So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days. And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families. Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe
should be classified as grief. So what does grief look like? It can be rocking, as I said, in distress. It can also be social withdrawal, when an animal just takes
himself or herself away from friends and stays by themselves, or a failure to eat or sleep properly, sometimes a depressed posture
or vocalization. It can be very helpful
for those of us studying this to be able to compare the behavior
of a survivor before death and after death, because that increases the rigor
of our interpretation. And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks
named Harper and Kohl. So we're into birds now. So Harper and Kohl were raised
at a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly. Foie gras does involve
force-feeding of birds. So this hurt their bodies, and their
spirits were not in good shape, either. But thankfully, they were rescued
by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends. They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper
to the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there

by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends. They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper
to the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there
for over an hour with his friend. And in the weeks after, he had a hard time. He would go back to that same pond
where he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends. And within two months, he died as well. Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals
have this sorrowful outcome. Last summer, I flew to Boston
to visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie. I really needed a break from work. But I succumbed,
and I checked my work email. You know how that is. And there was a communication
about a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist,
this wasn't what I expected, but there it was, and I'm glad I read it. Because a donkey named Lena
had gone to another farm sanctuary, this one in Alberta, Canada, as the only donkey there, and had trouble making friends
for that reason. But she eventually did make friends
with an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable. But the reason the email came
was that Jake, at age 32, the horse, had become gravely ill
and had to be put down, and this is what was going on. This is Lena standing on Jake's grave. She didn't want to come in at night.
She didn't want to come in for food. She didn't want to come in for water. She pawed at the grave,
she brayed in distress, and there she stood. So we talked and we brainstormed. What do you do for an animal like this? And we talked about the role of time, of extra love and kindness from people and of urging her to make a new friend. And here's where her trajectory does
diverge from that of Harper the duck, because she did make a new friend, and sanctuary workers wrote back
and said it worked out well. Now sometimes, scientists
supplement observation with hormonal analysis. There's an example of a group
of scientists in Botswana, who took fecal material from baboons
and compared two different groups. The first group were females
who had witnessed a predator attack and lost someone in that attack, and the second group were females
who had witnessed an attack but had not lost someone. And the stress hormones
were way up in that first group. But here's the thing: the scientists didn't just
call them "stressed baboons," they called them "bereaved baboons," and in part, that's because
of the observations that they made. For example, this mother-daughter
pair were very close, and then the daughter
was killed by a lion. The mother removed herself
from all her friends, from her grooming networks,
and just stayed by herself for weeks -- bereavement -- and she then slowly recovered. So we have bereaved baboons. Will science tell us someday
about bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason
is because animals really need one-to-one, close relationships
for that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters,
and personality matters. I have documented
cats and dogs who grieve, our companion animals, but I also interacted with a woman
who was extremely bothered because her dog wasn't grieving. She said to me, "The first dog
in the house has died. The second animal does not
seem concerned, the second dog. What is wrong with him?" (Laughter) And as I listened to her, I realized that this dog was now
the only animal in the household, and as far as he was concerned,
that was a pretty good deal. So circumstances matter. Now, in any case, animals
are not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people
we've never met, across space and time. I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean
that their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing, and we can see it if we choose. Now, I've lost both my parents. I lost a very dear friend
at a young age from AIDS. I believe most likely most of you
here have lost someone. And I have found it a genuine comfort, a solace, to know that we aren't
the only beings on this earth who feel love and grief. And I think this is important. I also think we can take
this a step further, and we can realize
that the reality of animal grief can help us be better
and do better for animals. This is already happening with Tahlequah, because the United States and Canada have
renewed their talks with greater urgency for how to help the orcas, how to restore the Chinook salmon and how to help with the water pollution. We can also see that if grief is real, there's tremendous
plausibility to the notion that animals feel a whole range of things. So we could look at joy,
sadness, even hope. And if we do that, here's how we can start
to think about the world. We can look at orcas and say, we know they grieve,
we know they feel their lives, and we can refuse to confine them
to small tanks in theme parks and make them perform
for our entertainment. (Applause) Thank you. We can look at elephants
and say, yes, they grieve, and we can renew our efforts
against international trophy hunting and against poaching. (Applause) Thank you. And we can look at our closest
living relatives, monkeys and apes, and know yes they grieve,
they feel their lives, so they don't deserve to be confined in highly invasive biomedical experiments year after year. And, you know -- (Applause) the ducks Harper and Kohl,
they tell us something too. They help us connect the dots
and realize that what we eat affects how animals live. And it's not just foie gras,
and it's not just ducks. We can think about pigs and chickens
and cows in factory farms, and we can know. I can tell you the science is real
that these animals feel, too. So every single time
we choose a plant-based meal, we are contributing
to reducing animal suffering. (Applause) So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief. I believe in the reality of animal love, and I think it is time for us humans to recognize that
we don't own these things. And when we see that, we have an opportunity to make the world
so much better for animals, a kinder world, a gentler world, and along the way, we might
just save ourselves, too. Thank you so much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah. Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea. These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years. Now, orcas are also
known as killer whales. They're profoundly social
and profoundly intelligent beings. And scientists are very interested
in their behavior, because in their social networks,
they share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean. But this pod has been in trouble. The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor
has been way down in the region, and pollution has been up. But on July 24th, Tahlequah
gave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited
by this development. But unfortunately, the same day --
in fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died. Well, what happened next
electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused
to let her baby slip off into the water. She kept it on her body
and she swam with it. If it did fall off,
she would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this. Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time,
she swam over 1,000 miles. At that point, she let the little baby
slip off into the water. So today, Tahlequah
swims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me. And I do believe that "grief"
is the right word to use. I believe that grief
is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Because these visible cues,
these behavioral cues, tell us something about
an animal's emotional state. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document
examples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals
and in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality
of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge
to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the "a-word." The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically,
it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So, anthropomorphism is when
we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions. And we can all probably
think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, "My cat understands everything I say." Or, "My dog, he's so sweet. he ran right across the yard this morning
towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play." Well, maybe. Or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different, because we're not trying
to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them
with some meaning. Now, it's true -- scientists
often push back at me, and they'll say, "Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine
has been disrupted." But I think that this overworry
about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point. And that is that animals
can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other. And when they do, a survivor's heart
can be pierced by a death. Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out
on embracing part of ourselves. So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world
a better place for animals, a kinder place for animals. So let me tell you a little bit more
about animal grief. I'm going to start in Kenya. You see here there's
an elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed. You see on the left that another female named Grace
came to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet. And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again. At this point, Grace became
visibly distressed, and she prodded the body,
and she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die. What you see on the right is a female
from another family named Maui, who came after the death,
and she stayed at the body. She held a vigil there,
and she even rocked in distress over the body. So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days. And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families. Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe
should be classified as grief. So what does grief look like? It can be rocking, as I said, in distress. It can also be social withdrawal, when an animal just takes
himself or herself away from friends and stays by themselves, or a failure to eat or sleep properly, sometimes a depressed posture
or vocalization. It can be very helpful
for those of us studying this to be able to compare the behavior
of a survivor before death and after death, because that increases the rigor
of our interpretation. And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks
named Harper and Kohl. So we're into birds now. So Harper and Kohl were raised
at a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly. Foie gras does involve
force-feeding of birds. So this hurt their bodies, and their
spirits were not in good shape, either. But thankfully, they were rescued
by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends. They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper
to the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there
for over an hour with his friend. And in the weeks after, he had a hard time. He would go back to that same pond
where he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends. And within two months, he died as well. Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals
have this sorrowful outcome. Last summer, I flew to Boston
to visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie. I really needed a break from work. But I succumbed,
and I checked my work email. You know how that is. And there was a communication
about a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist,

for that reason. But she eventually did make friends
with an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable. But the reason the email came

**Transcript**:
Today, plastics are everywhere. All of this plastic originated 
from one small object— that isn’t even made of plastic. For centuries, billiard balls were 
made of ivory from elephant tusks. But when excessive hunting caused
elephant populations to decline in the 19th century, billiard balls makers began to look 
for alternatives, offering huge rewards. So in 1863 an American named 
John Wesley Hyatt took up the challenge. Over the next five years, he invented 
a new material called celluloid, made from cellulose, a compound found
in wood and straw. Hyatt soon discovered celluloid couldn’t
solve the billiard ball problem–– the material wasn’t heavy enough 
and didn’t bounce quite right. But it could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive
materials like coral, tortoiseshell, amber, and mother-of-pearl. He had created what became
known as the first plastic. The word ‘plastic’ can describe 
any material made of polymers, which are just the large molecules
consisting of the same repeating subunit. This includes all human-made plastics, as well as many of the materials
found in living things. But in general, when people refer 
to plastics, they’re referring to synthetic materials. The unifying feature of these 
is that they start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape. Despite taking the prize 
as the first official plastic, celluloid was highly flammable,
which made production risky. So inventors began to hunt
for alternatives. In 1907 a chemist combined phenol— a waste product of coal tar— and formaldehyde, creating 
a hardy new polymer called bakelite. Bakelite was much less flammable 
than celluloid and the raw materials used to make it were
more readily available. Bakelite was only the beginning. In the 1920s, researchers first
commercially developed polystyrene, a spongy plastic used in insulation. Soon after came polyvinyl chloride,
or vinyl, which was flexible yet hardy. Acrylics created transparent, shatter-proof panels 
that mimicked glass. And in the 1930s nylon took centre stage— a polymer designed to mimic silk, 
but with many times its strength. Starting in 1933, polyethylene became
one of the most versatile plastics, still used today to make everything 
from grocery bags, to shampoo bottles, to bulletproof vests. New manufacturing technologies 
accompanied this explosion of materials. The invention of a technique 
called injection-moulding made it possible to insert melted plastics
into molds of any shape, where they would rapidly harden. This created possibilities for products
in new varieties and shapes— and a way to inexpensively and rapidly 
produce plastics at scale. Scientists hoped this economical 
new material would make items that once had been
unaffordable accessible to more people. Instead, plastics were pushed into service
in World War Two. During the war, plastic production 
in the United States quadrupled. Soldiers wore new plastic helmet liners 
and water-resistant vinyl raincoats. Pilots sat in cockpits made of plexiglass,
a shatterproof plastic, and relied on parachutes 
made of resilient nylon. Afterwards, plastic manufacturing 
companies that had sprung up during wartime turned
their attention to consumer products. Plastics began to replace other materials
like wood, glass, and fabric in furniture, clothing, shoes,
televisions, and radios. Versatile plastics opened up possibilities
for packaging— mainly designed to keep food 
and other products fresh for longer. Suddenly, there were plastic garbage bags,
stretchy plastic wrap, squeezable plastic bottles, 
takeaway cartons, and plastic containers for fruit,
vegetables, and meat. Within just a few decades, 
this multifaceted material ushered in what became known as
the “plastics century.” While the plastics century brought 
convenience and cost-effectiveness, it also created staggering 
environmental problems. Many plastics are made of nonrenewable
resources. And plastic packaging was designed
to be single-use, but some plastics take centuries 
to decompose, creating a huge build up of waste. This century we’ll have to concentrate our
innovations on addressing those problems— by reducing plastic use,
developing biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways 
to recycle existing plastic.

**Transcript**:
Today, plastics are everywhere. All of this plastic originated 
from one small object— that isn’t even made of plastic. For centuries, billiard balls were 
made of ivory from elephant tusks. But when excessive hunting caused
elephant populations to decline in the 19th century, billiard balls makers began to look 
for alternatives, offering huge rewards. So in 1863 an American named 
John Wesley Hyatt took up the challenge. Over the next five years, he invented 
a new material called celluloid, made from cellulose, a compound found
in wood and straw. Hyatt soon discovered celluloid couldn’t
solve the billiard ball problem–– the material wasn’t heavy enough 
and didn’t bounce quite right. But it could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive
materials like coral, tortoiseshell, amber, and mother-of-pearl. He had created what became
known as the first plastic. The word ‘plastic’ can describe 
any material made of polymers, which are just the large molecules
consisting of the same repeating subunit. This includes all human-made plastics, as well as many of the materials
found in living things. But in general, when people refer 
to plastics, they’re referring to synthetic materials. The unifying feature of these 
is that they start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape. Despite taking the prize 
as the first official plastic, celluloid was highly flammable,
which made production risky. So inventors began to hunt
for alternatives. In 1907 a chemist combined phenol— a waste product of coal tar— and formaldehyde, creating 
a hardy new polymer called bakelite. Bakelite was much less flammable 
than celluloid and the raw materials used to make it were
more readily available. Bakelite was only the beginning. In the 1920s, researchers first
commercially developed polystyrene, a spongy plastic used in insulation. Soon after came polyvinyl chloride,
or vinyl, which was flexible yet hardy. Acrylics created transparent, shatter-proof panels 
that mimicked glass. And in the 1930s nylon took centre stage— a polymer designed to mimic silk, 
but with many times its strength. Starting in 1933, polyethylene became
one of the most versatile plastics, still used today to make everything 
from grocery bags, to shampoo bottles, to bulletproof vests. New manufacturing technologies 
accompanied this explosion of materials. The invention of a technique 
called injection-moulding made it possible to insert melted plastics
into molds of any shape, where they would rapidly harden. This created possibilities for products
in new varieties and shapes— and a way to inexpensively and rapidly 
produce plastics at scale. Scientists hoped this economical 
new material would make items that once had been
unaffordable accessible to more people. Instead, plastics were pushed into service
in World War Two. During the war, plastic production 
in the United States quadrupled. Soldiers wore new plastic helmet liners 
and water-resistant vinyl raincoats. Pilots sat in cockpits made of plexiglass,
a shatterproof plastic, and relied on parachutes 
made of resilient nylon. Afterwards, plastic manufacturing 
companies that had sprung up during wartime turned
their attention to consumer products. Plastics began to replace other materials
like wood, glass, and fabric in furniture, clothing, shoes,
televisions, and radios. Versatile plastics opened up possibilities
for packaging— mainly designed to keep food 
and other products fresh for longer. Suddenly, there were plastic garbage bags,
stretchy plastic wrap, squeezable plastic bottles, 
takeaway cartons, and plastic containers for fruit,
vegetables, and meat. Within just a few decades, 
this multifaceted material ushered in what became known as
the “plastics century.” While the plastics century brought 
convenience and cost-effectiveness, it also created staggering 
environmental problems. Many plastics are made of nonrenewable
resources. And plastic packaging was designed
to be single-use, but some plastics take centuries 
to decompose, creating a huge build up of waste. This century we’ll have to concentrate our
innovations on addressing those problems— by reducing plastic use,
developing biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways 
to recycle existing plastic.

An albatross delivered your invitation,
you’ve acquired your wand, ridden the enchanted zeppelin, 
made some fast friends, and are finally ready for the adventure
you’ve dreamed of your entire life: your first day at Magnificent Marigold’s
Magical Macademy. But before you can learn your first spell you must get through the most
nerve-wracking moment of the year: the sorting ceremony. When you put on the sorting hat, 
you hear a voice. “Ah, you’re an interesting one. Every year I choose one student 
for a special challenge, and I choose you. The Magical Macademy had 8 founders, and they established our four houses 
two by two by two by two. I alone know which witches founded which. But there was once 
a mysterious fifth house, lost to time but full of secrets
and powerful artifacts. MMMMMM? If you can tell me who founded each house,
I’ll sort you into whichever you want. However, if you can also tell me 
the name of the secret 5th house, I’ll let you sort into it, and you’ll inherit 
everything you discover. “The two founders of each house 
wore different colored hats with non-matching symbols. No founder started more than one house. Of Funflame and Imaginez, 
one was a founder of Gianteye and the other of Longmous. And of Miraculo and Rimbleby, one established Longmous
and the other Meramaid. Finally, Septimus didn’t found Vidopnir.” So… who founded what,
and what’s the name of the secret house? Pause the video now to
figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The hardest part of solving this logic
puzzle is knowing where to start. No rule by itself is enough to assign 
a founder to his or her house, so the next best thing would be to combine a pair of rules
to learn something. 4 and 5 are good candidates 
to try that with, because they contain a lot of constraints
and both mention Longmous. Miraculo and Rimbleby’s hats 
both have moons, which means that no matter 
who ends up in Longmous, moons will be accounted for. That means Imaginez, who also has moons,
can’t have founded Longmous, so she’s in Gianteye and Funflame
founded Longmous. Miraculo’s hat is red, 
so he can’t be there, so he must be in Meramaid 
and Rimbleby in Longmous. Halfway there! Now we can place Septimus–– rule 6 keeps him out of Vidopnir, 
and his yellow hat out of Gianteye, so he must be in Meramaid. Of the founders left, 
Deepmire and Hypnotum both have stars. So each must go into a different house, taking up the remaining space in Gianteye
and leaving one spot open in Vidopnir, which Tremenda must fill. Tremenda’s blue hat keeps 
Deepmire out of Vidopnir, so we can easily place 
her and, finally, Hypnotum. Now that those founders are sorted, we can start to search 
for the secret house. If you don’t have it yet, 
here are a few hints: Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out yourself! One good strategy for a puzzle like this is to look for patterns 
or unusual pieces of information. First of all, there’s the school’s
obsession with the letter M, right down to its motto, which translates
from Latin to “M is a magic letter.” Curiously, every founder 
has exactly one M in their name, and each M is in a different position. That means that the M’s can
put them in order, 1 through 8. We know we needed to solve the logic 
puzzle before finding the secret house, so there must be something critical about the connection between the founders
and their houses. Here’s where a pattern emerges: 
every founder and house have exactly the same number of letters. This allows the founders to line up 
with their houses quite nicely. The first letters don’t spell anything, but let’s look at the M’s in the names
again and the letters they line up with: M, I, N, O, T, A, U, R. You shout out “MINOTAUR” to a stunned
dining hall, and a secret passage grinds open. The wonders of house Minotaur 
are yours if you want them. But being the first and only resident 
of the secret house would come at a high price: loneliness. So which will it be: riches or friendship?

and his yellow hat out of Gianteye, so he must be in Meramaid. Of the founders left, 
Deepmire and Hypnotum both have stars. So each must go into a different house, taking up the remaining space in Gianteye
and leaving one spot open in Vidopnir, which Tremenda must fill. Tremenda’s blue hat keeps 
Deepmire out of Vidopnir, so we can easily place 
her and, finally, Hypnotum. Now that those founders are sorted, we can start to search 
for the secret house. If you don’t have it yet, 
here are a few hints: Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out yourself! One good strategy for a puzzle like this is to look for patterns 
or unusual pieces of information. First of all, there’s the school’s
obsession with the letter M, right down to its motto, which translates
from Latin to “M is a magic letter.” Curiously, every founder 
has exactly one M in their name, and each M is in a different position. That means that the M’s can
put them in order, 1 through 8. We know we needed to solve the logic 
puzzle before finding the secret house, so there must be something critical about the connection between the founders
and their houses. Here’s where a pattern emerges: 
every founder and house have exactly the same number of letters. This allows the founders to line up 
with their houses quite nicely. The first letters don’t spell anything, but let’s look at the M’s in the names
again and the letters they line up with: M, I, N, O, T, A, U, R. You shout out “MINOTAUR” to a stunned
dining hall, and a secret passage grinds open. The wonders of house Minotaur 
are yours if you want them. But being the first and only resident 
of the secret house would come at a high price: loneliness. So which will it be: riches or friendship?

**Transcript**:
This pond is the only home 
this fish has ever known. But lately, it’s gotten crowded 
and food is scarce. Luckily, it has an option many don’t: as a walking catfish, it can dance 
its way out of the water and onto bigger and better things. However, it faces many challenges 
on its terrestrial journey: it’s now in danger of suffocating, 
drying up, suffering physical damage 
from rough terrain, and being hunted by land predators. We think of fish 
as completely aquatic animals. But the walking catfish is just one 
of hundreds of fish species that are actually amphibious, meaning that they possess adaptations 
that enable them to survive on land. Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum. At one end are species 
like the mosquitofish that’ll only move on land when forced. And at the other end 
are species like mudskippers that nonchalantly hop around mudflats 
for days at a time. But why do fish make the exodus 
from water to land? And how do they cope 
with this drastic transition? If temperatures get too high 
for the mangrove rivulus in the shallow tropical pools 
it inhabits, it’ll flip itself onto a bank 
and cool off in the shade. During the dry period, it can survive for two months 
out of the water by staying in moist environments. Meanwhile, the eel catfish 
makes its onshore voyage to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles. And for others, the terrestrial draw 
is more ritualistic. Every year under the cover of night, masses of California grunion flop 
their way onto sandy beaches, where females deposit thousands of eggs 
into the sand before re-entering the ocean. Underwater, fish breathe with gills, which are feathery organs 
packed with blood vessels that absorb dissolved oxygen 
from the water. But in the open air, their gills collapse 
and are rendered useless, so amphibious fishes need 
other ways to breathe. The armored catfish’s stomach 
is packed with blood vessels, so it can gulp down air 
and breathe through its stomach lining. And lungfish, being related 
to the ancestors of all tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates, 
are equipped with true lungs. They’ll actually drown 
if they’re kept underwater too long. Fish have thin, permeable skin 
that allows for essential compounds to diffuse into and out of their bodies 
while they’re underwater. But this works against them on land 
as their bodily moisture diffuses into the air. To dodge dehydration, mudskippers 
roll in the mud like puppies. But the lungfish takes the cake: the rivers it inhabits disappear 
during dry seasons, so it buries itself in the earth
and coats its body in a mucus cocoon. It can survive like this for years 
until being resuscitated by the next big rainstorm. Amphibious fishes use powerful fins 
to move on land and clever tools to navigate as they go. The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, 
no bigger than a few centimeters, scales hundred-meter-tall 
Hawaiian waterfalls, inching its way up by alternately 
attaching the suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins. To find water while on land, 
the mummichog, like most amphibious fishes, 
is on the lookout for reflective surfaces. Other species, like mosquitofish, exercise their inner ear to determine 
where they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll 
find water by moving downhill. Our walking catfish, meanwhile, uses the taste buds that coat 
its body for navigation. These taste buds are concentrated 
in its whiskers, which whip through the air, sensing compounds that signal 
the proximity and quality of nearby water— and prey. The walking catfish will shimmy towards 
attractive volatile amino acids while steering clear of foul waters 
emanating hydrogen sulfide. While amphibious fishes face a multitude 
of new challenges upon leaving the water, they’ve evolved ingenious ways 
to overcome them. They’re resilient in the face 
of droughts and floods and have access to new prey 
as well as a plan B if they need to escape competitive, 
polluted, or unhealthy environments. While being a “fish out of water” 
is generally regarded as a bad thing, for these species, 
it offers an undisputed edge.

**Transcript**:
This pond is the only home 
this fish has ever known. But lately, it’s gotten crowded 
and food is scarce. Luckily, it has an option many don’t: as a walking catfish, it can dance 
its way out of the water and onto bigger and better things. However, it faces many challenges 
on its terrestrial journey: it’s now in danger of suffocating, 
drying up, suffering physical damage 
from rough terrain, and being hunted by land predators. We think of fish 
as completely aquatic animals. But the walking catfish is just one 
of hundreds of fish species that are actually amphibious, meaning that they possess adaptations 
that enable them to survive on land. Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum. At one end are species 
like the mosquitofish that’ll only move on land when forced. And at the other end 
are species like mudskippers that nonchalantly hop around mudflats 
for days at a time. But why do fish make the exodus 
from water to land? And how do they cope 
with this drastic transition? If temperatures get too high 
for the mangrove rivulus in the shallow tropical pools 
it inhabits, it’ll flip itself onto a bank 
and cool off in the shade. During the dry period, it can survive for two months 
out of the water by staying in moist environments. Meanwhile, the eel catfish 
makes its onshore voyage to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles. And for others, the terrestrial draw 
is more ritualistic. Every year under the cover of night, masses of California grunion flop 
their way onto sandy beaches, where females deposit thousands of eggs 
into the sand before re-entering the ocean. Underwater, fish breathe with gills, which are feathery organs 
packed with blood vessels that absorb dissolved oxygen 
from the water. But in the open air, their gills collapse 
and are rendered useless, so amphibious fishes need 
other ways to breathe. The armored catfish’s stomach 
is packed with blood vessels, so it can gulp down air 
and breathe through its stomach lining. And lungfish, being related 
to the ancestors of all tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates, 
are equipped with true lungs. They’ll actually drown 
if they’re kept underwater too long. Fish have thin, permeable skin 
that allows for essential compounds to diffuse into and out of their bodies 
while they’re underwater. But this works against them on land 
as their bodily moisture diffuses into the air. To dodge dehydration, mudskippers 
roll in the mud like puppies. But the lungfish takes the cake: the rivers it inhabits disappear 
during dry seasons, so it buries itself in the earth
and coats its body in a mucus cocoon. It can survive like this for years 
until being resuscitated by the next big rainstorm. Amphibious fishes use powerful fins 
to move on land and clever tools to navigate as they go. The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, 
no bigger than a few centimeters, scales hundred-meter-tall 
Hawaiian waterfalls, inching its way up by alternately 
attaching the suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins. To find water while on land, 
the mummichog, like most amphibious fishes, 
is on the lookout for reflective surfaces. Other species, like mosquitofish, exercise their inner ear to determine 
where they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll 
find water by moving downhill. Our walking catfish, meanwhile, uses the taste buds that coat 
its body for navigation. These taste buds are concentrated 
in its whiskers, which whip through the air, sensing compounds that signal 
the proximity and quality of nearby water— and prey. The walking catfish will shimmy towards 
attractive volatile amino acids while steering clear of foul waters 
emanating hydrogen sulfide. While amphibious fishes face a multitude 
of new challenges upon leaving the water, they’ve evolved ingenious ways 
to overcome them. They’re resilient in the face 
of droughts and floods and have access to new prey 
as well as a plan B if they need to escape competitive, 
polluted, or unhealthy environments. While being a “fish out of water” 
is generally regarded as a bad thing, for these species, 
it offers an undisputed edge.

**Transcript**:
Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,
Crispy and Chewy, are out strolling 
when they’re caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, 
he decides that, instead of simply eating them, he’ll put their friendship 
to the test with a cruel dilemma. He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether
he’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know what the other
chose until their decisions are locked in. If both choose to spare the other, the fox
will eat just one of each of their limbs; if one chooses to spare 
while the other sacrifices, the sparer will be fully eaten, while the traitor will run away
with all his limbs intact. Finally, if both choose to sacrifice,
the fox will eat 3 limbs from each. In game theory, this scenario 
is called the “Prisoner's Dilemma.” To figure out how these gingerbread men 
will act in their perfect rationality, we can map the outcomes of each decision. The rows represent Crispy’s choices,
and the columns are Chewy’s. Meanwhile, the numbers in each cell represent the outcomes 
of their decisions, as measured in the number 
of limbs each would keep: So do we expect their friendship 
to last the game? First, let’s consider Chewy’s options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run
away scot-free by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy sacrifices him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs
if he also sacrifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome
by choosing to sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. This is the standard conclusion
of the Prisoner's Dilemma: the two characters will
betray one another. Their strategy to unconditionally
sacrifice their companion is what game theorists
call the “Nash Equilibrium," meaning that neither can gain
by deviating from it. Crispy and Chewy act accordingly and the smug fox runs off 
with a belly full of gingerbread, leaving the two former friends
with just one leg to stand on. Normally, this is where
the story would end, but a wizard happened to be watching
the whole mess unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy that, 
as punishment for betraying each other, they’re doomed to repeat this dilemma
for the rest of their lives, starting with all four limbs
at each sunrise. Now what happens? This is called an Infinite Prisoner’s 
Dilemma, and it’s a literal game changer. That’s because the gingerbread men 
can now use their future decisions as bargaining chips for the present ones. Consider this strategy: both agree 
to spare each other every day. If one ever chooses to sacrifice, the other will retaliate by choosing 
“sacrifice” for the rest of eternity. So is that enough to get these
poor sentient baked goods to agree to cooperate? To figure that out, we have to factor
in another consideration: the gingerbread men probably care
about the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future
limbs by some number, which we’ll call delta. This is similar to the idea of inflation 
eroding the value of money. If delta is one half, on day one they care about day 2 limbs
half as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs 1 quarter as much 
as day 1 limbs, and so on. A delta of 0 means that they don’t care 
about their future limbs at all, so they’ll repeat their initial choice
of mutual sacrifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, 
they’ll do anything possible to avoid the pain of infinite triple limb 
consumption, which means they’ll choose
to spare each other. At some point in between
they could go either way. We can find out where that point is by writing the infinite series 
that represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other,
and solving for delta. That yields 1/3, meaning that as long
as Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at least 1/3 as much as today, it’s optimal for them 
to spare and cooperate forever. This analysis isn’t unique
to cookies and wizards; we see it play out in real-life situations like trade negotiations
and international politics. Rational leaders must assume 
that the decisions they make today will impact those of their adversaries 
tomorrow. Selfishness may win out in the short-term,
but with the proper incentives, peaceful cooperation is not only possible,
but demonstrably and mathematically ideal. As for the gingerbread men, 
their eternity may be pretty crumby, but so long as they go out on a limb, their friendship will never 
again be half-baked.

**Transcript**:
Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,
Crispy and Chewy, are out strolling 
when they’re caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, 
he decides that, instead of simply eating them, he’ll put their friendship 
to the test with a cruel dilemma. He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether
he’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know what the other
chose until their decisions are locked in. If both choose to spare the other, the fox
will eat just one of each of their limbs; if one chooses to spare 
while the other sacrifices, the sparer will be fully eaten, while the traitor will run away
with all his limbs intact. Finally, if both choose to sacrifice,
the fox will eat 3 limbs from each. In game theory, this scenario 
is called the “Prisoner's Dilemma.” To figure out how these gingerbread men 
will act in their perfect rationality, we can map the outcomes of each decision. The rows represent Crispy’s choices,
and the columns are Chewy’s. Meanwhile, the numbers in each cell represent the outcomes 
of their decisions, as measured in the number 
of limbs each would keep: So do we expect their friendship 
to last the game? First, let’s consider Chewy’s options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run
away scot-free by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy sacrifices him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs
if he also sacrifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome
by choosing to sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. This is the standard conclusion
of the Prisoner's Dilemma: the two characters will
betray one another. Their strategy to unconditionally
sacrifice their companion is what game theorists
call the “Nash Equilibrium," meaning that neither can gain
by deviating from it. Crispy and Chewy act accordingly and the smug fox runs off 
with a belly full of gingerbread, leaving the two former friends
with just one leg to stand on. Normally, this is where
the story would end, but a wizard happened to be watching
the whole mess unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy that, 
as punishment for betraying each other, they’re doomed to repeat this dilemma
for the rest of their lives, starting with all four limbs
at each sunrise. Now what happens? This is called an Infinite Prisoner’s 
Dilemma, and it’s a literal game changer. That’s because the gingerbread men 
can now use their future decisions as bargaining chips for the present ones. Consider this strategy: both agree 
to spare each other every day. If one ever chooses to sacrifice, the other will retaliate by choosing 
“sacrifice” for the rest of eternity. So is that enough to get these
poor sentient baked goods to agree to cooperate? To figure that out, we have to factor
in another consideration: the gingerbread men probably care
about the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future
limbs by some number, which we’ll call delta. This is similar to the idea of inflation 
eroding the value of money. If delta is one half, on day one they care about day 2 limbs
half as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs 1 quarter as much 
as day 1 limbs, and so on. A delta of 0 means that they don’t care 
about their future limbs at all, so they’ll repeat their initial choice
of mutual sacrifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, 
they’ll do anything possible to avoid the pain of infinite triple limb 
consumption, which means they’ll choose
to spare each other. At some point in between
they could go either way. We can find out where that point is by writing the infinite series 
that represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other,
and solving for delta. That yields 1/3, meaning that as long
as Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at least 1/3 as much as today, it’s optimal for them 
to spare and cooperate forever. This analysis isn’t unique
to cookies and wizards; we see it play out in real-life situations like trade negotiations
and international politics. Rational leaders must assume 
that the decisions they make today will impact those of their adversaries 
tomorrow. Selfishness may win out in the short-term,
but with the proper incentives, peaceful cooperation is not only possible,
but demonstrably and mathematically ideal. As for the gingerbread men, 
their eternity may be pretty crumby, but so long as they go out on a limb, their friendship will never 
again be half-baked.

**Transcript**:
In the 1980s, a bonobo named Kanzi learned to communicate with humans
to an unprecedented extent— not through speech or gestures, but using a keyboard of abstract symbols
representing objects and actions. By pointing to several of these in order,
he created sequences to make requests, answer verbal questions 
from human researchers, and refer to objects 
that weren’t physically present. Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate 
controversy over one question: had Kanzi learned language? What we call language is something 
more specific than communication. Language is about sharing 
what’s in our minds: stories, opinions, questions, 
the past or future, imagined times or places, ideas. It is fundamentally open-ended, and can be used to say 
an unlimited number of things. Many researchers are convinced 
that only humans have language, that the calls and gestures other species
use to communicate are not language. Each of these calls and gestures generally
corresponds to a specific message, for a limited total number of messages that aren’t combined 
into more complex ideas. For example, a monkey species 
might have a specific warning call that corresponds to a particular predator,
like a snake— but with language, there are countless 
ways to say “watch out for the snake.” So far no animal communication seems 
to have the open-endedness of human language. We don’t know for sure what’s going
on in animals’ heads, and it's possible this definition 
of language, or our ways of measuring it,
don’t apply to them. But as far as we know, 
only humans have language. And while humans speak 
around 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language, indicating that the biological machinery
underlying language is common to all of us. So what does language mean for humanity? What does it allow us to do, 
and how did we come to have it? Exactly when we acquired this capacity
is still an open question. Chimps and bonobos 
are our closest living relatives, but the lineage leading to humans 
split from the other great apes more than four million years ago. In between, there were many species—
all of them now extinct, which makes it very difficult to know
if they had language or anything like it. Great apes give one potential clue 
to the origins of language, though: it may have started as gesture 
rather than speech. Great apes gesture to each other 
in the wild much more freely than they vocalize. Language may have begun to take shape
during the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago, 
with the emergence of the genus Homo that eventually gave rise 
to our own species, homo sapiens. Brain size tripled, and bipedalism 
freed the hands for communication. There may have been a transition 
from gestural communication to gestural language— from pointing to objects 
and pantomiming actions— to more efficient, abstract signing. The abstraction of gestural communication
would have removed the need for visuals, setting the stage for a transition 
to spoken language. That transition would have 
likely come later, though. Articulate speech depends 
on a vocal tract of a particular shape. Even our closest ancestors, 
the Neanderthals and Denisovans, had vocal tracts that were not optimal, though they likely had 
some vocal capacity, and possibly even language. Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal. Spoken words free the hands for activities
such as tool use and transport. So it may have been 
the emergence of speech, not of language itself, that led 
to the dominance of our species. Language is so intimately tied to complex
thought, perception, and motor functions that it’s difficult to untangle
its biological origins. Some of the biggest mysteries remain: to what extent did language 
as a capacity shape humanity, and to what extent did humanity 
shape language? What came first, the vast number 
of possible scenarios we can envisage, or our ability to share them?

to an unprecedented extent— not through speech or gestures, but using a keyboard of abstract symbols
representing objects and actions. By pointing to several of these in order,
he created sequences to make requests, answer verbal questions 
from human researchers, and refer to objects 
that weren’t physically present. Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate 
controversy over one question: had Kanzi learned language? What we call language is something 
more specific than communication. Language is about sharing 
what’s in our minds: stories, opinions, questions, 
the past or future, imagined times or places, ideas. It is fundamentally open-ended, and can be used to say 
an unlimited number of things. Many researchers are convinced 
that only humans have language, that the calls and gestures other species
use to communicate are not language. Each of these calls and gestures generally
corresponds to a specific message, for a limited total number of messages that aren’t combined 
into more complex ideas. For example, a monkey species 
might have a specific warning call that corresponds to a particular predator,
like a snake— but with language, there are countless 
ways to say “watch out for the snake.” So far no animal communication seems 
to have the open-endedness of human language. We don’t know for sure what’s going
on in animals’ heads, and it's possible this definition 
of language, or our ways of measuring it,
don’t apply to them. But as far as we know, 
only humans have language. And while humans speak 
around 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language, indicating that the biological machinery
underlying language is common to all of us. So what does language mean for humanity? What does it allow us to do, 
and how did we come to have it? Exactly when we acquired this capacity
is still an open question. Chimps and bonobos 
are our closest living relatives, but the lineage leading to humans 
split from the other great apes more than four million years ago. In between, there were many species—
all of them now extinct, which makes it very difficult to know
if they had language or anything like it. Great apes give one potential clue 
to the origins of language, though: it may have started as gesture 
rather than speech. Great apes gesture to each other 
in the wild much more freely than they vocalize. Language may have begun to take shape
during the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago, 
with the emergence of the genus Homo that eventually gave rise 
to our own species, homo sapiens. Brain size tripled, and bipedalism 
freed the hands for communication. There may have been a transition 
from gestural communication to gestural language— from pointing to objects 
and pantomiming actions— to more efficient, abstract signing. The abstraction of gestural communication
would have removed the need for visuals, setting the stage for a transition 
to spoken language. That transition would have 
likely come later, though. Articulate speech depends 
on a vocal tract of a particular shape. Even our closest ancestors, 
the Neanderthals and Denisovans, had vocal tracts that were not optimal, though they likely had 
some vocal capacity, and possibly even language. Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal. Spoken words free the hands for activities
such as tool use and transport. So it may have been 
the emergence of speech, not of language itself, that led 
to the dominance of our species. Language is so intimately tied to complex
thought, perception, and motor functions that it’s difficult to untangle
its biological origins. Some of the biggest mysteries remain: to what extent did language 
as a capacity shape humanity, and to what extent did humanity 
shape language? What came first, the vast number 
of possible scenarios we can envisage, or our ability to share them?

Transcriber: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Camille Martínez Hi. You might have noticed
that I have half a beard. It's not because I lost a bet. Many years ago, I was badly burned. Most of my body is covered with scars, including the right side of my face. I just don't have hair.
That's just how it happened. It looks symmetrical, but almost. Anyway, now that we discussed facial hair, let's move to social science. And in particular, I want us to think
about where is the potential for humanity and where we are now. And if you think about it,
there's a big gap between where we think we could be
and where we are, and it's in all kinds of areas. So let me ask you: How many of you in the last month
have eaten more than you think you should? Just kind of general. OK. How many of you in the last month have
exercised less than you think you should? OK, and for how many of you
has raising your hands twice been the most exercise you got today? (Laughter) How many of you have ever
texted while driving? OK, we're getting honest.
Let's test your honesty. How many people here in the last month have not always washed your hands
when you left the bathroom? (Laughter) A little less honest. By the way, it's interesting how we're
willing to admit texting and driving but not washing our hands,
that's difficult. (Laughter) We can go on and on. The problem, the topic is
that there's lots of things when we know what we could do -- we could be very, very different,
but we're acting in a very different way. And when we think
how do we bridge that gap, the usual answer is, "Just tell people." For example, just tell people
that texting and driving is dangerous. Did you know it's dangerous?
You should stop doing it. You tell people something
is dangerous, and they will stop. Texting and driving is one example. Another very sad example
is that in the US, we spend between seven
and eight hundred million dollars a year on what's called "financial literacy." And what do we get
as a consequence of that? There was recently a study that looked
at all the research ever to be conducted on financial literacy --
what's called a meta-analysis. And what they found is that
when you tell people, you teach them financial literacy, they learn and they remember. But do people execute? Not so much. The improvement is about
three or four percent immediately after the course, and then it goes down. And at the end of the day, the improvement is about 0.1 percent -- not zero, but as humanly close
to zero as possible. (Laughter) So that's the sad news. The sad news is, giving
information to people is just not a good recipe
to change behavior. What is? Well, social science
has made lots of strides, and the basic insight is that
if we want to change behavior, we have to change the environment. The right way is not to change people,
it's to change the environment. And I want to present a very simpleminded
model of how to think about it: it's to think about behavioral change in the same way that we think about
sending a rocket to space. When we think about
sending a rocket to space, we want to do two main things. The first one is to reduce friction. We want to take the rocket
and have as little friction as possible so it's the most aerodynamic possible. And the second thing is we want
to load as much fuel as possible, to give it the most amount
of motivation, energy to do its task. And behavior change is the same thing. So let's first talk about friction. In this particular case study
I'll tell you about, there's a pharmacy, an online pharmacy. Imagine you go to your doctor. You have a long-term illness, your doctor prescribes
to you a medication, you sign up for this online pharmacy and you get your medication
in the mail every 90 days. Every 90 days, medication,
medication, medication. And this online pharmacy
wants to switch people from branded medication
to generic medication. So they send people letters, and they say, "Please, please, please,
switch to generics. You will save money, we will save money,
your employer will save money." And what do people do? Nothing. So they try all kinds of things
and nothing happens. So for one year, they give people
an amazing offer. They send people a letter, and they say, "If you switch to generics now,
it will be free for a whole year." Free for a whole year. Amazing! What percentage of people
do you think switched? Less than 10 percent. At this point, they show up to my office. And they come to complain. Why did they pick me? I wrote a couple of papers
on the "allure of free." In those papers, we showed
that if you reduce the price of something for, let's say, 10 cents to one cent,
nothing much happens. You reduce it from one cent to zero,
now people get excited. (Laughter) And they said, "Look, we read these
papers on 'free,' we gave 'free.' Not working as we expected. What's going on?" I said, "You know, maybe
it's a question of friction." They said, "What do you mean?" I said, "People are starting with branded. They can do nothing and end with branded. To move to generic, they have to choose
generic over branded, but they also have to do something. They have to return the letter." So this is what we call
a "confounded design." Two things are happening at the same time. It's branded versus generic, but it's doing nothing
versus doing something. So I said, "Why don't we switch it? Why don't we send people a letter
and say, 'We're switching you to generics. You don't need to do anything. If you want to stay with branded,
please return the letter.'" (Laughter) Right? What do you think happened? Lawyers, lawyers happened. (Laughter) It turns out, this is illegal. (Laughter) By the way, for brainstorming
and creativity, doing things that are illegal
and immoral, it's fine, as long as it's just
in the brainstorming phase. (Laughter) But this was the purity of the idea, because the initial design was
the branded had the no-action benefit. In my illegal, immoral design,
generic had the no-action benefit. But they agreed to give people
a T-intersection: send people a letter and say, "If you don't return this letter, we will be forced
to stop your medications. But when you return the letter,
you could choose branded at this price, generic at this price." Now people had to take an action. They were on even footing. Right? It wasn't that one had
the no-action benefit. What percentage do you think switched? The vast majority switched. So what does it tell us? Do people like generics,
or do we like branded? We hate returning letters. (Laughter) This is the story of friction:
small things really matter. And friction is about taking
the desired behavior and saying: Where do we have
too much friction so it's slowing people down
from acting on it? And every time you see
that the desired behavior and the easy behavior are not aligned, it means we want to try and realign them. That's the first part.
We talked about friction. Now let's talk about motivation. In this particular study, we were trying to get very poor people
in a slum called Kibera in Kenya to save a little bit of money
for a rainy day. You know, if you're very, very poor,
you have no extra money, you live hand to mouth, and from time to time, bad things happen. And when something bad happens,
you have nothing to draw on, you borrow. The Kibera people can borrow at sometimes
up to 10 percent interest a week. And then, of course,
it's really hard to get out of it. You live hand to mouth,
something bad happens, you borrow, things get worse
and worse and worse. So we wanted people to keep
a little bit of money for a rainy day. And we thought about
what is the motivation, what is the fuel that we need to add? And we tried all kinds of things. Some people, we texted them
once a week and said, "Please try to save 100 shillings" --
about a dollar -- "this week." Some people, we sent a text message
as if it came from their kids. So it said, "Hi Mom, hi Dad,
this is little Joey" -- whatever the name of the kid was -- "Try and save 100 shillings this week
for the future of our family." Right? I'm Jewish, a little bit
of guilt always works. (Laughter) Some people got 10 percent. "Save up to a hundred shillings,
we'll give you 10 percent." Some people got 20 percent. Some people got also
10 percent and 20 percent, but they got it with loss aversion. What is loss aversion? Loss aversion is the idea
that we hate losing more than we enjoy gaining. Now, think about somebody
who is in a 10-percent condition and they put 40 shillings in. They put 40 shillings,
we give them four more, they say thank you very much. That person gave up six. They could have gotten six more
if they gave a hundred, but they don't see it. So we created what we call pre-match. We put the 10 shillings in
at the beginning of the week. We said, "It's waiting for you!" And then if somebody puts 40 in,
we say, "Oh, you put 40 in, we're leaving four,
and we're taking six back." So in both cases, pre-match or post-match, people get 10 percent. But in the pre-match, they see the money they did not match
leaving their account. So we have text, text from kids,
10 percent, 20 percent, pre-match, post-match. And we had one more condition. It was a coin about this size, with 24 numbers written on it. And we asked them to put the coin
somewhere in their hut, and every week, take a knife
and scratch the number for that week -- week one, two, three, four -- scratch it like a minus
if they didn't save and scratch it up and down if they saved. Now, think to yourself: Which one of those methods
do you think worked the best? Text, text from the kids,
10 percent, 20 percent, beginning of the week,
end of the week, and the coin? I'll tell you what
the average people think. We've done these studies of prediction, both in the US and in Kenya. People think that 20 percent
will get a lot of action, 10 percent less, the rest of it will do nothing -- kids, coin, doesn't matter. People think loss aversion
will have a small effect. What actually happened? Sending a text reminder once a week helps a lot. Good news! This program lasted six months.
People forget. Reminding people is great. Ten percent at the end
of the week helped some more. Financial incentives work. Twenty percent at the end of the week --
just like 10 percent, no difference. Ten percent in the beginning of the week helps some more. Loss aversion works. Twenty percent in
the beginning of the week, just like 10 percent in the beginning
of the week, no difference. And the text message from the kids
was just as effective as 20 percent plus loss aversion -- which is amazing, right? It's amazing how motivating
messages from kids were. And one conclusion is
we don't use kids enough. (Laughter) And, of course, I don't mean
in a child labor sense. But if you think about
parents and their kids, we are the best that we can for our kids, and we think about the future, and I think we should think about how to use that amazing
source of motivation to get parents to behave in a better way. But the big surprise
of this study was the coin. The coin basically doubled savings
compared to everything else. And now the question is: Why?
What was it about the coin? So I'll tell you how I started
thinking about the coin, and then we'll come back to it. So you know, when I do research
on, let's say, buying coffee, I don't need to go anywhere.
I can sit in my office. I've bought enough coffee.
I know how it works. The details, I'm familiar with. When you do research in some
of the poorest places in the world, you have to go and visit
and see what's going on and get some insight
about how the system works. And on that particular day, I'm in a place called Soweto
in South Africa, and I'm sitting in a place
that sells funeral insurance. You know, in the US people spend
crazy amounts of money on weddings? In South Africa, it's funerals. People spend up to a year
or two years of income on funerals. And I sit in this place -- by the way, before you judge the South
Africans as being irrational with this, I just want to remind you that spending a lot of money
on funerals compared to weddings, at least you know for sure
you only have one. (Laughter) OK, so I sit in this place
that sells funeral insurance. And this guy comes in with his son --
his son is about 12 -- and he buys funeral insurance for a week. It will cover 90 percent
of his funeral expense only if he dies in the next seven days. Right? These are very poor people,
they buy small amounts of insurance and small amount of soap and such. And he gets that certificate, and in a very ceremonious way,
he gives it to his son. And as he gives it to his son,
I think to myself, why the ceremony? What is this father doing? Now, think about the breadwinner
that decides on that particular day to direct some money
into insurance or savings. What is the family going to see tonight? They're going to see less. Right? At that level of poverty, there'll
be less food, less kerosene, less water -- something less tonight. And what his father was doing
and what our coin was trying to do is to say, yes, there's less
food on the table, but there's another activity. You see, what happened is, there are
many good, important economic activities, like savings and insurance,
that are invisible. And now the question is:
How do we make them visible? So let's go back to our rocket model. We have to, first of all,
look at the system and see where there's little things
we can fix, with friction, where is there
that we can remove friction? And then the next thing we want to do
is to think broadly about the system, and say: What other motivations
can we bring in? And that's a much more difficult exercise, and we don't always know
what would work best. Is it going to be money?
Is it going to be loss aversion? Is it going to be
something that is visible? We don't know, and we have
to try different things. We also have to realize that
our intuition sometimes misleads us. We don't always necessarily know
what would work the best. So if we think about this gap between where we could be
and where we are, it's a really sad thing to see this gap
and to think about it. But the good news is,
there's lots we can do. Some of the changes are easy,
some of the changes are more complex. But if we'll attack each problem directly, not by just providing
more information to people but trying to change the friction, add motivation, I think we can ... Can we close the gap? No. But can we get much better?
Absolutely, yes. Thank you very much. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the savannahs of Kenya, two female 
northern white rhinos, Nájin and Fatu, munch contentedly on the grass. At the time of this video’s publication, these are the last two known 
northern white rhinos left on Earth. Their species is functionally extinct— without a male, 
Nájin and Fatu can’t reproduce. And yet, there’s still hope to revive 
the northern white rhino. How can that be? The story starts about 50 years ago, when poachers began illegally hunting 
thousands of rhinos across Africa for their horns. This, combined with civil wars 
in their territory, decimated northern white rhino 
populations. Concerned conservationists began trying 
to breed them in captivity in the 1970s, collecting and storing semen from males. Only four rhinos were ultimately born 
through the ambitious breeding program. Nájin, and her daughter Fatu 
were the last two. In 2014, conservationists discovered 
that neither can have a calf. Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu, 
she now has weak hindlegs, which could harm her health 
if she became pregnant again. Fatu, meanwhile, 
has a degenerated uterine lining. Then, the last northern white rhino male 
of the species, Sudan, died in 2018. But there was one glimmer of hope: 
artificial reproduction. With no living males and no females 
able to carry a pregnancy, this is a complicated and risky process 
to say the least. Though scientists had stored semen, 
they would have to collect the eggs— a complex procedure that requires a female
to be sedated for up to two hours. Then, they’d create a viable embryo 
in the lab— something that had never been done before,
and no one knew how to do. Even that was just the beginning— a surrogate mother 
of another rhino species would have to carry the embryo to term. Females of a closely related species, 
the southern white rhino, became both the key to developing 
a rhino embryo in a lab and the leading candidates 
for surrogate mothers. Northern and southern white rhinos 
diverged about a million of years ago into separate— though still 
closely-related— species. They inhabit different regions, and have 
slightly different physical traits. In a fortunate coincidence, 
several female southern white rhinos needed treatment 
for their own reproductive problems, and researchers could collect eggs 
as part of that treatment. In Dvůr Králové Zoo in October 2015, experts of IZW Berlin began collecting 
eggs from southern white rhinos and sending them to Avantea, an animal 
reproduction laboratory in Italy. There, scientists developed and perfected 
a technique to create a viable embryo. Once they mastered the technique, researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’s 
eggs on August 22, 2019 and flew them to Italy. Three days later, they fertilized 
the eggs with sperm from a northern white rhino male. After another week, two of the eggs 
made it to the stage of development when the embryo can be frozen 
and preserved for future. Another collection in December 2019 
produced one more embryo. As of early 2020, the plan is to collect 
Nájin and Fatu’s eggs three times a year if they’re healthy enough. In the meantime, 
researchers are looking for promising southern white rhino 
surrogate mothers— ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy 
to term before. The surrogacy plan 
is somewhat of a leap of faith— southern and northern white rhinos 
have interbred both during the last glacial period 
and more recently in 1977, so researchers are optimistic 
a southern white rhino would be able to carry 
a northern white rhino to term. Also, the two species’ pregnancies 
are the same length. Still, transferring an embryo 
to a rhino is tricky because of the shape of the cervix. The ultimate goal, 
which will take decades, is to establish a breeding population 
of northern white rhinos in their original range. Studies suggest that we have samples 
from enough individuals to recreate a population with the genetic 
diversity the species had a century ago. Though the specifics 
of this effort are unique, as more species face critical endangerment
or functional extinction, it’s also an arena for big questions: do we have a responsibility to try 
to bring species back from the brink, especially when human actions 
brought them there in the first place? Are there limits to the effort 
we should expend on saving animals threatened 
with extinction?

singlehandedly— all for the sake of a single bull. The army in question belonged 
to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession
of a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture 
the fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Unfortunately, the King of Ulster 
had chosen this moment to force the goddess Macha to race 
her chariot while pregnant. In retaliation, she struck down him 
and his entire army with stomach cramps that eerily resembled childbirth—
all except Cú Chulainn. Though he was the best warrior in Ulster, Cú Chulainn knew he could not take on
Queen Meadhbh’s whole army at once. He invoked the sacred rite 
of single combat in order to fight 
the intruders one by one. But as Queen Meadhbh’s army 
approached, one thing worried him 
more than the grueling ordeal ahead. Years before, Cú Chulainn had travelled 
to Scotland to train with the renowned 
warrior Scáthach. There, he met a young warrior 
from Connaught named Ferdiad. They lived and trained side-by-side,
and soon became close friends. When they returned 
to their respective homes, Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad found themselves 
on opposite sides of a war. Cú Chulainn knew Ferdiad 
was marching in Meadhbh’s army, and that if he succeeded 
in fending off her troops, they would eventually meet. Day after day, Cú Chulainn 
defended Ulster alone. He sent the heads of some 
of his adversaries back to Meadhbh’s camp, while the rushing waters of the ford 
carried others away. At times, he slipped into a trance 
and slayed hundreds of soldiers in a row. Whenever he saw the queen in the distance,
he hurled stones at her— never quite hitting her, but once coming close enough 
to knock a squirrel off her shoulder. Back at the Connaught camp, 
Ferdiad was laying low, doing everything he could 
to avoid the moment when he’d have to face
his best friend in combat. But the Queen was impatient 
to get her hands on the prize bull, and she knew Ferdiad was 
her best chance to defeat Cú Chulainn. So she goaded him 
and questioned his honor until he had no choice but to fight. The two faced off at the ford, matching 
each other exactly in strength and skill no matter what weapons they used. Then, on the third day of their fight,
Ferdiad began to gain the upper hand over the exhausted Cu Chulainn. But Cú Chulainn had one last trick 
up his sleeve: their teacher had shared 
a secret with him alone. She told him how 
to summon the Gáe Bulg, a magical spear fashioned 
from the bones of sea monsters that lay at the bottom of the ocean. Cu Chulainn called the spear, 
stabbed Ferdiad to death, and collapsed. Meadhbh seized her chance 
and swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering
from their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadhbh
crossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown bull with her. Once home, Meadhbh 
demanded another battle, this time between the brown bull 
and her husband’s white bull. The bulls were well matched, 
and struggled into the night, dragging each other all over Ireland. At long last, the brown bull 
killed the white bull, and Queen Meadhbh was finally satisfied. But the brown bull’s victory 
meant nothing to him. He was tired, injured, and devastated. Soon after, he died of a broken heart, 
leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged 
by Meadhbh’s war for years to come.

from the bones of sea monsters that lay at the bottom of the ocean. Cu Chulainn called the spear, 
stabbed Ferdiad to death, and collapsed. Meadhbh seized her chance 
and swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering
from their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadhbh
crossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown bull with her. Once home, Meadhbh 
demanded another battle, this time between the brown bull 
and her husband’s white bull. The bulls were well matched, 
and struggled into the night, dragging each other all over Ireland. At long last, the brown bull 
killed the white bull, and Queen Meadhbh was finally satisfied. But the brown bull’s victory 
meant nothing to him. He was tired, injured, and devastated. Soon after, he died of a broken heart, 
leaving behind a land that would remain ravaged 
by Meadhbh’s war for years to come.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, 
one animal breaks the morning silence. Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem. Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce 
large three-dimensional structures, which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies that house and protect 
countless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life. Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many 
of the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact. This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system 
of social networks, parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive— and more of these fish 
means less seaweed. Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed. Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research, while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges. Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies for preserving these essential ecosystems.

**Transcript**:
As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, 
one animal breaks the morning silence. Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem. Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce 
large three-dimensional structures, which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies that house and protect 
countless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life. Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many 
of the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact. This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system 
of social networks, parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive— and more of these fish 
means less seaweed. Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed. Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research, while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges. Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies for preserving these essential ecosystems.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, two researchers ran 
a simple experiment. They took everything we know 
about our solar system and calculated where every planet would be
up to 5 billion years in the future. To do so they ran over 2,000 
numerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions
except for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun,
modified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next. Shockingly, in about 1 percent 
of their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically 
that it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized
the entire inner solar system. This was no error; 
the astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system 
may be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing
property of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations 
that can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short 
when faced with more populated systems. It’s actually impossible to write down
all the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion
of three or more gravitating objects. Why? The issue lies in how many unknown
variables an n-body system contains. Thanks to Isaac Newton, 
we can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force 
acting between bodies. However, when trying to find a general 
solution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with 
a mathematical constraint: for each unknown, 
there must be at least one equation that independently describes it. Initially, a two-body system appears 
to have more unknown variables for position and velocity 
than equations of motion. However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position 
and velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center 
of gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns
and leaves us with a solvable system. With three or more orbiting objects 
in the picture, everything gets messier. Even with the same mathematical trick 
of considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns 
than equations describing them. There are simply too many variables
for this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution. But what does it actually look like 
for objects in our universe to move according to analytically 
unsolvable equations of motion? A system of three stars—
like Alpha Centauri— could come crashing
into one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit 
after a long time of apparent stability. Other than a few highly improbable 
stable configurations, almost every possible case 
is unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range
of potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences
in position and velocity. This behaviour is known 
as chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic 
of n-body systems. Such a system is still deterministic—
meaning there’s nothing random about it. If multiple systems start 
from the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result. But give one a little shove at the start,
and all bets are off. That’s clearly relevant 
for human space missions, when complicated orbits need 
to be calculated with great precision. Thankfully, continuous advancements
in computer simulations offer a number of ways
to avoid catastrophe. By approximating the solutions 
with increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion
of n-body systems on long time-scales. And if one body in a group 
of three is so light it exerts no significant force 
on the other two, the system behaves, with very good 
approximation, as a two-body system. This approach is known 
as the “restricted three-body problem.” It proves extremely useful 
in describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun 
gravitational field, or a small planet in the field 
of a black hole and a star. As for our solar system, 
you’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence
in its stability for at least the next 
several hundred million years. Though if another star, launched from across the galaxy, 
is on its way to us, all bets are off.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, two researchers ran 
a simple experiment. They took everything we know 
about our solar system and calculated where every planet would be
up to 5 billion years in the future. To do so they ran over 2,000 
numerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions
except for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun,
modified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next. Shockingly, in about 1 percent 
of their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically 
that it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized
the entire inner solar system. This was no error; 
the astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system 
may be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing
property of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations 
that can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short 
when faced with more populated systems. It’s actually impossible to write down
all the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion
of three or more gravitating objects. Why? The issue lies in how many unknown
variables an n-body system contains. Thanks to Isaac Newton, 
we can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force 
acting between bodies. However, when trying to find a general 
solution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with 
a mathematical constraint: for each unknown, 
there must be at least one equation that independently describes it. Initially, a two-body system appears 
to have more unknown variables for position and velocity 
than equations of motion. However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position 
and velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center 
of gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns
and leaves us with a solvable system. With three or more orbiting objects 
in the picture, everything gets messier. Even with the same mathematical trick 
of considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns 
than equations describing them. There are simply too many variables
for this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution. But what does it actually look like 
for objects in our universe to move according to analytically 
unsolvable equations of motion? A system of three stars—
like Alpha Centauri— could come crashing
into one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit 
after a long time of apparent stability. Other than a few highly improbable 
stable configurations, almost every possible case 
is unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range
of potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences
in position and velocity. This behaviour is known 
as chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic 
of n-body systems. Such a system is still deterministic—
meaning there’s nothing random about it. If multiple systems start 
from the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result. But give one a little shove at the start,
and all bets are off. That’s clearly relevant 
for human space missions, when complicated orbits need 
to be calculated with great precision. Thankfully, continuous advancements
in computer simulations offer a number of ways
to avoid catastrophe. By approximating the solutions 
with increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion
of n-body systems on long time-scales. And if one body in a group 
of three is so light it exerts no significant force 
on the other two, the system behaves, with very good 
approximation, as a two-body system. This approach is known 
as the “restricted three-body problem.” It proves extremely useful 
in describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun 
gravitational field, or a small planet in the field 
of a black hole and a star. As for our solar system, 
you’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence
in its stability for at least the next 
several hundred million years. Though if another star, launched from across the galaxy, 
is on its way to us, all bets are off.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re a biologist on a mission to keep the rare honeybee 
Apis Trifecta from going extinct. The last 60 bees of the species 
are in your terrarium. You’ve already constructed wire frames
of the appropriate size and shape. Now you need to turn 
them into working beehives by helping the bees fill 
every hex with wax. There are two ways to fill a given hex. The first is to place a bee into it. Once placed, a bee cannot 
be removed without killing it. The second: if at any point an unfilled hex has three
or more neighboring wax-filled hexes, the bees already in the hive 
will move in and transform it. Once the bees have transformed 
every hex in a hive, you can place an additional bee inside
and it’ll specialize into a queen. The hive, if well cared for, 
will eventually produce new bees and continue the species. If there are no hexes with three or more 
transformed neighbors, the bees will just sit and wait. And once a bee transforms a hex, 
it can never become a queen. You could put 59 bees in one wire hive,
wait till they transform all the hexes, and then create a queen. But then just one collapse 
would end the species. The more viable hives 
you can make now, the better. So how many can you make with 60 bees? Pause the video to figure
it out yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Answer in 0 What you're looking for here is some 
kind of self-sustaining chain reaction, where a small number of bees 
will transform an entire hive. The lower the number of bees needed,
the better. So how low can we go, 
and how can we engineer a chain reaction? Let’s start with the first question. There's a really clever approach to this, which involves counting the sides 
of the filled-in hexes, and examining their total perimeter. Let’s suppose we put bees 
in these three hexes. The total transformed 
perimeter has 18 sides. But the middle hex 
has three transformed neighbors, so the bees will transform it too. What happens to the perimeter? It’s still 18! And even after the bees transform the next
sets of hexes with three neighbors, it still won’t change. What’s going on here? Each hex that has at least three sides 
touching the bee-friendly space will remove those sides from the perimeter
when it transforms. Then it adds at most three new sides 
to the perimeter. So the perimeter of the transformed hexes
will either stay the same or shrink. The final perimeter 
of the entire hive is 54, so the total perimeter of the hexes 
we place bees in at the start must be at least 54 as well. Dividing that 54 by the six sides 
on each non-adjacent hex tells us it’ll take at least 9 bees 
to transform the entire hive. That’s a great start, but we still have the tough question 
of where the nine bees should go, and if we’ll need more. Let’s think smaller. We already know that three bees could
completely transform a hive this big. What about a slightly bigger one? The perimeter of this hive is 30, which means we’ll need 
at least 5 bees to fill it in. With 6 it’d be easy. Placing them like this would fill out 
the whole hive in just three steps. But we can do better! We don’t actually need to place 
a bee on this hex, since the other bees will transform
that spot on their own. It looks like we have 
the beginning of a pattern. Can we extend it to our full hive? That would mean placing 
our 9 bees like so. Once they get to work, 
they’ll create a chain reaction that fills in the center of the hive 
and extend it to its edges. Add a 10th bee to the completed hive 
and it becomes a queen. Repeat that process five more times and you’ve helped the last 60 members
of Apis trifecta create 6 producing hives. All in all, 
it’s a pretty good bee-ginning.

transformed neighbors, the bees will just sit and wait. And once a bee transforms a hex, 
it can never become a queen. You could put 59 bees in one wire hive,
wait till they transform all the hexes, and then create a queen. But then just one collapse 
would end the species. The more viable hives 
you can make now, the better. So how many can you make with 60 bees? Pause the video to figure
it out yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Answer in 0 What you're looking for here is some 
kind of self-sustaining chain reaction, where a small number of bees 
will transform an entire hive. The lower the number of bees needed,
the better. So how low can we go, 
and how can we engineer a chain reaction? Let’s start with the first question. There's a really clever approach to this, which involves counting the sides 
of the filled-in hexes, and examining their total perimeter. Let’s suppose we put bees 
in these three hexes. The total transformed 
perimeter has 18 sides. But the middle hex 
has three transformed neighbors, so the bees will transform it too. What happens to the perimeter? It’s still 18! And even after the bees transform the next
sets of hexes with three neighbors, it still won’t change. What’s going on here? Each hex that has at least three sides 
touching the bee-friendly space will remove those sides from the perimeter
when it transforms. Then it adds at most three new sides 
to the perimeter. So the perimeter of the transformed hexes
will either stay the same or shrink. The final perimeter 
of the entire hive is 54, so the total perimeter of the hexes 
we place bees in at the start must be at least 54 as well. Dividing that 54 by the six sides 
on each non-adjacent hex tells us it’ll take at least 9 bees 
to transform the entire hive. That’s a great start, but we still have the tough question 
of where the nine bees should go, and if we’ll need more. Let’s think smaller. We already know that three bees could
completely transform a hive this big. What about a slightly bigger one? The perimeter of this hive is 30, which means we’ll need 
at least 5 bees to fill it in. With 6 it’d be easy. Placing them like this would fill out 
the whole hive in just three steps. But we can do better! We don’t actually need to place 
a bee on this hex, since the other bees will transform
that spot on their own. It looks like we have 
the beginning of a pattern. Can we extend it to our full hive? That would mean placing 
our 9 bees like so. Once they get to work, 
they’ll create a chain reaction that fills in the center of the hive 
and extend it to its edges. Add a 10th bee to the completed hive 
and it becomes a queen. Repeat that process five more times and you’ve helped the last 60 members
of Apis trifecta create 6 producing hives. All in all, 
it’s a pretty good bee-ginning.

You’re a biologist on a mission to keep the rare honeybee

**Transcript**:
A few years ago, you founded a company
that manufactures meatless burgers. Your product is now sold 
in stores worldwide. But you’ve recently received awful news: three unrelated people in one city died
after eating your burgers. The police concluded that a criminal 
targeted your brand, injecting poison into your product 
in at least two grocery stores. The culprit used an ultrafine instrument 
that left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine 
which products were compromised. Your burgers were immediately
removed from the two stores where the victims bought them. The deaths are headline news, the killer is still at large, 
and sales have plummeted. You must quickly develop a strategy 
to deal with the crisis. Your team comes up with three options: 1. Do nothing. 2. Pull the products from grocery stores 
citywide and destroy them. Or 3. Pull and destroy 
the product worldwide. Which do you choose? Your company lawyer explains 
that a recall is not required by law because the criminal is fully responsible. She recommends the first option— 
doing nothing— because recalling the product 
could look like an admission of fault. But is that the most ethical strategy? To gauge the ethicality of each choice, you could perform 
a “stakeholder analysis.” This would allow you to weigh 
the interests of some key stakeholders— investors, employees, and customers—
against one another. With the first option your advisors project that the crisis 
will eventually blow over. Sales will then improve but probably 
stay below prior levels because of damage to the brand. As a result, you’ll have to lay off 
some employees, and investors will suffer minor losses. But more customers could die 
if the killer poisoned packages elsewhere. The second option is expensive
in the short-term and will require greater employee layoffs and additional financial loss 
to investors. But this option is safer 
for customers in the city and could create enough trust 
that sales will eventually rebound. The third option is the most expensive 
in the short-term and will require significant 
employee layoffs and investor losses. Though you have no evidence that these
crimes are an international threat, this option provides the greatest
customer protection. Given the conflict between the interests
of your customers versus those of your investors 
and employees, which strategy is the most ethical? To make this decision, 
you could consider these tests: First is the Utilitarian Test: Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned with maximizing the greatest amount 
of good for the greatest number of people. What would be the impact of each
option on these terms? Second is the Family Test: How would you feel
explaining your decision to your family? Third is the Newspaper Test: how would you feel reading about it 
on the front page of the local newspaper? And finally, you could use 
the Mentor Test: If someone you admire were making 
this decision, what would they do? Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke 
faced a similar challenge in 1982 after a criminal added the poison cyanide
to bottles of Tylenol in Chicago. Seven people died and sales dropped. Industry analysts said 
the company was done for. In response, Burke decided to pull Tylenol
from all shelves worldwide, citing customer safety 
as the company’s highest priority. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed
an estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol valued at 250 million in today’s dollars. 1.5 million of the recalled bottles 
were tested and 3 of them— all from the Chicago area— were found to contain cyanide. Burke’s decision helped the company 
regain the trust of its customers, and product sales rebounded within a year. Prompted by the Tylenol murders, 
Johnson & Johnson became a leader in developing tamper-resistant packaging and the government instituted 
stricter regulations. The killer, meanwhile, was never caught. Burke’s decision prevented further deaths
from the initial poisoning, but the federal government investigated
hundreds of copycat tampering incidents involving other products 
in the following weeks. Could these have been prevented 
with a different response? Was Burke acting in the interest 
of the public or of his company? Was this good ethics or good marketing? As with all ethical dilemmas, 
this has no clear right or wrong answer. And for your meatless burger empire,
the choice remains yours.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why was it so difficult to determine which of the meatless burger products were tampered with?
Options: A. Because the criminal bribed the security guard., B. Because all of the packages had visible air holes., C. Because the tampering occurred at the manufacturer before the burgers were sent to stores., D. Because the tampering was not evident on the packaging/product.
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What was the reason for the deaths of three unrelated people in one city after eating the company's meatless burgers?

from all shelves worldwide, citing customer safety 
as the company’s highest priority. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed
an estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol valued at 250 million in today’s dollars. 1.5 million of the recalled bottles 
were tested and 3 of them— all from the Chicago area— were found to contain cyanide. Burke’s decision helped the company 
regain the trust of its customers, and product sales rebounded within a year. Prompted by the Tylenol murders, 
Johnson & Johnson became a leader in developing tamper-resistant packaging and the government instituted 
stricter regulations. The killer, meanwhile, was never caught. Burke’s decision prevented further deaths
from the initial poisoning, but the federal government investigated
hundreds of copycat tampering incidents involving other products 
in the following weeks. Could these have been prevented 
with a different response? Was Burke acting in the interest 
of the public or of his company? Was this good ethics or good marketing? As with all ethical dilemmas, 
this has no clear right or wrong answer. And for your meatless burger empire,
the choice remains yours.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A few years ago, you founded a company
that manufactures meatless burgers. Your product is now sold 
in stores worldwide. But you’ve recently received awful news: three unrelated people in one city died
after eating your burgers. The police concluded that a criminal 
targeted your brand, injecting poison into your product 
in at least two grocery stores. The culprit used an ultrafine instrument 
that left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine 
which products were compromised. Your burgers were immediately
removed from the two stores where the victims bought them. The deaths are headline news, the killer is still at large, 
and sales have plummeted. You must quickly develop a strategy 
to deal with the crisis. Your team comes up with three options: 1. Do nothing. 2. Pull the products from grocery stores 
citywide and destroy them. Or 3. Pull and destroy 
the product worldwide. Which do you choose? Your company lawyer explains 
that a recall is not required by law because the criminal is fully responsible. She recommends the first option— 
doing nothing— because recalling the product 
could look like an admission of fault. But is that the most ethical strategy? To gauge the ethicality of each choice, you could perform 
a “stakeholder analysis.” This would allow you to weigh 
the interests of some key stakeholders— investors, employees, and customers—
against one another. With the first option your advisors project that the crisis 
will eventually blow over. Sales will then improve but probably 
stay below prior levels because of damage to the brand. As a result, you’ll have to lay off 
some employees, and investors will suffer minor losses. But more customers could die 
if the killer poisoned packages elsewhere. The second option is expensive
in the short-term and will require greater employee layoffs and additional financial loss 
to investors. But this option is safer 
for customers in the city and could create enough trust 
that sales will eventually rebound. The third option is the most expensive 
in the short-term and will require significant 
employee layoffs and investor losses. Though you have no evidence that these
crimes are an international threat, this option provides the greatest
customer protection. Given the conflict between the interests
of your customers versus those of your investors 
and employees, which strategy is the most ethical? To make this decision, 
you could consider these tests: First is the Utilitarian Test: Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned with maximizing the greatest amount 
of good for the greatest number of people. What would be the impact of each
option on these terms? Second is the Family Test: How would you feel
explaining your decision to your family? Third is the Newspaper Test: how would you feel reading about it 
on the front page of the local newspaper? And finally, you could use 
the Mentor Test: If someone you admire were making 
this decision, what would they do? Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke 
faced a similar challenge in 1982 after a criminal added the poison cyanide
to bottles of Tylenol in Chicago. Seven people died and sales dropped. Industry analysts said

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The average 20 year old knows 
between 27,000 and 52,000 different words. By age 60, that number averages 
between 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words 
last less than a second. So with every word, the brain 
has a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options 
matches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses
the correct word. But how? Speech comprehension is different
from reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language 
comprehension— though spoken word recognition 
has been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability 
to understand speech is the brain’s role 
as a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple 
different things at the same time. Most theories assume 
that each word we know is represented by a separate processing 
unit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming 
speech matching that particular word. In the context of the brain, 
the processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity 
across a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units 
may become active, because with just the beginning 
of a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, 
more and more units register that some vital piece of information 
is missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, 
corresponding to one word. This is called the "recognition point." In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress 
the activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend 
up to about 8 syllables per second. Yet, the goal is not only 
to recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings
at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show 
that even upon hearing a word fragment— like "cap"— listeners will start to register 
multiple possible meanings, like captain or capital,
before the full word emerges. This suggests that every time 
we hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings 
in our minds, and by the recognition point the brain 
has settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves 
more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context 
than in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards 
the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, 
like "bat," or "crane," or in cases of homophones
like "no" or "know." For multilingual people, the language
they are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words
that don’t match the language context. So, what about adding completely 
new words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across 
a new word every few days. But if every word is represented 
as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words 
from overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part 
of the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store 
of words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons
with others words. Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer 
over and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual
acquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words. So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions
of meaning as we chat away. At night, we rest, but our brains 
are busy integrating new knowledge into the word network. When we wake up, this process ensures 
that we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 15, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 7
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The average 20 year old knows 
between 27,000 and 52,000 different words. By age 60, that number averages 
between 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words 
last less than a second. So with every word, the brain 
has a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options 
matches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses
the correct word. But how? Speech comprehension is different
from reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language 
comprehension— though spoken word recognition 
has been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability 
to understand speech is the brain’s role 
as a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple 
different things at the same time. Most theories assume 
that each word we know is represented by a separate processing 
unit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming 
speech matching that particular word. In the context of the brain, 
the processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity 
across a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units 
may become active, because with just the beginning 
of a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, 
more and more units register that some vital piece of information 
is missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, 
corresponding to one word. This is called the "recognition point." In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress 
the activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend 
up to about 8 syllables per second. Yet, the goal is not only 
to recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings
at the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show 
that even upon hearing a word fragment— like "cap"— listeners will start to register 
multiple possible meanings, like captain or capital,
before the full word emerges. This suggests that every time 
we hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings 
in our minds, and by the recognition point the brain 
has settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves 
more rapidly with a sentence that gives us context 
than in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards 
the intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, 
like "bat," or "crane," or in cases of homophones
like "no" or "know." For multilingual people, the language
they are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words
that don’t match the language context. So, what about adding completely 
new words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across 
a new word every few days. But if every word is represented 
as a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words 
from overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part 
of the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store 
of words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons
with others words. Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer 
over and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual
acquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words. So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions
of meaning as we chat away. At night, we rest, but our brains 
are busy integrating new knowledge into the word network. When we wake up, this process ensures 
that we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1900s on the island of Crete, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
uncovered nearly 3,000 tablets inscribed with strange symbols. He thought these symbols represented
the language spoken by Europe’s oldest civilization. Their meaning would elude scholars 
for 50 years. Evans discovered these tablets 
amid the colorful frescoes and maze-like hallways
of the palace of Knossos. He called the civilization Minoan— after the mythical Cretan ruler, 
King Minos. He thought the script, dubbed Linear B,
represented the Minoan language, and scholars all over the world 
came up with their own theories. Was it the lost language of the Etruscans? Or perhaps it represented 
an early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans
guarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions 
were published during his lifetime–– but he couldn’t decipher the script. However, he did make 
two accurate observations: the tablets were administrative records,
and the script was a syllabary, where each symbol represented 
both a consonant and a vowel, mixed with characters 
that each represented a whole word. Evans worked on Linear B for three decades
before a scholar from Brooklyn, New York, named Alice Kober 
set out to solve the mystery. Kober was a professor 
of Classics at Brooklyn College when few women held such positions. To help in her quest, she taught herself
many languages–– knowledge she knew she would need 
to decipher Linear B. For the next two decades, 
she analyzed the symbols. Working from the few 
available inscriptions, she recorded how often 
each symbol appeared. Then she recorded how frequently 
each symbol appeared next to another. She stored her findings on scrap paper 
in cigarette cartons because writing supplies were scarce 
during the Second World War. By analyzing these frequencies, she discovered that Linear B 
relied on word endings to give its sentences grammar. From this she began to build a chart 
of the relations between the signs, coming closer than anyone before 
to deciphering Linear B. But she died, probably of cancer, 
in 1950 at the age of 43. While Kober was analyzing 
the Knossos tablets, an architect named Michael Ventris 
was also working to crack Linear B. He had become obsessed with Linear B
as a schoolboy after hearing Evans speak. He even worked on deciphering 
the script while serving in World War II. After the war, Ventris 
built on Kober’s grid using a newly published cache 
of Linear B inscriptions excavated from a different archeological
site called Pylos, on mainland Greece. His real breakthrough came 
when he compared the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos and saw that certain words appeared on
tablets from one site but not the other. He wondered if those words represented
the names of places specific to each location. He knew that over centuries, place names
tend to remain constant, and decided to compare Linear B to an ancient syllabary 
from the island of Cyprus. The Cypriot script was used 
hundreds of years after Linear B, but some of the symbols were similar— he wondered if the sounds 
would be similar, too. When Ventris plugged some of the sounds 
of the Cypriot syllabary into the Linear B inscriptions, he came up with the word Knossos, the name of the city where Evans 
had discovered his tablets. In a domino effect, 
Ventris unraveled Linear B, with each word revealing more clearly 
that the language of Linear B was not Minoan, but Greek. Ventris died in a car crash four years 
later, at the age of 34. But his discovery rewrote 
a chapter of history. Evans had insisted that the Minoans 
conquered the mainland Greeks, and that was why examples of Linear B 
were found on the mainland. But the discovery that Linear B 
represented Greek, and not Minoan, showed that the opposite had happened: mainland Greeks invaded Crete and adopted
the Minoan script for their own language. But the story isn’t over yet. The actual language of the Minoans, represented by another script 
called Linear A, has yet to be deciphered. It remains a mystery—
at least for now.

an early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans
guarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions 
were published during his lifetime–– but he couldn’t decipher the script. However, he did make 
two accurate observations: the tablets were administrative records,
and the script was a syllabary, where each symbol represented 
both a consonant and a vowel, mixed with characters 
that each represented a whole word. Evans worked on Linear B for three decades
before a scholar from Brooklyn, New York, named Alice Kober 
set out to solve the mystery. Kober was a professor 
of Classics at Brooklyn College when few women held such positions. To help in her quest, she taught herself
many languages–– knowledge she knew she would need 
to decipher Linear B. For the next two decades, 
she analyzed the symbols. Working from the few 
available inscriptions, she recorded how often 
each symbol appeared. Then she recorded how frequently 
each symbol appeared next to another. She stored her findings on scrap paper 
in cigarette cartons because writing supplies were scarce 
during the Second World War. By analyzing these frequencies, she discovered that Linear B 
relied on word endings to give its sentences grammar. From this she began to build a chart 
of the relations between the signs, coming closer than anyone before 
to deciphering Linear B. But she died, probably of cancer, 
in 1950 at the age of 43. While Kober was analyzing 
the Knossos tablets, an architect named Michael Ventris 
was also working to crack Linear B. He had become obsessed with Linear B
as a schoolboy after hearing Evans speak. He even worked on deciphering 
the script while serving in World War II. After the war, Ventris 
built on Kober’s grid using a newly published cache 
of Linear B inscriptions excavated from a different archeological
site called Pylos, on mainland Greece. His real breakthrough came 
when he compared the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos and saw that certain words appeared on
tablets from one site but not the other. He wondered if those words represented
the names of places specific to each location. He knew that over centuries, place names
tend to remain constant, and decided to compare Linear B to an ancient syllabary 
from the island of Cyprus. The Cypriot script was used 
hundreds of years after Linear B, but some of the symbols were similar— he wondered if the sounds 
would be similar, too. When Ventris plugged some of the sounds 
of the Cypriot syllabary into the Linear B inscriptions, he came up with the word Knossos, the name of the city where Evans 
had discovered his tablets. In a domino effect, 
Ventris unraveled Linear B, with each word revealing more clearly 
that the language of Linear B was not Minoan, but Greek. Ventris died in a car crash four years 
later, at the age of 34. But his discovery rewrote 
a chapter of history. Evans had insisted that the Minoans 
conquered the mainland Greeks, and that was why examples of Linear B 
were found on the mainland. But the discovery that Linear B 
represented Greek, and not Minoan, showed that the opposite had happened: mainland Greeks invaded Crete and adopted
the Minoan script for their own language. But the story isn’t over yet. The actual language of the Minoans, represented by another script 
called Linear A, has yet to be deciphered. It remains a mystery—
at least for now.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1900s on the island of Crete, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
uncovered nearly 3,000 tablets inscribed with strange symbols. He thought these symbols represented
the language spoken by Europe’s oldest civilization. Their meaning would elude scholars 
for 50 years. Evans discovered these tablets 
amid the colorful frescoes and maze-like hallways
of the palace of Knossos. He called the civilization Minoan— after the mythical Cretan ruler, 
King Minos. He thought the script, dubbed Linear B,
represented the Minoan language, and scholars all over the world 
came up with their own theories. Was it the lost language of the Etruscans? Or perhaps it represented 
an early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans
guarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions

**Transcript**:
In February of 1942, 
Mexican farmer Dionisio Pulido thought he heard thunder 
coming from his cornfield. However, the sound wasn’t coming 
from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack 
emitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as 
the volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava 
and ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered 
its unpredictable eruption? The story of any volcano 
begins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms 
in areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle 
and lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains 
under the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance 
of three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust 
pushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, 
magmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces 
strains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough 
and heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, 
the consequences can be explosive. One of the most common causes 
of an eruption is an increase 
in magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements 
and compounds, many of which are dissolved 
in the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds 
like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form 
high-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force 
of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles 
explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash 
into the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act 
like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers 
the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force 
pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process 
was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes 
for these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma 
from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds 
into the mix. But bubbles can also form 
when magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture
of dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those 
minerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate 
many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration 
of the compounds that form explosive bubbles. Not all eruptions are due 
to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock 
above can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities 
of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure 
and instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible 
for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion 
of Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen 
over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists 
are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change 
could increase volcanic activity. Finally, eruptions can occur when 
the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process 
called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone 
into soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened 
by tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures 
allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust 
can be stretched thin as continental plates 
shift away from each other. Unfortunately, knowing 
what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine 
the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers 
makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly 
exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging 
have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze 
gases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact 
of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better
understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The Earth’s upper mantle melts and forms magma when water is present and lowers the melting point of mantle rocks. How does water get into the upper mantle?

of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles 
explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash 
into the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act 
like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers 
the magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force 
pushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process 
was behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes 
for these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma 
from deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds 
into the mix. But bubbles can also form 
when magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture
of dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those 
minerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate 
many of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration 
of the compounds that form explosive bubbles. Not all eruptions are due 
to rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock 
above can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities 
of rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure 
and instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible 
for numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion 
of Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen 
over longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists 
are worried that glacial melt caused by climate change 
could increase volcanic activity. Finally, eruptions can occur when 
the rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process 
called hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone 
into soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened 
by tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures 
allowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust 
can be stretched thin as continental plates 
shift away from each other. Unfortunately, knowing 
what causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine 
the strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers 
makes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly 
exploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging 
have allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze 
gases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact 
of rising magma on a volcano’s shape. Hopefully, these tools will help us better
understand these volatile vents and their explosive eruptions.

**Transcript**:
In February of 1942, 
Mexican farmer Dionisio Pulido thought he heard thunder 
coming from his cornfield. However, the sound wasn’t coming 
from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack 
emitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as 
the volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava 
and ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered 
its unpredictable eruption? The story of any volcano 
begins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms 
in areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle 
and lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains 
under the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance 
of three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust 
pushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, 
magmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces 
strains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough 
and heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, 
the consequences can be explosive. One of the most common causes 
of an eruption is an increase 
in magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements 
and compounds, many of which are dissolved 
in the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds 
like water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form 
high-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force 
of a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles 
explode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash

**Transcript**:
On January 17, 1920, six armed men 
robbed a Chicago freight train. But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits 
had become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands 
of dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended 
consequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production 
and sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels 
of a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure 
during World War I. But the view in the Western world 
of alcohol as a primary cause of social ills 
was much older. It first gained traction 
during the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers 
poured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups
called temperance movements began to appear in the United States 
and parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed 
that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty 
and domestic violence, and set out to convince 
governments of this. While some simply advocated 
moderate drinking, many believed alcohol 
should be banned entirely. These movements drew support 
from broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active 
participants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect
their families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, 
especially Protestants, denounced alcohol 
as leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists 
believed alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers 
to the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, 
white settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting 
these communities— though there were many other 
destructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments
banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations 
and on reservation land. American temperance movements gained
their first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states 
banning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment 
to the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, 
and transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later
under the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban 
personal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity 
to stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, 
breweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups 
rushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market 
in producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side 
with corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election
for Illinois state attorney in support of a particular 
political faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars, 
known as "speakeasies," began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars 
to elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol 
at home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s 
prescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol 
from being consumed, the government required manufacturers
to add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people
were drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol 
wasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition 
had not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political 
corruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, 
the local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great 
Depression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax
revenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition 
would stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st
Amendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol 
was the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely 
didn’t work, the health and social impacts 
of alcohol remain concerns today.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On January 17, 1920, six armed men 
robbed a Chicago freight train. But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits 
had become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands 
of dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended 
consequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production 
and sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels 
of a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure 
during World War I. But the view in the Western world 
of alcohol as a primary cause of social ills 
was much older. It first gained traction 
during the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers 
poured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups
called temperance movements began to appear in the United States 
and parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed 
that alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty 
and domestic violence, and set out to convince 
governments of this. While some simply advocated 
moderate drinking, many believed alcohol 
should be banned entirely. These movements drew support 
from broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active 
participants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect
their families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, 
especially Protestants, denounced alcohol 
as leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists 
believed alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers 
to the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, 
white settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting 
these communities— though there were many other 
destructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments
banned the sale of alcohol to Native populations 
and on reservation land. American temperance movements gained
their first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states 
banning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment 
to the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, 
and transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later
under the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban 
personal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity 
to stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, 
breweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups 
rushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market 
in producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side 
with corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election
for Illinois state attorney in support of a particular 
political faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars, 
known as "speakeasies," began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars 
to elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol 
at home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s 
prescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol 
from being consumed, the government required manufacturers
to add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people
were drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol 
wasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition 
had not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political 
corruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, 
the local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great 
Depression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax
revenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition 
would stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st
Amendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol 
was the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely

**Transcript**:
Ragnarok. The fabled end of the world, when giants, monsters, and Norse gods 
battle for the future. The gods were winning handily until 
the great serpent Jörmungandr emerged. It swallowed Valhalla, 
contorted itself across the land, and then merged into one continuous body 
with no head and no tail. As it begins to digest Valhalla, an exhausted Odin explains that he has 
just enough power to strike the creature with one final bolt of lightning. If you magnify his blast 
with your fabled hammer, Mjölnir, it should pierce the massive serpent. You’ll run with super-speed 
along the serpent’s body. When you hold your hammer high, 
Odin will strike it with lightning and split Jörmungandr open at that point. Then, you’ll need to continue 
running along its body until every part of it is destroyed. You can’t run over the same section twice or you’ll fall into the already blasted 
part of the snake. But you can make multiple passes 
through points where the creature intersects its own body. If you leave any portion un-zapped, 
Jörmungandr will magically regenerate, Odin’s last power will be spent, 
and Valhalla will fall forever. What path can you take to destroy 
the serpent? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 2 1 One powerful way to solve problems 
is to simplify. And in this case, we can focus 
our attention on the two things that are important for our path: intersections and the stretches 
of snake between them. Or, as they’re referred 
to in graph theory, nodes and edges. The edges are important 
because they’re what we need to travel. And the nodes matter 
because they connect the edges, and are where we may need to make choices 
as we run from edge to edge. This simplification into nodes 
and edges leaves us with a ubiquitous and important 
mathematical object known as a graph, or network. We just need to figure out how to travel 
what mathematicians call an Eulerian path, which traces every edge exactly once. Instead of looking at the path as a whole,
let’s zoom in on a single node. During some moment in your run, 
you’ll enter that node, and then exit it. That takes care of two edges. If you enter again, 
you’ll need to exit again too, which requires another pair of edges. So every point along your path 
will have edges that come in pairs. One edge in each pair will function 
as entrance; the other as exit. And that means that the number of edges 
coming out of every node must be even. There are just two exceptions: 
the start and end points, where you can exit 
without entering, or vice versa. If we look at the network 
formed by the serpent again, and number how many edges 
emerge from each node, a pattern jumps out that fits 
what we just saw. Every node has an even number 
of edges emerging from it, except two. So one of these must be the start 
of your route, and the other the end. Interestingly enough, any connected 
network that has exactly 2 nodes with an odd number of edges 
will also contain an Eulerian path. The same is true if there are no nodes 
with an odd number of edges— in that case the path starts 
and ends in the same spot. So knowing that, 
let’s return to our full graph. We can begin by taking care 
of this edge here. Now we can zig-zag back and forth 
across the whole snake until we reach the end. And that's just one solution— 
it helps to be systematic, but you’re likely to happen 
upon many others once you know where to begin 
and end your run. You hold your hammer high 
at the opportune moment, and Odin sends the world-saving surge 
of lightning at you. Then you run 
like you’ve never run before. If you can pull this off, surely nothing 
could stop the might of the Norse Gods. And if something like that were out there,
slouching its way towards you… well, that would be a story 
for another day.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Ragnarok. The fabled end of the world, when giants, monsters, and Norse gods 
battle for the future. The gods were winning handily until 
the great serpent Jörmungandr emerged. It swallowed Valhalla, 
contorted itself across the land, and then merged into one continuous body 
with no head and no tail. As it begins to digest Valhalla, an exhausted Odin explains that he has 
just enough power to strike the creature with one final bolt of lightning. If you magnify his blast 
with your fabled hammer, Mjölnir, it should pierce the massive serpent. You’ll run with super-speed 
along the serpent’s body. When you hold your hammer high, 
Odin will strike it with lightning and split Jörmungandr open at that point. Then, you’ll need to continue 
running along its body until every part of it is destroyed. You can’t run over the same section twice or you’ll fall into the already blasted 
part of the snake. But you can make multiple passes 
through points where the creature intersects its own body. If you leave any portion un-zapped, 
Jörmungandr will magically regenerate, Odin’s last power will be spent, 
and Valhalla will fall forever. What path can you take to destroy 
the serpent? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 2 1 One powerful way to solve problems 
is to simplify. And in this case, we can focus 
our attention on the two things that are important for our path: intersections and the stretches 
of snake between them. Or, as they’re referred 
to in graph theory, nodes and edges. The edges are important 
because they’re what we need to travel. And the nodes matter 
because they connect the edges, and are where we may need to make choices 
as we run from edge to edge. This simplification into nodes 
and edges leaves us with a ubiquitous and important 
mathematical object known as a graph, or network. We just need to figure out how to travel 
what mathematicians call an Eulerian path, which traces every edge exactly once. Instead of looking at the path as a whole,
let’s zoom in on a single node. During some moment in your run, 
you’ll enter that node, and then exit it. That takes care of two edges. If you enter again, 
you’ll need to exit again too, which requires another pair of edges. So every point along your path 
will have edges that come in pairs. One edge in each pair will function 
as entrance; the other as exit. And that means that the number of edges 
coming out of every node must be even. There are just two exceptions: 
the start and end points, where you can exit 
without entering, or vice versa. If we look at the network 
formed by the serpent again, and number how many edges 
emerge from each node, a pattern jumps out that fits 
what we just saw. Every node has an even number 
of edges emerging from it, except two. So one of these must be the start 
of your route, and the other the end. Interestingly enough, any connected 
network that has exactly 2 nodes with an odd number of edges 
will also contain an Eulerian path. The same is true if there are no nodes 
with an odd number of edges— in that case the path starts 
and ends in the same spot. So knowing that, 
let’s return to our full graph. We can begin by taking care 
of this edge here. Now we can zig-zag back and forth 
across the whole snake until we reach the end. And that's just one solution— 
it helps to be systematic, but you’re likely to happen 
upon many others once you know where to begin 
and end your run. You hold your hammer high 
at the opportune moment, and Odin sends the world-saving surge 
of lightning at you. Then you run 
like you’ve never run before. If you can pull this off, surely nothing 
could stop the might of the Norse Gods. And if something like that were out there,
slouching its way towards you… well, that would be a story 
for another day.

**Transcript**:
It’s just after sunrise, 
and 16-year-old Mori Banshirô is already hard at work 
practicing drills with his long sword. Banshirô is an ambitious samurai 
in training, and today he must impress 
his teachers more than ever. Today he’ll make his request 
to travel to the capital city of Edo for a year of martial 
and scholarly studies, and he needs their support, 
along with his father’s. The year is 1800 in the castle town 
of Kôchi, capital of the Tosa domain in Japan. The daimyo rules the domain, and about 
1,500 samurai retainers serve him. For 200 years, 
Japan has been at peace, and the samurai, once primarily warriors, 
now play a much wider range of roles— they are also government officials, scholars, teachers, and even masters 
of the tea ceremony or artists. To prepare for these 
diverse responsibilities, young samurai like Banshirô 
study the “twin paths” of literary learning and the martial arts. At 15, he went through the rites 
of adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords. The long sword is for training 
and combat, while the short sword 
has a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, 
or the daimyo. Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai 
Miyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman 
who lived 150 years earlier. But Banshirô doesn’t admire 
his swordsmanship alone. Miyamoto Musashi was also 
a master calligrapher and painter. That’s the real reason 
Banshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too. After finishing his practice at home, 
he bids his father goodbye and walks to school. His father is preparing to accompany 
the daimyo to the capital. The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese 
military government, requires all the regional rulers 
to alternate years between their castle town 
in the home domain and the capital city. The costly treks back and forth 
keep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up 
their own military forces to challenge the shogunate. The daimyo’s wife and children 
live in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages 
to ensure his loyalty. But the practice 
doesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm 
of life in Japan. Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo. This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s 
turn to go, and Banshirô is desperate to go with him; but given that he’s still in training, 
he’ll need permission from both his father and the domain. At school, Banshirô’s first lesson 
is in swordfighting. Under his teacher’s stern eye, 
he pairs up with his classmates and goes through the routines 
he’s been practicing. At the end of the lesson, he reminds the 
instructor of his request to go to Edo. The instructor cracks 
his first smile of the day, and Banshirô feels confident 
he will gain his support. Next, Banshirô practices archery, 
horsemanship, and swimming before his academic courses 
in the afternoon. Courses cover Confucian philosophy, 
morality, and history. When the instructor calls on him, he has 
the response on the tip of his tongue, ensuring another supporter 
for his campaign. By the end of the day, Banshirô 
feels confident that his formal request will be approved, but the greatest 
challenge is still ahead of him: convincing his father. His father believes the martial arts 
are more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention 
his artistic ambitions. Instead, he talks about renowned 
sword instructors he can train with, and teaching certifications he can earn 
to improve his professional prospects back in Kôchi. Then, he makes his final, 
strongest argument: if he goes this time and succeeds, 
his father can retire and send him instead in the future. It’s this last point 
that finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees 
to take him on his tour of duty. In the bustle of the capital city, 
Banshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition 
to become a painter.

**Transcript**:
It’s just after sunrise, 
and 16-year-old Mori Banshirô is already hard at work 
practicing drills with his long sword. Banshirô is an ambitious samurai 
in training, and today he must impress 
his teachers more than ever. Today he’ll make his request 
to travel to the capital city of Edo for a year of martial 
and scholarly studies, and he needs their support, 
along with his father’s. The year is 1800 in the castle town 
of Kôchi, capital of the Tosa domain in Japan. The daimyo rules the domain, and about 
1,500 samurai retainers serve him. For 200 years, 
Japan has been at peace, and the samurai, once primarily warriors, 
now play a much wider range of roles— they are also government officials, scholars, teachers, and even masters 
of the tea ceremony or artists. To prepare for these 
diverse responsibilities, young samurai like Banshirô 
study the “twin paths” of literary learning and the martial arts. At 15, he went through the rites 
of adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords. The long sword is for training 
and combat, while the short sword 
has a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, 
or the daimyo. Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai 
Miyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman 
who lived 150 years earlier. But Banshirô doesn’t admire 
his swordsmanship alone. Miyamoto Musashi was also 
a master calligrapher and painter. That’s the real reason 
Banshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too. After finishing his practice at home, 
he bids his father goodbye and walks to school. His father is preparing to accompany 
the daimyo to the capital. The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese 
military government, requires all the regional rulers 
to alternate years between their castle town 
in the home domain and the capital city. The costly treks back and forth 
keep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up 
their own military forces to challenge the shogunate. The daimyo’s wife and children 
live in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages 
to ensure his loyalty. But the practice 
doesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm 
of life in Japan. Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo. This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s

his father can retire and send him instead in the future. It’s this last point 
that finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees 
to take him on his tour of duty. In the bustle of the capital city, 
Banshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition 
to become a painter.

**Transcript**:
I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah. Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea. These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years. Now, orcas are also
known as killer whales. They're profoundly social
and profoundly intelligent beings. And scientists are very interested
in their behavior, because in their social networks,
they share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean. But this pod has been in trouble. The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor
has been way down in the region, and pollution has been up. But on July 24th, Tahlequah
gave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited
by this development. But unfortunately, the same day --
in fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died. Well, what happened next
electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused
to let her baby slip off into the water. She kept it on her body
and she swam with it. If it did fall off,
she would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this. Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time,
she swam over 1,000 miles. At that point, she let the little baby
slip off into the water. So today, Tahlequah
swims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me. And I do believe that "grief"
is the right word to use. I believe that grief
is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Because these visible cues,
these behavioral cues, tell us something about
an animal's emotional state. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document
examples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals
and in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality
of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge
to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the "a-word." The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically,
it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So, anthropomorphism is when
we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions. And we can all probably
think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, "My cat understands everything I say." Or, "My dog, he's so sweet. he ran right across the yard this morning
towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play." Well, maybe. Or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different, because we're not trying
to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them
with some meaning. Now, it's true -- scientists
often push back at me, and they'll say, "Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine
has been disrupted." But I think that this overworry
about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point. And that is that animals
can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other. And when they do, a survivor's heart
can be pierced by a death. Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out
on embracing part of ourselves. So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world
a better place for animals, a kinder place for animals. So let me tell you a little bit more
about animal grief. I'm going to start in Kenya. You see here there's
an elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed. You see on the left that another female named Grace
came to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet. And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again. At this point, Grace became
visibly distressed, and she prodded the body,
and she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die. What you see on the right is a female
from another family named Maui, who came after the death,
and she stayed at the body. She held a vigil there,
and she even rocked in distress over the body. So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days. And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families. Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe
should be classified as grief. So what does grief look like? It can be rocking, as I said, in distress. It can also be social withdrawal, when an animal just takes
himself or herself away from friends and stays by themselves, or a failure to eat or sleep properly, sometimes a depressed posture
or vocalization. It can be very helpful
for those of us studying this to be able to compare the behavior
of a survivor before death and after death, because that increases the rigor
of our interpretation. And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks
named Harper and Kohl. So we're into birds now. So Harper and Kohl were raised
at a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly. Foie gras does involve
force-feeding of birds. So this hurt their bodies, and their
spirits were not in good shape, either. But thankfully, they were rescued
by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends. They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper
to the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there
for over an hour with his friend. And in the weeks after, he had a hard time. He would go back to that same pond
where he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends. And within two months, he died as well. Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals
have this sorrowful outcome. Last summer, I flew to Boston
to visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie. I really needed a break from work. But I succumbed,
and I checked my work email. You know how that is. And there was a communication
about a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist,
this wasn't what I expected, but there it was, and I'm glad I read it. Because a donkey named Lena
had gone to another farm sanctuary, this one in Alberta, Canada, as the only donkey there, and had trouble making friends
for that reason. But she eventually did make friends
with an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable. But the reason the email came
was that Jake, at age 32, the horse, had become gravely ill
and had to be put down, and this is what was going on. This is Lena standing on Jake's grave. She didn't want to come in at night.
She didn't want to come in for food. She didn't want to come in for water. She pawed at the grave,
she brayed in distress, and there she stood. So we talked and we brainstormed. What do you do for an animal like this? And we talked about the role of time, of extra love and kindness from people and of urging her to make a new friend. And here's where her trajectory does
diverge from that of Harper the duck, because she did make a new friend, and sanctuary workers wrote back
and said it worked out well. Now sometimes, scientists
supplement observation with hormonal analysis. There's an example of a group
of scientists in Botswana, who took fecal material from baboons
and compared two different groups. The first group were females
who had witnessed a predator attack and lost someone in that attack, and the second group were females
who had witnessed an attack but had not lost someone. And the stress hormones
were way up in that first group. But here's the thing: the scientists didn't just
call them "stressed baboons," they called them "bereaved baboons," and in part, that's because
of the observations that they made. For example, this mother-daughter
pair were very close, and then the daughter
was killed by a lion. The mother removed herself
from all her friends, from her grooming networks,
and just stayed by herself for weeks -- bereavement -- and she then slowly recovered. So we have bereaved baboons. Will science tell us someday
about bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason
is because animals really need one-to-one, close relationships
for that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters,
and personality matters. I have documented
cats and dogs who grieve, our companion animals, but I also interacted with a woman
who was extremely bothered because her dog wasn't grieving. She said to me, "The first dog
in the house has died. The second animal does not
seem concerned, the second dog. What is wrong with him?" (Laughter) And as I listened to her, I realized that this dog was now
the only animal in the household, and as far as he was concerned,
that was a pretty good deal. So circumstances matter. Now, in any case, animals
are not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people
we've never met, across space and time. I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean
that their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing, and we can see it if we choose. Now, I've lost both my parents. I lost a very dear friend
at a young age from AIDS. I believe most likely most of you
here have lost someone. And I have found it a genuine comfort, a solace, to know that we aren't
the only beings on this earth who feel love and grief. And I think this is important. I also think we can take
this a step further, and we can realize
that the reality of animal grief can help us be better
and do better for animals. This is already happening with Tahlequah, because the United States and Canada have
renewed their talks with greater urgency for how to help the orcas, how to restore the Chinook salmon and how to help with the water pollution. We can also see that if grief is real, there's tremendous
plausibility to the notion that animals feel a whole range of things. So we could look at joy,
sadness, even hope. And if we do that, here's how we can start
to think about the world. We can look at orcas and say, we know they grieve,
we know they feel their lives, and we can refuse to confine them
to small tanks in theme parks and make them perform
for our entertainment. (Applause) Thank you. We can look at elephants
and say, yes, they grieve, and we can renew our efforts
against international trophy hunting and against poaching. (Applause) Thank you. And we can look at our closest
living relatives, monkeys and apes, and know yes they grieve,
they feel their lives, so they don't deserve to be confined in highly invasive biomedical experiments year after year. And, you know -- (Applause) the ducks Harper and Kohl,
they tell us something too. They help us connect the dots
and realize that what we eat affects how animals live. And it's not just foie gras,
and it's not just ducks. We can think about pigs and chickens
and cows in factory farms, and we can know. I can tell you the science is real
that these animals feel, too. So every single time
we choose a plant-based meal, we are contributing
to reducing animal suffering. (Applause) So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief. I believe in the reality of animal love, and I think it is time for us humans to recognize that
we don't own these things. And when we see that, we have an opportunity to make the world
so much better for animals, a kinder world, a gentler world, and along the way, we might
just save ourselves, too. Thank you so much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah. Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea. These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years. Now, orcas are also
known as killer whales. They're profoundly social
and profoundly intelligent beings. And scientists are very interested
in their behavior, because in their social networks,
they share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean. But this pod has been in trouble. The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor
has been way down in the region, and pollution has been up. But on July 24th, Tahlequah
gave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited
by this development. But unfortunately, the same day --
in fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died. Well, what happened next
electrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused
to let her baby slip off into the water. She kept it on her body
and she swam with it. If it did fall off,
she would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this. Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time,
she swam over 1,000 miles. At that point, she let the little baby
slip off into the water. So today, Tahlequah
swims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me. And I do believe that "grief"
is the right word to use. I believe that grief
is the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Because these visible cues,
these behavioral cues, tell us something about
an animal's emotional state. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document
examples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals
and in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality
of animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge
to you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the "a-word." The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically,
it's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So, anthropomorphism is when
we project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions. And we can all probably
think of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, "My cat understands everything I say." Or, "My dog, he's so sweet. he ran right across the yard this morning
towards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play." Well, maybe. Or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different, because we're not trying
to read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them
with some meaning. Now, it's true -- scientists
often push back at me, and they'll say, "Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine
has been disrupted." But I think that this overworry
about anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point. And that is that animals
can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other. And when they do, a survivor's heart
can be pierced by a death. Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out
on embracing part of ourselves. So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world
a better place for animals, a kinder place for animals. So let me tell you a little bit more
about animal grief. I'm going to start in Kenya. You see here there's
an elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed. You see on the left that another female named Grace
came to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet. And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again. At this point, Grace became
visibly distressed, and she prodded the body,
and she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die. What you see on the right is a female
from another family named Maui, who came after the death,
and she stayed at the body. She held a vigil there,
and she even rocked in distress over the body. So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days. And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families. Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe
should be classified as grief. So what does grief look like? It can be rocking, as I said, in distress. It can also be social withdrawal, when an animal just takes
himself or herself away from friends and stays by themselves, or a failure to eat or sleep properly, sometimes a depressed posture
or vocalization. It can be very helpful
for those of us studying this to be able to compare the behavior
of a survivor before death and after death, because that increases the rigor
of our interpretation. And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks
named Harper and Kohl. So we're into birds now. So Harper and Kohl were raised
at a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly. Foie gras does involve
force-feeding of birds. So this hurt their bodies, and their
spirits were not in good shape, either. But thankfully, they were rescued
by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends. They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper
to the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there
for over an hour with his friend. And in the weeks after, he had a hard time. He would go back to that same pond
where he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends. And within two months, he died as well. Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals
have this sorrowful outcome. Last summer, I flew to Boston
to visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie. I really needed a break from work. But I succumbed,
and I checked my work email. You know how that is. And there was a communication
about a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist,
this wasn't what I expected, but there it was, and I'm glad I read it. Because a donkey named Lena
had gone to another farm sanctuary, this one in Alberta, Canada, as the only donkey there, and had trouble making friends
for that reason. But she eventually did make friends
with an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable. But the reason the email came
was that Jake, at age 32, the horse, had become gravely ill
and had to be put down, and this is what was going on. This is Lena standing on Jake's grave. She didn't want to come in at night.
She didn't want to come in for food. She didn't want to come in for water. She pawed at the grave,
she brayed in distress, and there she stood. So we talked and we brainstormed. What do you do for an animal like this? And we talked about the role of time, of extra love and kindness from people and of urging her to make a new friend. And here's where her trajectory does
diverge from that of Harper the duck, because she did make a new friend, and sanctuary workers wrote back
and said it worked out well. Now sometimes, scientists
supplement observation with hormonal analysis. There's an example of a group
of scientists in Botswana, who took fecal material from baboons
and compared two different groups. The first group were females
who had witnessed a predator attack and lost someone in that attack, and the second group were females
who had witnessed an attack but had not lost someone. And the stress hormones
were way up in that first group. But here's the thing: the scientists didn't just
call them "stressed baboons," they called them "bereaved baboons," and in part, that's because
of the observations that they made. For example, this mother-daughter
pair were very close, and then the daughter
was killed by a lion. The mother removed herself
from all her friends, from her grooming networks,
and just stayed by herself for weeks -- bereavement -- and she then slowly recovered. So we have bereaved baboons. Will science tell us someday
about bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason
is because animals really need one-to-one, close relationships
for that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters,
and personality matters. I have documented
cats and dogs who grieve, our companion animals, but I also interacted with a woman
who was extremely bothered because her dog wasn't grieving. She said to me, "The first dog
in the house has died. The second animal does not
seem concerned, the second dog. What is wrong with him?" (Laughter) And as I listened to her, I realized that this dog was now
the only animal in the household, and as far as he was concerned,
that was a pretty good deal. So circumstances matter. Now, in any case, animals
are not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people
we've never met, across space and time. I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean
that their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing, and we can see it if we choose. Now, I've lost both my parents. I lost a very dear friend
at a young age from AIDS. I believe most likely most of you
here have lost someone. And I have found it a genuine comfort, a solace, to know that we aren't
the only beings on this earth who feel love and grief. And I think this is important. I also think we can take
this a step further, and we can realize
that the reality of animal grief can help us be better
and do better for animals. This is already happening with Tahlequah, because the United States and Canada have
renewed their talks with greater urgency for how to help the orcas, how to restore the Chinook salmon and how to help with the water pollution. We can also see that if grief is real, there's tremendous
plausibility to the notion that animals feel a whole range of things. So we could look at joy,
sadness, even hope. And if we do that, here's how we can start
to think about the world. We can look at orcas and say, we know they grieve,
we know they feel their lives, and we can refuse to confine them
to small tanks in theme parks and make them perform
for our entertainment. (Applause) Thank you. We can look at elephants
and say, yes, they grieve, and we can renew our efforts
against international trophy hunting and against poaching. (Applause) Thank you. And we can look at our closest
living relatives, monkeys and apes, and know yes they grieve,
they feel their lives, so they don't deserve to be confined in highly invasive biomedical experiments year after year. And, you know -- (Applause) the ducks Harper and Kohl,
they tell us something too. They help us connect the dots
and realize that what we eat affects how animals live. And it's not just foie gras,
and it's not just ducks. We can think about pigs and chickens
and cows in factory farms, and we can know. I can tell you the science is real
that these animals feel, too. So every single time
we choose a plant-based meal, we are contributing
to reducing animal suffering. (Applause) So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief. I believe in the reality of animal love, and I think it is time for us humans to recognize that
we don't own these things. And when we see that, we have an opportunity to make the world
so much better for animals, a kinder world, a gentler world, and along the way, we might
just save ourselves, too. Thank you so much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
