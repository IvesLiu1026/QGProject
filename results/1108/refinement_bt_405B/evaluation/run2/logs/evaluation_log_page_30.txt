What makes a good horror story? Sure, you could throw 
in some hideous monsters, fountains of blood, and things jumping out from every corner, but as classic horror author
H.P. Lovecraft wrote, "The oldest and strongest
kind of fear is fear of the unknown." And writers harness that fear
not by revealing horrors, but by leaving the audience hanging
in anticipation of them. That is, in a state of suspense. The most familiar examples of suspense
come from horror films and mystery novels. What's inside the haunted mansion? Which of the dinner guests 
is the murderer? But suspense exists beyond these genres. Will the hero save the day? Will the couple get together
in the end? And what is the dark secret that causes
the main character so much pain? The key to suspense is that it sets up
a question, or several, that the audience hopes 
to get an answer to and delays that answer while maintaining
their interest and keeping them guessing. So what are some techniques you can use
to achieve this in your own writing? Limit the point of view. Instead of an omniscient narrator who can
see and relay everything that happens, tell the story from the perspective
of the characters. They may start off knowing just
as little as the audience does, and as they learn more, so do we. Classic novels, like "Dracula," for example,
are told through letters and diary entries where characters relate
what they've experienced and fear what's to come. Next, choose the right setting 
and imagery. Old mansions or castles with winding
halls and secret passageways suggest that disturbing things
are being concealed. Nighttime, fog, and storms all play
similar roles in limiting visibility and restricting characters' movements. That's why Victorian London is such
a popular setting. And even ordinary places and objects
can be made sinister as in the Gothic novel "Rebecca" where the flowers at the protagonist's
new home are described as blood red. Three: play with style and form. You can build suspense by carefully
paying attention not just to what happens but how it's conveyed and paced. Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state
of the narrator in "The Tell-Tale Heart" with fragmented sentences
that break off suddenly. And other short declarative sentences
in the story create a mix of breathless speed
and weighty pauses. On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's
cinematography is known for its use of extended
silences and shots of staircases to create a feeling of discomfort. Four: use dramatic irony. You can't just keep the audience
in the dark forever. Sometimes, suspense is best served by revealing key parts of the big secret
to the audience but not to the characters. This is a technique known 
as dramatic irony, where the mystery becomes
not what will happen but when and how 
the characters will learn. In the classic play "Oedipus Rex," the title character is unaware
that he has killed his own father and married his mother. But the audience knows, and watching
Oedipus gradually learn the truth provides the story 
with its agonizing climax. And finally, the cliffhanger. Beware of overusing this one. Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,
but it's hard to deny its effectiveness. This is where a chapter, episode,
volume, or season cuts off right before something
crucial is revealed, or in the midst of a dangerous situation
with a slim chance of hope. The wait, whether moments or years, makes us imagine possibilities about
what could happen next, building extra suspense. The awful thing is almost always averted, creating a sense of closure 
and emotional release. But that doesn't stop us from worrying
and wondering the next time the protagonists face 
near-certain disaster.

**Transcript**:
What makes a good horror story? Sure, you could throw 
in some hideous monsters, fountains of blood, and things jumping out from every corner, but as classic horror author
H.P. Lovecraft wrote, "The oldest and strongest
kind of fear is fear of the unknown." And writers harness that fear
not by revealing horrors, but by leaving the audience hanging
in anticipation of them. That is, in a state of suspense. The most familiar examples of suspense
come from horror films and mystery novels. What's inside the haunted mansion? Which of the dinner guests 
is the murderer? But suspense exists beyond these genres. Will the hero save the day? Will the couple get together
in the end? And what is the dark secret that causes
the main character so much pain? The key to suspense is that it sets up
a question, or several, that the audience hopes 
to get an answer to and delays that answer while maintaining
their interest and keeping them guessing. So what are some techniques you can use
to achieve this in your own writing? Limit the point of view. Instead of an omniscient narrator who can
see and relay everything that happens, tell the story from the perspective
of the characters. They may start off knowing just
as little as the audience does, and as they learn more, so do we. Classic novels, like "Dracula," for example,
are told through letters and diary entries where characters relate
what they've experienced and fear what's to come. Next, choose the right setting 
and imagery. Old mansions or castles with winding
halls and secret passageways suggest that disturbing things
are being concealed. Nighttime, fog, and storms all play
similar roles in limiting visibility and restricting characters' movements. That's why Victorian London is such
a popular setting. And even ordinary places and objects
can be made sinister as in the Gothic novel "Rebecca" where the flowers at the protagonist's
new home are described as blood red. Three: play with style and form. You can build suspense by carefully
paying attention not just to what happens but how it's conveyed and paced. Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state
of the narrator in "The Tell-Tale Heart" with fragmented sentences
that break off suddenly. And other short declarative sentences
in the story create a mix of breathless speed
and weighty pauses. On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's
cinematography is known for its use of extended
silences and shots of staircases to create a feeling of discomfort. Four: use dramatic irony. You can't just keep the audience
in the dark forever. Sometimes, suspense is best served by revealing key parts of the big secret
to the audience but not to the characters. This is a technique known 
as dramatic irony, where the mystery becomes
not what will happen but when and how 
the characters will learn. In the classic play "Oedipus Rex," the title character is unaware
that he has killed his own father and married his mother. But the audience knows, and watching
Oedipus gradually learn the truth provides the story 
with its agonizing climax. And finally, the cliffhanger. Beware of overusing this one. Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,
but it's hard to deny its effectiveness. This is where a chapter, episode,
volume, or season cuts off right before something
crucial is revealed, or in the midst of a dangerous situation
with a slim chance of hope. The wait, whether moments or years, makes us imagine possibilities about
what could happen next, building extra suspense. The awful thing is almost always averted, creating a sense of closure 
and emotional release. But that doesn't stop us from worrying
and wondering the next time the protagonists face 
near-certain disaster.

**Transcript**:
James Joyce's "Ulysses" is widely considered
to be both a literary masterpiece and one of the hardest works
of literature to read. It inspires such devotion that once a year
on a day called Bloomsday, thousands of people all over the world
dress up like the characters, take to the streets, and read the book aloud. And some even make a pilgrimage
to Dublin just to visit the places so vividly
depicted in Joyce's opus. So what is it about this famously
difficult novel that inspires so many people? There's no one simple answer
to that question, but there are a few remarkable things
about the book that keep people coming back. The plot, which transpires over
the course of a single day, is a story of three characters: Stephen Dedalus, reprised from 
Joyce's earlier novel, "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"; Leopold Bloom, a half-Jewish advertising
canvasser for a Dublin newspaper; and Bloom's wife Molly, who is about
to embark on an affair. Stephen is depressed because
of his mother's recent death. Meanwhile, Bloom wanders 
throughout the city. He goes to a funeral, his work, a pub, and so on, avoiding going home because Molly
is about to begin her affair. Where it really starts 
to get interesting, though, is how the story's told. Each chapter is written 
in a different style. 15 is a play, 13 is like a cheesy romance novel, 12 is a story with bizarre,
exaggerated interruptions, 11 uses techniques, like onomatopoeia,
repetitions, and alliteration to imitate music, and 14 reproduces the evolution
of English literary prose style, from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon
right up to the 20th century. That all culminates in the final chapter which follows Molly's 
stream of consciousness as it spools out in just 
eight long paragraphs with almost no punctuation. The range of styles
Joyce uses in "Ulysses" is one of the things 
that makes it so difficult, but it also helps make it enjoyable. And it's one of the reasons that
the book is held up as one of the key texts 
of literary modernism, a movement characterized by overturning
traditional modes of writing. Joyce fills his narrative 
gymnastic routines with some of the most imaginative 
use of language you'll find anywhere. Take, for instance, "The figure seated on a large boulder 
at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested 
stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed 
largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged
ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero." Here, Joyce exaggerates the description
of a mangy old man in a pub to make him seem like an improbably
gigantesque hero. It's true that some sections 
are impenetrably dense at first glance, but it's up to the reader 
to let their eyes skim over them or break out a shovel and dig in. And once you start excavating the text, you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic
treasure trove. It's filled with all manner of references
and allusions from medieval philosophy
to the symbolism of tattoos, and from Dante to Dublin slang. As suggested by the title, some of these
allusions revolve around Homer's "Odyssey." Each chapter is named after a character
or episode from the "Odyssey," but the literary references are often
coy, debatable, sarcastic, or disguised. For example, Homer's Odysseus,
after an epic 20-year-long journey, returns home to Ithaca
and reunites with his faithful wife. In contrast, Joyce's Bloom
wanders around Dublin for a day and returns home to his unfaithful wife. It's a very funny book. It has highbrow intellectual humor, if you have the patience to track down
Joyce's references, and more lowbrow dirty jokes. Those, and other sexual references,
were too much for some. In the U.S., the book was put on trial,
banned, and censored before it had even been completed because it was originally published
as a serial novel. Readers of "Ulysses" aren't just led
through a variety of literary styles. They're also given a rich 
and shockingly accurate tour of a specific place at a time: Dublin in 1904. Joyce claimed that if Dublin
were to be destroyed, it could be recreated from the pages
of this book. While such a claim is not exactly true, it does show the great care that Joyce
took in precisely representing details, both large and small, of his home city. No small feat considering he wrote
the entire novel while living outside 
of his native Ireland. It's a testament to Joyce's genius
that "Ulysses" is a difficult book. Some people find it impenetrable
without a full book of annotations to help them understand what Joyce
is even talking about. But there's a lot of joy to be found
in reading it, more than just unpacking allusions
and solving puzzles. And if it's difficult, 
or frustrating, or funny, that's because life is all that, and more. Responding to some criticism
of "Ulysses," and there was a lot 
when it was first published, Joyce said that if "Ulysses"
isn't worth reading, then life isn't worth living.

to get interesting, though, is how the story's told. Each chapter is written 
in a different style. 15 is a play, 13 is like a cheesy romance novel, 12 is a story with bizarre,
exaggerated interruptions, 11 uses techniques, like onomatopoeia,
repetitions, and alliteration to imitate music, and 14 reproduces the evolution
of English literary prose style, from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon
right up to the 20th century. That all culminates in the final chapter which follows Molly's 
stream of consciousness as it spools out in just 
eight long paragraphs with almost no punctuation. The range of styles
Joyce uses in "Ulysses" is one of the things 
that makes it so difficult, but it also helps make it enjoyable. And it's one of the reasons that
the book is held up as one of the key texts 
of literary modernism, a movement characterized by overturning
traditional modes of writing. Joyce fills his narrative 
gymnastic routines with some of the most imaginative 
use of language you'll find anywhere. Take, for instance, "The figure seated on a large boulder 
at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested 
stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed 
largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged
ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero." Here, Joyce exaggerates the description
of a mangy old man in a pub to make him seem like an improbably
gigantesque hero. It's true that some sections 
are impenetrably dense at first glance, but it's up to the reader 
to let their eyes skim over them or break out a shovel and dig in. And once you start excavating the text, you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic
treasure trove. It's filled with all manner of references
and allusions from medieval philosophy
to the symbolism of tattoos, and from Dante to Dublin slang. As suggested by the title, some of these
allusions revolve around Homer's "Odyssey." Each chapter is named after a character
or episode from the "Odyssey," but the literary references are often
coy, debatable, sarcastic, or disguised. For example, Homer's Odysseus,
after an epic 20-year-long journey, returns home to Ithaca
and reunites with his faithful wife. In contrast, Joyce's Bloom
wanders around Dublin for a day and returns home to his unfaithful wife. It's a very funny book. It has highbrow intellectual humor, if you have the patience to track down
Joyce's references, and more lowbrow dirty jokes. Those, and other sexual references,
were too much for some. In the U.S., the book was put on trial,
banned, and censored before it had even been completed because it was originally published
as a serial novel. Readers of "Ulysses" aren't just led
through a variety of literary styles. They're also given a rich 
and shockingly accurate tour of a specific place at a time: Dublin in 1904. Joyce claimed that if Dublin
were to be destroyed, it could be recreated from the pages
of this book. While such a claim is not exactly true, it does show the great care that Joyce
took in precisely representing details, both large and small, of his home city. No small feat considering he wrote
the entire novel while living outside 
of his native Ireland. It's a testament to Joyce's genius
that "Ulysses" is a difficult book. Some people find it impenetrable
without a full book of annotations to help them understand what Joyce
is even talking about. But there's a lot of joy to be found
in reading it, more than just unpacking allusions
and solving puzzles. And if it's difficult, 
or frustrating, or funny, that's because life is all that, and more. Responding to some criticism
of "Ulysses," and there was a lot 
when it was first published, Joyce said that if "Ulysses"
isn't worth reading, then life isn't worth living.

**Transcript**:
James Joyce's "Ulysses" is widely considered
to be both a literary masterpiece and one of the hardest works
of literature to read. It inspires such devotion that once a year
on a day called Bloomsday, thousands of people all over the world
dress up like the characters, take to the streets, and read the book aloud. And some even make a pilgrimage
to Dublin just to visit the places so vividly
depicted in Joyce's opus. So what is it about this famously
difficult novel that inspires so many people? There's no one simple answer
to that question, but there are a few remarkable things
about the book that keep people coming back. The plot, which transpires over
the course of a single day, is a story of three characters: Stephen Dedalus, reprised from 
Joyce's earlier novel, "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"; Leopold Bloom, a half-Jewish advertising
canvasser for a Dublin newspaper; and Bloom's wife Molly, who is about
to embark on an affair. Stephen is depressed because
of his mother's recent death. Meanwhile, Bloom wanders 
throughout the city. He goes to a funeral, his work, a pub, and so on, avoiding going home because Molly
is about to begin her affair. Where it really starts 
to get interesting, though, is how the story's told. Each chapter is written

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the year in which Ulysses is set. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 1 mentions "thousands of people worldwide celebrate James Joyce's novel 'Ulysses'" on a specific day called Bloomsday. According to the transcript, this celebration is related to the events in the book, which occur on a single day in Dublin. However, this does not directly answer the question about the year.

A more relevant generated MCQ is not available. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

However, I can propose a new generated MCQ that would match the ground truth MCQ:

Question: In what year is the story of Ulysses set?
Options: A. 1904, B. 1914, C. 1922, D. 1882
Correct Option: A

This new generated MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ. Since this is not among the original generated MCQs, I will not provide an index.

**Transcript**:
What if electricity could travel forever
without being diminished? What if a computer could run exponentially
faster with perfect accuracy? What technology could 
those abilities build? We may be able to find out thanks 
to the work of the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize 
in Physics in 2016. David Thouless, Duncan Haldane, and Michael Kosterlitz won the award
for discovering that even microscopic matter
at the smallest scale can exhibit macroscopic properties
and phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch
of mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties
of objects. Topological properties don't change when
an object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached
in new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same
to a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut 
into a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand, 
a pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes
that will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear
whether topology was useful for describing the behaviors
of subatomic particles. That's because particles,
like electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws
of quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see 
at the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered
that topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize
materials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties
lend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics
to some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called 
a topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field
passes through them, each electron will start traveling
in a circle, which is called
a closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck
in these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected,
and they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump
from one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material
conducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected
by small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole
in the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator
has perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways
can even be controlled. The electronics of the future 
could be built to use this perfectly efficient
electron highway. The topological properties 
of subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers 
take advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be 
in different states at the same time to store information in something
called qubits. These qubits can solve problems
exponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data
is so delicate that interaction with the environment

What if electricity could travel forever
without being diminished? What if a computer could run exponentially
faster with perfect accuracy? What technology could 
those abilities build? We may be able to find out thanks 
to the work of the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize 
in Physics in 2016. David Thouless, Duncan Haldane, and Michael Kosterlitz won the award
for discovering that even microscopic matter
at the smallest scale can exhibit macroscopic properties
and phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch
of mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties
of objects. Topological properties don't change when
an object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached
in new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same
to a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut 
into a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand, 
a pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes
that will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear
whether topology was useful for describing the behaviors
of subatomic particles. That's because particles,
like electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws
of quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see 
at the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered
that topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize
materials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties
lend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics
to some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called 
a topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field
passes through them, each electron will start traveling
in a circle, which is called
a closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck
in these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected,
and they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump
from one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material
conducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected
by small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole
in the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator
has perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways
can even be controlled. The electronics of the future 
could be built to use this perfectly efficient
electron highway. The topological properties 
of subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers 
take advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be 
in different states at the same time to store information in something
called qubits. These qubits can solve problems
exponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data
is so delicate that interaction with the environment
can destroy it. But in some exotic topological phases, the subatomic particles 
can become protected. In other words, the qubits formed by them can't be changed by small 
or local disturbances. These topological qubits 
would be more stable, leading to more accurate computation
and a better quantum computer. Topology was originally studied as
a branch of purely abstract mathematics. Thanks to the pioneering work

without being diminished? What if a computer could run exponentially
faster with perfect accuracy? What technology could 
those abilities build? We may be able to find out thanks 
to the work of the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize 
in Physics in 2016. David Thouless, Duncan Haldane, and Michael Kosterlitz won the award
for discovering that even microscopic matter
at the smallest scale can exhibit macroscopic properties
and phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch
of mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties
of objects. Topological properties don't change when
an object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached
in new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same
to a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut 
into a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand, 
a pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes
that will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear
whether topology was useful for describing the behaviors
of subatomic particles. That's because particles,
like electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws
of quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see 
at the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered
that topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize
materials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties
lend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics
to some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called 
a topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field
passes through them, each electron will start traveling
in a circle, which is called
a closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck
in these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected,
and they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump
from one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material
conducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected
by small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole
in the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator
has perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways
can even be controlled. The electronics of the future 
could be built to use this perfectly efficient
electron highway. The topological properties 
of subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers 
take advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be 
in different states at the same time to store information in something
called qubits. These qubits can solve problems
exponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data
is so delicate that interaction with the environment
can destroy it. But in some exotic topological phases, the subatomic particles 
can become protected. In other words, the qubits formed by them can't be changed by small 
or local disturbances. These topological qubits 
would be more stable, leading to more accurate computation
and a better quantum computer. Topology was originally studied as
a branch of purely abstract mathematics. Thanks to the pioneering work
of Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz, we now know it can be used to understand
the riddles of nature and to revolutionize 
the future of technologies.

**Transcript**:
In 19 B.C., the Roman poet Virgil
was traveling from Greece to Rome with the emperor Augustus. On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing
in Megara, a town in Greece. Out in the sun for too long,
he suffered heatstroke and died on his journey back to Italy. On his deathbed, Virgil thought about the manuscript 
he had been working on for over ten years, an epic poem that he called the "Aeneid." Unsatisfied with the final edit,
he asked his friends to burn it, but they refused, and soon after Virgil's death,
Augustus ordered it to be published. Why was Augustus so interested
in saving Virgil's poem? The Romans had little tradition
of writing serious literature and Virgil wanted to create a poem to rival the "Iliad"
and "Odyssey" of Ancient Greece. The "Aeneid," a 9,896 line poem,
spans twelve separate sections, or books, the first six of which mirror
the structure of the "Odyssey" and the last six echo the "Iliad." Also like the Greek epics, The "Aeneid" is written entirely
in dactylic hexameter. In this meter, each line 
has six syllable groups called feet made up of dactyls which go
long, short, short, and spondees which go long, long. So the famous opening line
in the original Latin starts, "Arma Virvmqve Cano," which can be translated as
"I sing of arms and the man," arms, meaning battles and warfare,
another "Iliad" reference, and the man being the hero Aeneas. To understand the "Aeneid," it's necessary to examine the unsettled
nature of Roman politics in the second half of the 1st century B.C. In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar, 
Augustus's great uncle, triggered nearly 20 years of civil war when he led his army 
against the Roman Republic. After introducing a dictatorship,
he was assassinated. Only after Augustus's victory
over Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C. did peace return to Rome and Augustus became the emperor. Virgil aimed to capture this sense
of a new era and of the great sacrifices
that the Romans had endured. He wanted to give the Romans
a fresh sense of their origins, their past, and their potential. By connecting the founding of Rome to the mythological stories
that his audience knew so well, Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas
to the character of Augustus. In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest
to establish a new home for his people. This duty, or pietas 
as the Romans called it, faces all kinds of obstacles. Aeneas risks destruction 
in the ruins of Troy, agonizes over love when he meets
the beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido, and in one of the most vivid passages
in all of ancient literature, has to pass through the underworld. On top of all that, he must then
fight to win a homeland for his people around the future sight of Rome. Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model
for Augustus, and that's probably one of the reasons
the emperor was so eager to save the poem from destruction. But Virgil didn't stop there. In some sections, Aeneas even has visions
of Rome's future and of Augustus himself. Virgil presents Augustus as a victor,
entering Rome in triumph and shows him expanding 
the Roman Empire. Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as
only the third Roman leader in 700 years to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus
signifying the arrival of permanent peace. But there's a twist. Virgil only read Augustus three
selected extracts of the story and that was Augustus's 
entire exposure to it. Some of the other sections
could be seen as critical, if not subtly subversive
about the emperor's achievements. Aeneas, again a model for Augustus,
struggles with his duty and often seems a reluctant hero. He doesn't always live up to the
behavior expected of a good Roman leader. He struggles to balance mercy and justice. By the end, the reader is left wondering
about the future of Rome and the new government of Augustus. Perhaps in wanting the story published, Augustus had been fooled
by his own desire for self-promotion. As a result, Virgil's story has survived
to ask questions about the nature of power
and authority ever since.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What is the name of the hero in Virgil's epic poem, the "Aeneid"? Options: A. Augustus, B. Aeneas, C. Julius Caesar, D. Marc Antony Correct Option: B.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the hero of the poem, not the Roman emperor when Virgil was writing the "Aeneid". 

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the Roman emperor during the time the "Aeneid" was written. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

That being said, if we had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, Question 6: How does Virgil present Augustus in some sections of the poem? Options: A. As a villain, B. As a reluctant hero, C. As a victor, entering Rome in triumph, D. As a weak leader Correct Option: C, is a better match in terms of mentioning Augustus, but it still doesn't directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

Given the options, the closest match would be Question 4 or Question 6. However, since neither of these questions perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be more accurate to say that there is no ideal match among the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose, I would say Question 6 is the closest match, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
In 19 B.C., the Roman poet Virgil
was traveling from Greece to Rome with the emperor Augustus. On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing
in Megara, a town in Greece. Out in the sun for too long,
he suffered heatstroke and died on his journey back to Italy. On his deathbed, Virgil thought about the manuscript 
he had been working on for over ten years, an epic poem that he called the "Aeneid." Unsatisfied with the final edit,
he asked his friends to burn it, but they refused, and soon after Virgil's death,
Augustus ordered it to be published. Why was Augustus so interested
in saving Virgil's poem? The Romans had little tradition
of writing serious literature and Virgil wanted to create a poem to rival the "Iliad"
and "Odyssey" of Ancient Greece. The "Aeneid," a 9,896 line poem,
spans twelve separate sections, or books, the first six of which mirror
the structure of the "Odyssey" and the last six echo the "Iliad." Also like the Greek epics, The "Aeneid" is written entirely
in dactylic hexameter. In this meter, each line 
has six syllable groups called feet made up of dactyls which go
long, short, short, and spondees which go long, long. So the famous opening line
in the original Latin starts, "Arma Virvmqve Cano," which can be translated as
"I sing of arms and the man," arms, meaning battles and warfare,
another "Iliad" reference, and the man being the hero Aeneas. To understand the "Aeneid," it's necessary to examine the unsettled
nature of Roman politics in the second half of the 1st century B.C. In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar, 
Augustus's great uncle, triggered nearly 20 years of civil war when he led his army 
against the Roman Republic. After introducing a dictatorship,
he was assassinated. Only after Augustus's victory
over Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C. did peace return to Rome and Augustus became the emperor. Virgil aimed to capture this sense
of a new era and of the great sacrifices
that the Romans had endured. He wanted to give the Romans
a fresh sense of their origins, their past, and their potential. By connecting the founding of Rome to the mythological stories
that his audience knew so well, Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas
to the character of Augustus. In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest
to establish a new home for his people. This duty, or pietas 
as the Romans called it, faces all kinds of obstacles. Aeneas risks destruction 
in the ruins of Troy, agonizes over love when he meets
the beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido, and in one of the most vivid passages
in all of ancient literature, has to pass through the underworld. On top of all that, he must then
fight to win a homeland for his people around the future sight of Rome. Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model
for Augustus, and that's probably one of the reasons
the emperor was so eager to save the poem from destruction. But Virgil didn't stop there. In some sections, Aeneas even has visions
of Rome's future and of Augustus himself. Virgil presents Augustus as a victor,
entering Rome in triumph and shows him expanding 
the Roman Empire. Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as
only the third Roman leader in 700 years to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus
signifying the arrival of permanent peace. But there's a twist. Virgil only read Augustus three
selected extracts of the story and that was Augustus's 
entire exposure to it. Some of the other sections
could be seen as critical, if not subtly subversive
about the emperor's achievements. Aeneas, again a model for Augustus,
struggles with his duty and often seems a reluctant hero. He doesn't always live up to the
behavior expected of a good Roman leader. He struggles to balance mercy and justice. By the end, the reader is left wondering
about the future of Rome and the new government of Augustus. Perhaps in wanting the story published, Augustus had been fooled
by his own desire for self-promotion. As a result, Virgil's story has survived
to ask questions about the nature of power
and authority ever since.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 4: "What is the name of the hero in Virgil's epic poem, the 'Aeneid'?" is the closest match.

Although it doesn't directly ask about the type of work the "Aeneid" is, it does imply that the "Aeneid" is an epic poem, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that could be a direct match in terms of intent, I would say that a new question could be created based on the content of Question 2: "What was the primary reason Augustus was interested in saving Virgil's poem, the 'Aeneid'?" 

One of the options in this question could be modified to ask directly about the type of work the "Aeneid" is, as seen in the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one of the existing questions, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Imagine setting sail 
from Hawaii in a canoe. Your target is a small island thousands
of kilometers away in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's a body of water that covers
more than 160 million square kilometers, greater than all the landmasses 
on Earth combined. For thousands of years, Polynesian navigators managed voyages 
like this without the help 
of modern navigational aids. Ancient Polynesians used the Sun, Moon, stars, planets, ocean currents, and clouds as guides that allowed them
to see the ocean as a series of pathways rather than an obstacle. Their voyages began around 1500 B.C. when the people who would settle Polynesia
first set sail from Southeast Asia. Early Polynesians eventually settled
a vast area of islands spread over 40 million square kilometers
of the Pacific Ocean. Some historians believe the voyagers moved
from place to place to avoid overpopulation. Others, that they were driven by war. Voyages became less frequent
by around 1300 A.D. as Polynesian societies became more rooted
in specific locations. During the voyaging period, successful journeys depended on 
a number of factors: well-built canoes, the skill of navigators, and weather being some of the biggest. Voyages relied on sturdy wa'a kaulua,
or double-hulled canoes, which were powered by sails
and steered with a single large oar. Canoe building involved
the whole community, bringing together the navigators, canoe builders, priests, chanters, and hula dancers. Navigators were keen observers 
of the natural world. They were abundantly familiar with 
trade wind-generated ocean swells, which typically flow 
northeast or southeast. By day, navigators could 
identify direction by the rocking motion of their canoes
caused by these swells. But sunrise and sunset 
were even more useful. The Sun's position indicated east and west and created low light on the ocean that
made it possible to see swells directly. At night, navigators used something 
called a star compass, which wasn't a physical object,
but rather a sort of mental map. They memorized the rising and setting
points of stars and constellations at different times of the year. They used those to divide the sky
into four quadrants, subdivided into 32 houses, with the canoe in the middle. So, for example, when they saw the star
Pira‘atea rising from the ocean, they knew that to be northeast. They had some other tricks, too. The Earth's axis points towards Hokupa'a,
or the North Star, so called because it's the one fixed
point in the sky as the Earth rotates and always indicates north. However, it's not visible 
south of the Equator, so navigators there could use
a constellation called Newe, or the Southern Cross, and some mental tricks to estimate
where south is. For instance, draw a line through
these two stars, extend it 4.5 times, and draw another line 
from there to the horizon. That's south. But the sky also contains 
navigational aids much closer to Earth, the clouds. Besides being useful weather cues, under the right conditions, 
they can indicate landmasses. For instance, the lagoons 
of Pacific atolls can actually be seen reflected
on the underside of clouds, if you know what to look for. And high masses of clouds can indicate
mountainous islands. Once navigators neared their destination,
other clues, such as the flight patterns of birds, floating debris or vegetation, and types of fish in the area helped
determine the proximity of land. For example, the Manu-O-Ku had a known
flight range of 190 kilometers, and could be followed back to shore. So how do we know all of this? Partially through evidence in petroglyphs, written observations 
of European explorers, and Polynesian oral traditions. But also by trying them out for ourselves. In 2017, a voyaging canoe called Hokulea completed a worldwide voyage 
using only these techniques. If that seems remarkable,
remember the ancient Polynesians, who through close study 
and kinship with nature, were able to forge these paths across an unfathomably vast, 
vibrant living ocean.

**Transcript**:
Imagine setting sail 
from Hawaii in a canoe. Your target is a small island thousands
of kilometers away in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's a body of water that covers
more than 160 million square kilometers, greater than all the landmasses 
on Earth combined. For thousands of years, Polynesian navigators managed voyages 
like this without the help 
of modern navigational aids. Ancient Polynesians used the Sun, Moon, stars, planets, ocean currents, and clouds as guides that allowed them
to see the ocean as a series of pathways rather than an obstacle. Their voyages began around 1500 B.C. when the people who would settle Polynesia
first set sail from Southeast Asia. Early Polynesians eventually settled
a vast area of islands spread over 40 million square kilometers
of the Pacific Ocean. Some historians believe the voyagers moved
from place to place to avoid overpopulation. Others, that they were driven by war. Voyages became less frequent
by around 1300 A.D. as Polynesian societies became more rooted
in specific locations. During the voyaging period, successful journeys depended on 
a number of factors: well-built canoes, the skill of navigators, and weather being some of the biggest. Voyages relied on sturdy wa'a kaulua,
or double-hulled canoes, which were powered by sails
and steered with a single large oar. Canoe building involved
the whole community, bringing together the navigators, canoe builders, priests, chanters, and hula dancers. Navigators were keen observers 
of the natural world. They were abundantly familiar with 
trade wind-generated ocean swells, which typically flow 
northeast or southeast. By day, navigators could 
identify direction by the rocking motion of their canoes
caused by these swells. But sunrise and sunset 
were even more useful. The Sun's position indicated east and west and created low light on the ocean that
made it possible to see swells directly. At night, navigators used something 
called a star compass, which wasn't a physical object,
but rather a sort of mental map. They memorized the rising and setting
points of stars and constellations at different times of the year. They used those to divide the sky
into four quadrants, subdivided into 32 houses, with the canoe in the middle. So, for example, when they saw the star
Pira‘atea rising from the ocean, they knew that to be northeast. They had some other tricks, too. The Earth's axis points towards Hokupa'a,
or the North Star, so called because it's the one fixed
point in the sky as the Earth rotates and always indicates north. However, it's not visible 
south of the Equator, so navigators there could use
a constellation called Newe, or the Southern Cross, and some mental tricks to estimate
where south is. For instance, draw a line through
these two stars, extend it 4.5 times, and draw another line 
from there to the horizon. That's south. But the sky also contains 
navigational aids much closer to Earth, the clouds. Besides being useful weather cues, under the right conditions, 
they can indicate landmasses. For instance, the lagoons 
of Pacific atolls can actually be seen reflected
on the underside of clouds, if you know what to look for. And high masses of clouds can indicate
mountainous islands. Once navigators neared their destination,
other clues, such as the flight patterns of birds, floating debris or vegetation, and types of fish in the area helped
determine the proximity of land. For example, the Manu-O-Ku had a known
flight range of 190 kilometers, and could be followed back to shore. So how do we know all of this? Partially through evidence in petroglyphs, written observations 
of European explorers, and Polynesian oral traditions. But also by trying them out for ourselves. In 2017, a voyaging canoe called Hokulea completed a worldwide voyage 
using only these techniques. If that seems remarkable,
remember the ancient Polynesians, who through close study 
and kinship with nature, were able to forge these paths across an unfathomably vast, 
vibrant living ocean.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the most valued aspect in canoe building, and the correct option is "The bringing together of the community." While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions "well-built canoes" as one of the key factors that contributed to the success of Polynesian voyages. Although it doesn't specifically ask about the most valued aspect in canoe building, it does relate to the importance of canoes in Polynesian voyages.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to community involvement, I would suggest Question 9, which asks about the relationship between the Polynesian people and the natural world. While it doesn't directly ask about canoe building, it does mention the close and kinship-based relationship between the Polynesian people and nature, which is somewhat related to the community aspect.

That being said, I must emphasize that there isn't a direct match between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs. If I had to choose an index, I would suggest Question 9 (index 9), but please note that it's not a perfect match.

Index: 9 (partial match)

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the validation of ancient Polynesian navigational techniques. The ground truth MCQ asks how we know these methods worked, while Question 8 asks about a specific example of these methods being used successfully in a modern context. The correct options for both questions (A for the ground truth MCQ and B for Question 8) both reference the use of traditional techniques and evidence to support their effectiveness.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9's companion, Question 10, or even Question 9 itself, but more so Question 10's option B and the correct option of the ground truth MCQ both highlight the idea that these ancient methods have been proven effective through practice and evidence.

But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 8 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
On the night of January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, 
a priest in Palermo, Italy, was mapping the stars in the sky. Over three nights, he'd look at and draw
the same set of stars, carefully measuring 
their relative positions. That night, he measured the stars. The next night, he measured them again. To his surprise, one had moved. The third night, the peculiar star
had moved again. This meant it couldn't be a star at all. It was something new, the first asteroid
ever discovered, which Piazzi eventually named Ceres. Asteroids are bits of rock and metal
that orbit the Sun. At over 900 kilometers across,
Ceres is a very large asteroid. But through a telescope, like Piazzi's, Ceres looked like a pinpoint of light
similar to a star. In fact, the word asteroid 
means star-like. You can tell the difference between stars and asteroids by 
the way they move across the sky. Of course, Piazzi knew 
none of that at the time, just that he had discovered something new. To learn about Ceres, Piazzi needed to track 
its motion across the sky and then calculate 
its orbit around the Sun. So each clear night, Piazzi
trained his telescope to the heavens. Night after night, 
he made careful measurements until finally, he couldn't. The Sun got in the way. When Piazzi first spotted Ceres,
it was here, and the Earth was here. As he tracked it each night,
the Earth and Ceres moved like this until Ceres was here. And that meant that Ceres was only
in the sky when it was daytime on Earth. During the day, bright sunlight made 
this small asteroid impossible to see. Astronomers needed to calculate
Ceres's orbit. This would let them predict where
it was going to be in the vast night sky on any given night. But the calculations were grueling
and the results imprecise. Many astronomers searched for Ceres, but not knowing exactly where to look,
no one could find it. Luckily, a hardworking mathematician
named Carl Friedrich Gauss heard about the lost asteroid. He thought it was an exciting puzzle
and went to work. When he realized he didn't have
the mathematical methods he needed, he invented new ones 
that we still use today. He derived a new orbit and new predictions
of where to look for Ceres. Hungarian astronomer
Baron Franz Xaver von Zach searched for Ceres 
with Gauss's predictions. After weeks of frustrating clouds, von Zach finally had clear skies
on December 31, 1801. He looked through his telescope
and finally saw Ceres. We haven't lost track of it since. Today, we've discovered hundreds
of thousands of asteroids. Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun
between Mars and Jupiter, while near-Earth asteroids orbit
the Sun relatively close to Earth. When we recorded this narration, astronomers had discovered 
16,407 near-Earth asteroids, but since we find 
new asteroids all the time, that number will have grown
by hundreds or thousands by the time you watch this. Today, asteroid hunters 
use modern telescopes, including one in space. Computers analyze the images, and humans check the output before reporting the asteroid observations
to an archiving center. Each discovered asteroid has its unique
orbit measured. An orbit lets astronomers predict 
where asteroids are going to be at any given time. Most asteroid trajectories can be
predicted for about 80 years though we can calculate where the best
studied asteroids will be every day between now and 
800 years into the future. We must keep searching for asteroids in case there's one out there
on a collision course with Earth. Astronomers don't only 
search for asteroids, though. They also study them 
to learn how they formed, what they're made of, and what they can tell us 
about our solar system. Today, we can do something that Piazzi
could only dream of: send spacecraft to study 
asteroids up close. One spacecraft called Dawn
journeyed billions of kilometers over four years to the main asteroid belt. There, it visited Ceres
and another asteroid, Vesta. Dawn's stunning images transformed
Piazzi's dot of light into a spectacular landscape
of craters, landslides, and mountains.

On the night of January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, 
a priest in Palermo, Italy, was mapping the stars in the sky. Over three nights, he'd look at and draw
the same set of stars, carefully measuring 
their relative positions. That night, he measured the stars. The next night, he measured them again. To his surprise, one had moved. The third night, the peculiar star
had moved again. This meant it couldn't be a star at all. It was something new, the first asteroid
ever discovered, which Piazzi eventually named Ceres. Asteroids are bits of rock and metal
that orbit the Sun. At over 900 kilometers across,

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of near-Earth asteroids discovered at the time of the narration. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 6 mentions the location of many asteroids, including Ceres, and Question 8 mentions the importance of searching for asteroids. However, these questions do not match the ground truth MCQ.

Since there is no direct match, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ. Instead, I suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of near-Earth asteroids discovered, with options similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If you would like, I can help you create a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

Baron Franz Xaver von Zach searched for Ceres 
with Gauss's predictions. After weeks of frustrating clouds, von Zach finally had clear skies
on December 31, 1801. He looked through his telescope
and finally saw Ceres. We haven't lost track of it since. Today, we've discovered hundreds
of thousands of asteroids. Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun
between Mars and Jupiter, while near-Earth asteroids orbit
the Sun relatively close to Earth. When we recorded this narration, astronomers had discovered 
16,407 near-Earth asteroids, but since we find 
new asteroids all the time, that number will have grown
by hundreds or thousands by the time you watch this. Today, asteroid hunters 
use modern telescopes, including one in space. Computers analyze the images, and humans check the output before reporting the asteroid observations
to an archiving center. Each discovered asteroid has its unique
orbit measured. An orbit lets astronomers predict 
where asteroids are going to be at any given time. Most asteroid trajectories can be
predicted for about 80 years though we can calculate where the best
studied asteroids will be every day between now and 
800 years into the future. We must keep searching for asteroids in case there's one out there
on a collision course with Earth. Astronomers don't only 
search for asteroids, though. They also study them 
to learn how they formed, what they're made of, and what they can tell us 
about our solar system. Today, we can do something that Piazzi
could only dream of: send spacecraft to study 
asteroids up close. One spacecraft called Dawn
journeyed billions of kilometers over four years to the main asteroid belt. There, it visited Ceres
and another asteroid, Vesta. Dawn's stunning images transformed
Piazzi's dot of light into a spectacular landscape
of craters, landslides, and mountains.

**Transcript**:
In 1879, amateur archaeologist
Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola and his young daughter Maria
explored a dark cave in Northern Spain. When Maria wondered off by herself,
she made an amazing discovery. They were standing inside 
a site of ancient art, the walls and roofs decorated with
prehistoric paintings and engravings, ranging from 19,000 to 35,000 years old. Similar marks of our ancestors have been
preserved in caves all over the world. The oldest we've found were made up to
40,000 years ago. What do these images tell us
about the ancient human mind and the lives of their creators? These early artists mixed minerals, clay,
charcoal, and ochre with spit or animal fat to create paint. They drew with their hands and tools,
like pads of moss, twigs, bones, and hair. In many instances, their images follow
the contours of the cave to create depth and shade. The most common depictions
are of geometric shapes, followed by large mammals, like bison,
horses, mammoths, deer, and boars. Human figures appear rarely,
as well as occasional hand prints. Some have theorized that these artworks
are the creation of hunters, or of holy men in trance-like states. And we've found examples created by
men, women, and even children. And why did they create this art? Perhaps they were documenting 
what they knew about the natural world, like modern scientists, or marking their tribal territory. Maybe the images were the culmination
of sacred hunting rituals or spiritual journeys. Or could they be art for art's sake,
the sheer joy and fulfillment of creation? As with many unsolved mysteries
of the ancient world, we may never know for sure, barring the invention 
of a time machine, that is. But while the answers remain elusive, these images are our earliest proof
of human communication, testifying to the human capacity 
for creativity thousands of years before writing. They are a distinct visual language 
that imagines the world outside the self, just like modern art forms, from graffiti and painting
to animated virtual-reality caves.

**Transcript**:
Why is it so difficult to cure cancer? We've harnessed electricity, sequenced the human genome, and eradicated small pox. But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease
that affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. Cancer arises as normal cells
accumulate mutations. Most of the time, 
cells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous
cells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues, or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable
once they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types and we don't have a magic bullet
that can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include 
a combination of surgery to remove tumors and radiation and chemotherapy
to kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored
for a specific type of cancer are sometimes used, too. In many cases, 
these treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective
100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures
for all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few
of the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, we need new, better ways
of studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed
using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us
critical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity
of a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs,
which work on these lab-grown cells, will fail in clinical trials 
with real patients. One of the complexities 
of aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations
of slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations
accumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor,
giving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors
called glioblastomas can have as many as six different 
subclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because
a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic 
interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly 
communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form
blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact 
with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing 
or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down
these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing 
a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate
cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem 
to have special properties that make them resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor
shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell
could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target
these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers 
from coming back. Even if we solved those problems,
we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular
characteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation
or chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively
switch on protective shields against whatever's attacking them
by changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems
that constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find
experimental systems that match their complexity, and monitoring and treatment options
that can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is 
we're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate 
for most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s
and is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives
us one more tool to add to our arsenal.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the relationship between mutations in cells and the development of cancerous cells, specifically whether mutations always result in cancerous cells. The correct answer is "False", indicating that not all mutations lead to cancer.

Question 6, on the other hand, asks about the limitation of developing cancer treatments using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. While it does not directly address the relationship between mutations and cancerous cells, it touches on the complexity of cancer and the challenges of developing effective treatments.

However, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but it's still not a perfect match.

a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic 
interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly 
communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form
blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact 
with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing 
or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down
these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing 
a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate
cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem 
to have special properties that make them resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor
shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell
could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target
these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers 
from coming back. Even if we solved those problems,
we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular
characteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation
or chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively
switch on protective shields against whatever's attacking them
by changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems
that constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find
experimental systems that match their complexity, and monitoring and treatment options
that can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is 
we're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate 
for most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s
and is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives
us one more tool to add to our arsenal.

**Transcript**:
Why is it so difficult to cure cancer? We've harnessed electricity, sequenced the human genome, and eradicated small pox. But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease
that affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. Cancer arises as normal cells
accumulate mutations. Most of the time, 
cells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous
cells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues, or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable
once they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types and we don't have a magic bullet
that can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include 
a combination of surgery to remove tumors and radiation and chemotherapy
to kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored
for a specific type of cancer are sometimes used, too. In many cases, 
these treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective
100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures
for all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few
of the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, we need new, better ways
of studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed
using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us
critical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity
of a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs,
which work on these lab-grown cells, will fail in clinical trials 
with real patients. One of the complexities 
of aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations
of slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations
accumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor,
giving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors
called glioblastomas can have as many as six different 
subclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because
a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic 
interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly 
communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form
blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact 
with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing 
or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down
these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing 
a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate
cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem 
to have special properties that make them resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor
shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell
could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target
these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers 
from coming back. Even if we solved those problems,
we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular

**Transcript**:
Let's say there's a disaster that sends
humanity back to the Stone Age. Can our knowledge and history survive? The printed page will decompose. Hard drive storage will deteriorate. Even stones will eventually crumble. But we might have something inside us that
can outlast these physical limitations: deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA already stores 
our biological information. From eye color to skin tone,
it programs our entire bodies. DNA is made of four organic bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, or A, G, C, and T. The specific sequence of these bases
into groups of three, known as codons, gives our cells instructions to make
each of the proteins in our bodies. But this code can 
be used for other things, too, like secret messages. In 1999, scientists in New York
created an alphabet in which each of the 64 
possible DNA codons substituted for a specific letter,
number, or grammar symbol. They spliced a 22-character message
into a long strand of DNA and surrounded it with specific
genetic markers. They then hid the DNA over a period
in a type-written letter with only a small smudge
to give the location away. They mailed the letter back to themselves. Then they examined the letter
looking for the DNA strand. Once the DNA strand was located,
they found the genetic markers. Then, they sequenced the DNA
and successfully decoded the message. It soon became obvious 
that DNA cryptography could code for much more
than simple text. By translating the 1's and 0's
of binary code into DNA codons, digital data could be programmed
into synthetic DNA, then decoded back into its original form. In 2012, UK scientists encoded
739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands, including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets and an excerpt from Martin 
Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech. And four years later, researchers at
Microsoft and the University of Washington broke that record. They used binary coding to capture
a whopping 200 megabytes of data, including the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and a high-def OK Go music video, all in strings of DNA. As far as storage capacity goes, DNA stands out because of the surprising
amount of information it can hold in so little space. The current theoretical limit 
of DNA'S storage capacity is so high that you could fit 100 million HD movies
on a pencil eraser. It's even conceivable that one day
we could fit all of the information currently on the Internet into the space of a shoe box. Also, computers and the magnetic tape and
discs that their information is stored on only last for a few decades, at most,
before degrading and becoming unreliable. Meanwhile, DNA 
has a half-life of 500 years, meaning that's how long it takes
for half of its bonds to break. And if left in a cold 
and dark environment, DNA could potentially last
for hundreds of thousands of years. And if that isn't long enough, scientists experimented with having
synthetic DNA auto-reproduce. After creating their own strands of DNA that spelled out the lyrics to
the children's song "It's a Small World," they placed them into the genome of
a microbe nicknamed Conan the Bacterium. Conan belongs to a species 
which can survive in a vacuum, or without water, for six years, or come out unscathed after being
exposed to a dose of radiation 1,000 times that which would kill a human. According to the experiment, the bacterium was able to reproduce at
least 100 generations without data loss. Theoretically, if the organism
had redundant copies of the information that could be used to automatically
correct mistakes, the information could stay
preserved even longer. So one day, you might be able to create
a living, growing, knowledge archive in your own backyard, and its seeds might carry
your family's history, a detailed breakdown 
of the world's political upheavals, or the sum of humanity's knowledge
into forests and across continents. Perhaps even into the 
far reaches of space. Though we might one day disappear,
perhaps our legacy can still live on, if anyone would think to find it.

But since it's not an exact match, I'll also provide an alternative answer. If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question style and format, I would choose Question 4, which asks about the theoretical limit of DNA's storage capacity, and modify it to match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3, with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
Let's say there's a disaster that sends
humanity back to the Stone Age. Can our knowledge and history survive? The printed page will decompose. Hard drive storage will deteriorate. Even stones will eventually crumble. But we might have something inside us that
can outlast these physical limitations: deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA already stores 
our biological information. From eye color to skin tone,
it programs our entire bodies. DNA is made of four organic bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, or A, G, C, and T. The specific sequence of these bases
into groups of three, known as codons, gives our cells instructions to make
each of the proteins in our bodies. But this code can 
be used for other things, too, like secret messages. In 1999, scientists in New York
created an alphabet in which each of the 64 
possible DNA codons substituted for a specific letter,
number, or grammar symbol. They spliced a 22-character message
into a long strand of DNA and surrounded it with specific
genetic markers. They then hid the DNA over a period
in a type-written letter with only a small smudge
to give the location away. They mailed the letter back to themselves. Then they examined the letter
looking for the DNA strand. Once the DNA strand was located,
they found the genetic markers. Then, they sequenced the DNA
and successfully decoded the message. It soon became obvious 
that DNA cryptography could code for much more
than simple text. By translating the 1's and 0's
of binary code into DNA codons, digital data could be programmed
into synthetic DNA, then decoded back into its original form. In 2012, UK scientists encoded
739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands, including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets and an excerpt from Martin 
Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech. And four years later, researchers at
Microsoft and the University of Washington broke that record. They used binary coding to capture
a whopping 200 megabytes of data, including the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and a high-def OK Go music video, all in strings of DNA. As far as storage capacity goes, DNA stands out because of the surprising
amount of information it can hold in so little space. The current theoretical limit 
of DNA'S storage capacity is so high that you could fit 100 million HD movies
on a pencil eraser. It's even conceivable that one day
we could fit all of the information currently on the Internet into the space of a shoe box. Also, computers and the magnetic tape and
discs that their information is stored on only last for a few decades, at most,
before degrading and becoming unreliable. Meanwhile, DNA 
has a half-life of 500 years, meaning that's how long it takes
for half of its bonds to break. And if left in a cold 
and dark environment, DNA could potentially last
for hundreds of thousands of years. And if that isn't long enough, scientists experimented with having
synthetic DNA auto-reproduce. After creating their own strands of DNA that spelled out the lyrics to
the children's song "It's a Small World," they placed them into the genome of
a microbe nicknamed Conan the Bacterium. Conan belongs to a species 
which can survive in a vacuum, or without water, for six years, or come out unscathed after being
exposed to a dose of radiation 1,000 times that which would kill a human. According to the experiment, the bacterium was able to reproduce at
least 100 generations without data loss. Theoretically, if the organism
had redundant copies of the information that could be used to automatically
correct mistakes, the information could stay
preserved even longer. So one day, you might be able to create
a living, growing, knowledge archive in your own backyard, and its seeds might carry
your family's history, a detailed breakdown 
of the world's political upheavals, or the sum of humanity's knowledge
into forests and across continents. Perhaps even into the 
far reaches of space. Though we might one day disappear,
perhaps our legacy can still live on, if anyone would think to find it.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it is asking about the half-life of DNA, not the lifespan of magnetic tape. 

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the lifespan of current digital storage formats. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 5: What is the main advantage of using DNA for data storage compared to traditional methods? is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it implies that traditional methods have limitations, but it does not specifically mention the lifespan of magnetic tape.

However, I found another question that is a bit more relevant. It is not among the options, but I can suggest a possible match:

 Question 9 in the generated MCQs mentions that "computers and the magnetic tape and discs that their information is stored on only last for a few decades, at most, before degrading and becoming unreliable" in its explanation for the correct answer to Question 9, but the question itself does not ask about the lifespan of magnetic tape.

If I had to choose one from the options, I would say that Question 5 or Question 9 could be considered the most similar, but I must emphasize that neither of these questions is a perfect match.

Since I must provide an index, I will choose Question 5, but please note that this is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians
made a surprising discovery. If they scraped the bark 
off a particular kind of tree and ate it, their pain disappeared. Little did they know that why they'd found was destined to influence 
the future course of medicine. What the Sumerians had discovered was
a precursor to the medicine known today as aspirin. Aspirin's active ingredient is found
commonly in willow trees and other wild plants, which is how it came to infuse
the medical traditions of Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and other cultures. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought 
of as the father of modern medicine, first recommended chewing willow bark
for pain relief and making willow leaf tea
to ease the pain of childbirth. But it took over 2,000 years for us to
comprehensively investigate its potential. In the mid-18th century, an Englishman named Edward Stone
ran five years of experiments, showing that willow bark crushed
into a powder and eaten could cure a fever. It took nearly another 70 years
for a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner, to finally identify and purify
the substance that made all this possible, a compound called salicin. By then, doctors were routinely
using willow bark and other salicin-rich plants,
like the herb meadowsweet, to ease pain, fever, and inflammation. But identifying the exact compound
suddenly opened up the possibility of manipulating its form. In 1853, a French chemist managed
to chemically synthesize the compound, creating a substance called
acetylsalicylic acid. Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company
Bayer found a new method and began marketing the compound
as a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of
the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was 
just Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is
Spiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with
acetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found
to ease not just pain, but also many 
inflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames 
the fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't
actually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish 
and British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts
the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission 
of pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won 
the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered
aspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding
in the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness
that affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed
by newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries
about aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners 
also demonstrated that aspirin slows production 
of thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping
of platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that
aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people
at risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots
forming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research
that suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting
and dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's 
anti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may
decrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin
from a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment. Today, we consume about 100 billion
aspirin tablets each year, and researchers continue searching
for new applications. Already, aspirin's versatility 
has transformed modern medicine, which is astounding considering
its humble beginnings in a scraping of willow bark.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a scientist who was not involved in the history of aspirin. The generated MCQs do not have a direct match for this question. However, I can suggest Question 4, which asks about the name of the compound that Johann Buchner first identified and purified from willow bark. While this question does not ask about a scientist who was not involved in the history of aspirin, it does mention Johann Buchner, who is a relevant scientist in the context of aspirin's history.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about scientists involved in the history of aspirin, but unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs have this exact intent.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5, which asks about the significance of the 1982 Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded to Swedish and British scientists. This question mentions scientists who were involved in the history of aspirin, but it does not ask about a scientist who was not involved.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (but Question 4 or Question 5 could be considered as a weak match)

**Transcript**:
4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians
made a surprising discovery. If they scraped the bark 
off a particular kind of tree and ate it, their pain disappeared. Little did they know that why they'd found was destined to influence 
the future course of medicine. What the Sumerians had discovered was
a precursor to the medicine known today as aspirin. Aspirin's active ingredient is found
commonly in willow trees and other wild plants, which is how it came to infuse
the medical traditions of Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and other cultures. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought 
of as the father of modern medicine, first recommended chewing willow bark
for pain relief and making willow leaf tea
to ease the pain of childbirth. But it took over 2,000 years for us to
comprehensively investigate its potential. In the mid-18th century, an Englishman named Edward Stone
ran five years of experiments, showing that willow bark crushed
into a powder and eaten could cure a fever. It took nearly another 70 years
for a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner, to finally identify and purify
the substance that made all this possible, a compound called salicin. By then, doctors were routinely
using willow bark and other salicin-rich plants,
like the herb meadowsweet, to ease pain, fever, and inflammation. But identifying the exact compound
suddenly opened up the possibility of manipulating its form. In 1853, a French chemist managed
to chemically synthesize the compound, creating a substance called
acetylsalicylic acid. Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company
Bayer found a new method and began marketing the compound
as a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of
the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was 
just Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is
Spiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with
acetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found
to ease not just pain, but also many 
inflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames 
the fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't
actually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish 
and British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts
the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission 
of pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won 
the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered
aspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding
in the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness
that affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed
by newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries
about aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners 
also demonstrated that aspirin slows production 
of thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping
of platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that
aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people
at risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots
forming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research
that suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting
and dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's 
anti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may
decrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin
from a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment. Today, we consume about 100 billion
aspirin tablets each year, and researchers continue searching
for new applications. Already, aspirin's versatility 
has transformed modern medicine, which is astounding considering
its humble beginnings in a scraping of willow bark.

as a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of
the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was 
just Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is
Spiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with
acetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found
to ease not just pain, but also many 
inflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames 
the fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't
actually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish 
and British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts
the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission 
of pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won 
the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered
aspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding
in the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness
that affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed
by newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries
about aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners 
also demonstrated that aspirin slows production 
of thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping
of platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that
aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people
at risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots
forming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research
that suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting
and dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's 
anti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may
decrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin
from a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment. Today, we consume about 100 billion
aspirin tablets each year, and researchers continue searching
for new applications. Already, aspirin's versatility 
has transformed modern medicine, which is astounding considering
its humble beginnings in a scraping of willow bark.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1970’s, Erno Rubik invented the
Rubik’s cube. But that doesn’t mean knew how to solve it. It took him a few moths  to figure
it out. By the time the first World Rubik’s Cube
Championships were held in 1982, The winner -- he could solve the cube in a
little less than 23 seconds. And these days?
[news montage of collin’s record] This is world record holder Collin Burns, and
today, we find out how he did it. [TITLES] “It could last another day; it could last
another few years. The previous record lasted for just over 2 years. But with single solve,
especially, you just need to get lucky. Or at least that’s a big part of it.” Collin tends to downplay his skills but it’s
worth noting there are two types of world records.
The way speedcubing competitions work is that volunteers scramble the cubes according to
instructions that are generated by a computer, so competitors all get the same scramble. They do 5 solves and their three middle scores
are averaged. So Collin holds the world record for a single
solve. But the world record for an average score
is held by a 19-year-old in Australia. Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At
the competition where we met up with him, kids were asking him for his autograph. He’s now being sponsored by a cube company
and by a cube retailer, which are paying for him to travel internationally. And he wants
people to know, you could do this too. “The biggest misconception about cubing
is that it’s difficult, which it really isn’t.”
Pop culture treats the Rubik’s cube like some sort of IQ test, but it’s not. At least
not anymore. “Generally average is much more impressive
because you have to be consistently fast.” Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At
the competition where we met up with him, other kids were asking him for autographs.
“are you that famous cube guy?” I recently bought a cube online and it came
with instructions for beginners. And if you memorize those, you can solve the cube in
a couple minutes. It helps to understand the design of the puzzle.
At first glance, it looks like a cube made out of cubes — right, three layers of nine. But if you look closer, you’ll see there
aren’t actually any cubes here. So that tells you that the corners will always be
corners, the edges will always be edges, and the middle pieces determine the color of that
face. Speedcubers will buy special cubes. They can
lubricate them and adjust the tension. But the real key to their speed is efficiency
- they’re looking several moves ahead, and they use fewer moves to get the same result. So there are 43 quintillion possible arrangements
for the cube. A few years back, some researchers borrowed
computing power from Google to find out that any scramble can be solved in 20 moves or
less. They call it God’s Number. But humans just aren’t that good. The beginners’ method that I learned uses
100 to 200 moves. Speedcubers use more around 50 to 60 moves.
And they can do that, in part, because of the knowledge gained by the previous generation
of speedcubers. When the cube first spread around the world
back in the 80s, people had to learn through trial and error. This was happening in a lot of math departments
and campus clubs. People were discovering the cube at the same time, and they were sharing
what they learned. The method Collin uses was developed by Jessica
Fridrich, an engineering professor who was a college student at the time. It starts with a cross on one of the faces.
And that face becomes the bottom layer. Then what they do is solve the corners of the bottom
layer and the middle layer simultaneously. “So, now you can see that all of this is
solved.” And for the final layer, they’re choosing
from dozens of algorithms that they’ve memorized. And those are sequences of moves that mess
up the cube temporarily to move certain pieces into place. And then put the rest of the cube
back where it was. The Rubik’s cube has made a comeback in
recent years along with that same ethic of sharing tips and strategies. So all the resources you need are there, there’s
just one other thing. Practice! This is Collin nearly 5 years ago. world records
are not built in a day.

**Transcript**:
In 1984, an enterprising Australian doctor
named Barry Marshall decided to take a risk. Too many of his patients were complaining
of severe abdominal pain due to stomach ulcers, which are sores in the lining
of the upper intestinal tract. At the time, few effective treatments
for ulcers existed, and many sufferers required
hospitalization or even surgery. Desperate for answers, Dr. Marshall swallowed a cloudy
broth of bacteria collected from the stomach
of one of his patients. Soon, Dr. Marshall was experiencing
the same abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting. Ten days later, a camera called 
an endoscope peered inside his insides. Marshall's stomach was teeming
with the same bacteria as his patient. He'd also developed gastritis,
or severe inflammation of the stomach, the hallmark precursor of ulcers. Dr. Marshall's idea challenged a misconception 
that still persists to this day: that ulcers are caused by stress, food, or too much stomach acid. Marshall thought the culprit
was bacterial infections. Initially, his idea was considered crazy by the brightest medical 
minds on the planet. But in 2005, he and Dr. Robin Warren
received the ultimate validation when they were awarded the Nobel
Prize for medicine. Our stomachs are J-shaped organs
with surprisingly intricate ecosystems awash in hormones and chemicals. The stomach is under constant attack
by digestive enzymes, bile, proteins, microbes, and the stomach's own acid. In response, it produces bicarbonate, mucus, and phospholipids called prostaglandins to maintain the integrity
of its own lining. This delicate balance is constantly
regulated and referred to as mucosal defense. Since the mid-1800s, doctors thought
stress alone caused most stomach ulcers. Patients were given antidepressants
or tranquilizers and told to visit health spas. This belief eventually shifted
to the related notion of spicy foods and stress as culprits. Yet no convincing study has ever
demonstrated that emotional upset, psychological distress, or spicy food directly causes ulcer disease. By the mid-20th century, it was widely
accepted that excess hydrochloric acid prompted the stomach to eat itself. Fervent proponents of this idea
were referred to as the acid mafia. The biggest hole in this theory
was that antiacids only provide temporary relief. We now know that some rare ulcers are indeed caused 
by too much hydrochloric acid. But they make up less than 1%
of all cases. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren pinpointed
a spiral-shaped bacteria called Helicobacter pylori,
or H. pylori, as the real offender. H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest
and most frequent companions, having joined us at least 50,000
years ago, and now found in 50% of people. Previously, we thought the stomach
was sterile on account of it being such an acidic,
hostile environment. Yet H. pylori survives the acidic turmoil
of the stomach with a variety of features that disrupt
mucosal defense in its favor. For example, it produces an enzyme
called urease that helps protect it from 
the surrounding gastric acid. H. pylori can make over 1,500 proteins, many of which are dedicated to maximizing
its virulence. We still have unanswered questions, like why specific people develop ulcers
at particular times. However, we do know individual genetics, other medical problems, use of certain medications, smoking, and the genetic diversity 
of Helicobacter strains all play a role. In particular, certain pain medications
used to reduce inflammation in joints have been discovered to work
with H. pylori to create more severe stomach ulcers. Dr. Marshall ended up being fine after
his famous, albeit dangerous, experiment. He ingested a course of antibiotics
similar to the ones taken now for ulcers. To be treated by simple antibiotics
is a modern triumph for a disease that previously 
needed surgery. Marshall's work also reminded us that
scientific progress is not always smooth. But there's value in trusting 
your proverbial, and sometimes literal, gut.

that still persists to this day: that ulcers are caused by stress, food, or too much stomach acid. Marshall thought the culprit
was bacterial infections. Initially, his idea was considered crazy by the brightest medical 
minds on the planet. But in 2005, he and Dr. Robin Warren
received the ultimate validation when they were awarded the Nobel
Prize for medicine. Our stomachs are J-shaped organs
with surprisingly intricate ecosystems awash in hormones and chemicals. The stomach is under constant attack
by digestive enzymes, bile, proteins, microbes, and the stomach's own acid. In response, it produces bicarbonate, mucus, and phospholipids called prostaglandins to maintain the integrity
of its own lining. This delicate balance is constantly
regulated and referred to as mucosal defense. Since the mid-1800s, doctors thought
stress alone caused most stomach ulcers. Patients were given antidepressants
or tranquilizers and told to visit health spas. This belief eventually shifted
to the related notion of spicy foods and stress as culprits. Yet no convincing study has ever
demonstrated that emotional upset, psychological distress, or spicy food directly causes ulcer disease. By the mid-20th century, it was widely
accepted that excess hydrochloric acid prompted the stomach to eat itself. Fervent proponents of this idea
were referred to as the acid mafia. The biggest hole in this theory
was that antiacids only provide temporary relief. We now know that some rare ulcers are indeed caused 
by too much hydrochloric acid. But they make up less than 1%
of all cases. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren pinpointed
a spiral-shaped bacteria called Helicobacter pylori,
or H. pylori, as the real offender. H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest
and most frequent companions, having joined us at least 50,000
years ago, and now found in 50% of people. Previously, we thought the stomach
was sterile on account of it being such an acidic,
hostile environment. Yet H. pylori survives the acidic turmoil
of the stomach with a variety of features that disrupt
mucosal defense in its favor. For example, it produces an enzyme
called urease that helps protect it from 
the surrounding gastric acid. H. pylori can make over 1,500 proteins, many of which are dedicated to maximizing
its virulence. We still have unanswered questions, like why specific people develop ulcers
at particular times. However, we do know individual genetics, other medical problems, use of certain medications, smoking, and the genetic diversity 
of Helicobacter strains all play a role. In particular, certain pain medications
used to reduce inflammation in joints have been discovered to work
with H. pylori to create more severe stomach ulcers. Dr. Marshall ended up being fine after
his famous, albeit dangerous, experiment. He ingested a course of antibiotics
similar to the ones taken now for ulcers. To be treated by simple antibiotics
is a modern triumph for a disease that previously 
needed surgery. Marshall's work also reminded us that
scientific progress is not always smooth. But there's value in trusting 
your proverbial, and sometimes literal, gut.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: According to the transcript, what percentage of stomach ulcers are caused by excess hydrochloric acid? Options: A. Less than 1%, B. Around 10%, C. Approximately 50%, D. More than 90% Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly. A more similar question would be one that asks about the prevalence of H. pylori in the population.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. But if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of content and intent, I would suggest:

**Question 6: What is the name of the spiral-shaped bacteria that Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren identified as the primary cause of stomach ulcers? Options: A. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), B. Staphylococcus aureus, C. Escherichia coli (E. coli), D. Campylobacter jejuni Correct Option: A**

However, this question is not about the prevalence of H. pylori, but rather about the name of the bacteria.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is **Question 6** (although it's not a perfect match).

But, after re-reading the generated MCQs, I realized that I missed one important detail. The ground truth MCQ is about the prevalence of H. pylori in the population, and one of the generated MCQs mentions that H. pylori is found in 50% of people.

So, the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but I can suggest a question that contains the correct information:

**Question 8 does not match, but it contains the correct information: ...and the genetic diversity of Helicobacter strains all play a role. In particular, it is mentioned in the transcript that: H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest and most frequent companions, having joined us at least 50,000 years ago, and now found in 50% of people.**

However, this is not a direct question.

I'll provide the index of the question that contains the correct information:

**Index: Not Available (but the correct information is in the transcript and mentioned in Question 8, but not as a direct question).**

However, I must provide an index as per the instructions. In this case, I will provide the index of the question that contains the correct information, although it's not a direct question:

**Index: 8**

**Transcript**:
During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses on juvenile horseshoe crabs rather than adult horseshoe crabs.

A more suitable match is not present among the provided generated MCQs, as none of them directly address the question of where adult horseshoe crabs live. However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the available options, I would choose Question 2, but with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be:

Question: Where do adult horseshoe crabs primarily live?
Options: A. On the beach, B. In the shallows, C. In the deep sea, D. We don’t know for sure
Correct Option: D

This new MCQ directly addresses the question of where adult horseshoe crabs live and provides the correct answer based on the transcript.

However, since I need to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ from the provided options, I will choose Question 2, with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures.

**Transcript**:
The universe is bustling with matter
and energy. Even in the vast apparent emptiness
of intergalactic space, there's one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. That's not the mention 
a barrage of particles and electromagnetic radiation passing every which way from stars,
galaxies, and into black holes. There's even radiation left over
from the Big Bang. So is there such thing as a total
absence of everything? This isn't just a thought experiment. Empty spaces, or vacuums,
are incredibly useful. Inside our homes, 
most vacuum cleaners work by using a fan to create a low-pressure
relatively empty area that sucks matter in to fill the void. But that's far from empty. There's still plenty of matter
bouncing around. Manufacturers rely on more thorough,
sealed vacuums for all sorts of purposes. That includes vacuum-packed food
that stays fresh longer, and the vacuums inside early light bulbs
that protected filaments from degrading. These vacuums are generally created
with some version of what a vacuum cleaner does using high-powered pumps that create
enough suction to remove as many stray atoms as possible. But the best of these industrial processes tends to leave hundreds 
of millions of atoms per cubic centimeter of space. That isn't empty enough
for scientists who work on experiments, like the Large Hadron Collider, where particle beams need to circulate
at close to the speed of light for up to ten hours without hitting
any stray atoms. So how do they create a vacuum? The LHC's pipes are made of materials,
like stainless steel, that don't release any 
of their own molecules and are lined with a special coating
to absorb stray gases. Raising the temperature 
to 200 degrees Celsius burns off any moisture, and hundreds of vacuum pumps take
two weeks to trap enough gas and debris out of the pipes for the collider's
incredibly sensitive experiments. Even with all this, the Large Hadron Collider
isn't a perfect vacuum. In the emptiest places, there are still about 100,000 particles 
per cubic centimeter. But let's say an experiment like that
could somehow get every last atom out. There's still an unfathomably huge
amount of radiation all around us that can pass right through
the walls. Every second, about 50 muons
from cosmic rays, 10 million neutrinos coming directly
from the Big Bang, 30 million photons from the cosmic
microwave background, and 300 trillion neutrinos
from the Sun pass through your body. It is possible to shield
vacuum chambers with substances, including water, that absorb and reflect this radiation, except for neutrinos. Let's say you've somehow removed
all of the atoms and blocked all of the radiation. Is the space now totally empty? Actually, no. All space is filled with what 
physicists call quantum fields. What we think of as subatomic particles, electrons and photons and their relatives, are actually vibrations 
in a quantum fabric that extends throughout the universe. And because of a physical law called
the Heisenberg Principle, these fields never stop oscillating, even without any particles 
to set off the ripples. They always have some minimum fluctuation
called a vacuum fluctuation. This means they have energy,
a huge amount of it. Because Einstein's equations tell us
that mass and energy are equivalent, the quantum fluctuations in every
cubic meter of space have an energy that corresponds
to a mass of about four protons. In other words, the seemingly empty space
inside your vacuum would actually weigh a small amount. Quantum fluctuations have existed since
the earliest moments of the universe. In the moments after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded, they were amplified and stretched out
to cosmic scales. Cosmologists believe that these original
quantum fluctuations were the seeds of everything
we see today: galaxies and the entire large scale
structure of the universe, as well as planets and solar systems. They're also the center of one of the
greatest scientific mysteries of our time because according to the current theories, the quantum fluctuations 
in the vacuum of space ought to have 120 orders of magnitude
more energy than we observe. Solving the mystery of that missing energy may entirely rewrite our understanding
of physics and the universe.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it is the most similar in terms of question intent and options. The ground truth MCQ asks about the types of particles from cosmic sources that go through the human body most frequently, while Question 6 asks about the type of radiation that can pass through the walls of a vacuum chamber and cannot be shielded by substances like water. However, both questions are related to the topic of particles and radiation passing through a medium, and both have options that include types of particles or radiation (neutrinos, muons, photons, etc.).

That being said, if I had to choose a question that matches the content of the ground truth MCQ more closely, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and vacuum creation.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: "What are the main challenges in creating a perfect vacuum for experiments like the Large Hadron Collider?" While this question does not specifically ask about the coating of the beam pipes, it is related to the LHC and vacuum creation.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is very specific about the coating of the beam pipes, and none of the generated MCQs address this topic.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4 (index 4), but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

It's worth noting that the generated MCQs seem to be more focused on the general topics of vacuum creation, particle physics, and the Large Hadron Collider, whereas the ground truth MCQ is very specific about the coating of the beam pipes.

**Transcript**:
The universe is bustling with matter
and energy. Even in the vast apparent emptiness
of intergalactic space, there's one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. That's not the mention 
a barrage of particles and electromagnetic radiation passing every which way from stars,
galaxies, and into black holes. There's even radiation left over
from the Big Bang. So is there such thing as a total
absence of everything? This isn't just a thought experiment. Empty spaces, or vacuums,
are incredibly useful. Inside our homes, 
most vacuum cleaners work by using a fan to create a low-pressure
relatively empty area that sucks matter in to fill the void. But that's far from empty. There's still plenty of matter
bouncing around. Manufacturers rely on more thorough,
sealed vacuums for all sorts of purposes. That includes vacuum-packed food
that stays fresh longer, and the vacuums inside early light bulbs
that protected filaments from degrading. These vacuums are generally created
with some version of what a vacuum cleaner does using high-powered pumps that create
enough suction to remove as many stray atoms as possible. But the best of these industrial processes tends to leave hundreds 
of millions of atoms per cubic centimeter of space. That isn't empty enough
for scientists who work on experiments, like the Large Hadron Collider, where particle beams need to circulate
at close to the speed of light for up to ten hours without hitting
any stray atoms. So how do they create a vacuum? The LHC's pipes are made of materials,
like stainless steel, that don't release any 
of their own molecules and are lined with a special coating
to absorb stray gases. Raising the temperature 
to 200 degrees Celsius burns off any moisture, and hundreds of vacuum pumps take
two weeks to trap enough gas and debris out of the pipes for the collider's
incredibly sensitive experiments. Even with all this, the Large Hadron Collider
isn't a perfect vacuum. In the emptiest places, there are still about 100,000 particles 
per cubic centimeter. But let's say an experiment like that
could somehow get every last atom out. There's still an unfathomably huge
amount of radiation all around us that can pass right through
the walls. Every second, about 50 muons
from cosmic rays, 10 million neutrinos coming directly
from the Big Bang, 30 million photons from the cosmic
microwave background, and 300 trillion neutrinos
from the Sun pass through your body. It is possible to shield
vacuum chambers with substances, including water, that absorb and reflect this radiation, except for neutrinos. Let's say you've somehow removed
all of the atoms and blocked all of the radiation. Is the space now totally empty? Actually, no. All space is filled with what 
physicists call quantum fields. What we think of as subatomic particles, electrons and photons and their relatives, are actually vibrations 
in a quantum fabric that extends throughout the universe. And because of a physical law called
the Heisenberg Principle, these fields never stop oscillating, even without any particles 
to set off the ripples. They always have some minimum fluctuation
called a vacuum fluctuation. This means they have energy,
a huge amount of it. Because Einstein's equations tell us
that mass and energy are equivalent, the quantum fluctuations in every
cubic meter of space have an energy that corresponds
to a mass of about four protons. In other words, the seemingly empty space
inside your vacuum would actually weigh a small amount. Quantum fluctuations have existed since
the earliest moments of the universe. In the moments after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded, they were amplified and stretched out
to cosmic scales. Cosmologists believe that these original
quantum fluctuations were the seeds of everything
we see today: galaxies and the entire large scale
structure of the universe, as well as planets and solar systems. They're also the center of one of the
greatest scientific mysteries of our time because according to the current theories, the quantum fluctuations 
in the vacuum of space ought to have 120 orders of magnitude
more energy than we observe. Solving the mystery of that missing energy may entirely rewrite our understanding
of physics and the universe.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

This is because both the ground truth MCQ and Question 2 focus on how vacuum cleaners work, specifically the mechanism of creating a low-pressure area to suck in matter. The correct options in both questions (B in the ground truth MCQ and C in Question 2) convey the same idea, although the wording is slightly different. The other options in both questions are also similar in that they provide incorrect or misleading explanations for how vacuum cleaners work. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2.

**Transcript**:
What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield
have in common? They all came up with elegant
proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus
the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most
fundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings
and triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician
in the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a
thousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
lists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate 
that Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,
to make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch
a knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length
3, 4 and 5. According to the converse
of the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known 
Indian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across
the diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large
as the original one. That relationship can be derived
from the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know 
that the theorem is true for every right triangle 
on a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians
and surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules
and logic to demonstrate that a theorem
must hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed
to Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called 
proof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles
with side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
form a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles
into two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares
are a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of 
the figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles
didn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to 
the empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek
mathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon
almost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle
into two others and uses the principle that if the
corresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides
is the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions
for their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations
together and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern
for a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time
to think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square
contains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like 
to convince yourself, you could build a turntable
with three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other 
around a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water
and spin the turntable, the water from the large square
will perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more
than 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ is about a rope stretched across the diagonal of a square, which is related to the Pythagorean theorem. Among the generated MCQs, none directly matches this question. However, Question 3 mentions a surveyor using a knotted rope to create a square corner, which is somewhat related to the concept of using a rope to demonstrate the Pythagorean theorem.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 3 as the closest match based on the content and intent. However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the concept of a rope stretched across the diagonal of a square.

**Transcript**:
What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield
have in common? They all came up with elegant
proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus
the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most
fundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings
and triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician
in the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a
thousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
lists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate 
that Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,
to make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch
a knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length
3, 4 and 5. According to the converse
of the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known 
Indian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across
the diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large
as the original one. That relationship can be derived
from the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know 
that the theorem is true for every right triangle 
on a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians
and surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules
and logic to demonstrate that a theorem
must hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed
to Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called 
proof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles
with side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
form a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles
into two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares
are a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of 
the figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles
didn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to 
the empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek
mathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon
almost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle
into two others and uses the principle that if the
corresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides
is the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions
for their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations
together and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern
for a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time
to think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square
contains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like 
to convince yourself, you could build a turntable
with three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other 
around a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water
and spin the turntable, the water from the large square
will perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more
than 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix?

**Transcript**:
[PBS Intro] This episode is supported by 23 and Me A long time ago a guy built a tomb out of
rocks so he could live in it after he died and not be dead. His son was like “Hey that’s cool” so
he built one too.. Then his son was like “Me too” so he
made a third and they were all buried there. And that’s how we got this. The pyramids of Giza. How did people who hadn’t even invented
the wheel build these things, and… why? They’re so big! They’re so precise! They’re so directionally oriented! They’re so mysterrrrrrious. At first glance they really do look out-of-this
world. Thing is, the pyramids are much older than
you probably think. They were already ancient history to people
IN ancient history, which led to some pretty wild theories about how they came to be. But pyramid technology didn’t just show
up out of nowhere. It was the end product of centuries of scientific
and cultural evolution, of people… figuring it out. And it definitely wasn’t aliens. [OPEN] Early on, Egyptians buried their dead like
we do. The desert naturally mummified some corpses,
which influenced their religious beliefs: You need to preserve the body to reach the
afterlife, and when you get there you’ll need all your stuff. Rich people’s graves had nicer stuff, and
they needed to protect their afterlife investment. First with simple mounds, and later with mud
brick “eternal houses”. Then a king named Djoser was like “Why have
one little mud mastaba when I can have six stone mastabas in a stack?” so he stacked
six stone mastabas like a mastaba boss and the age of the pyramids had begun. This was literally the first time humans had
piled stone this high. Egyptians knew totally vertical walls got
less stable as they got taller, so Djoser’s architect stacked bricks at an incline and
let gravity do the work. Step pyramid achieved! Why pyramids and not other shapes? If you want to make a big pile of blocks,
a pyramid gets you the most stability for the least material. A third of the way up, you’ve already laid
two-thirds of your stone. Halfway, you’ve placed more than 80%. Next comes Sneferu, Mr. Pyramid. He built his own step pyramid, but then decided
he wanted a smooth one instead, so they started on a second. No one had ever built one of those before,
so they made some mistakes. For starters, they built it on sand, which
is soft, they laid blocks carelessly, and it was too steep, so halfway through they
changed the slope and ended up with this. Sneferu was like “you’re not burying me
in that”, so he ordered a third pyramid! Only this time they built a solid foundation,
laid the stones in horizontal rows, and precision cut the edges. Sneferu’s motto? If at first you don’t succeed, try again,
and then try again one more time. Sneferu had experimented his way to a blueprint
for building awesome pyramids The Great Pyramid at Giza, built by his son
Khufu, took that blueprint to the next level. Khufu’s pyramid remained the tallest structure
on Earth for almost 4000 years, until some church tower in the year 1311, which fell
down, so it was tallest again until this radio antenna was finished in 1889. Khufu’s son Khafre built his pyramid right
next to dad’s, and he didn’t stop innovating. Instead of leveling the entire 46,000 square
meter footprint, he built his pyramid over a natural stone mound and only leveled the
outer edge, which was less work, duh! It’s 3 meters shorter than his dad’s,
but this higher ground creates the illusion that Khafre’s pyramid is taller. Kids, amirite? But even these seemingly perfect pyramids
weren’t without mistakes. Khafre’s had a slight twist near the top
in order to make the edges line up evenly. What’s remarkable is Egypt’s biggest stone
pyramids were the product of just three human generations, but those were generations full
of trial and error. Pyramid building continued for nearly 700
years, and like any product, efficiency started to win out over quality. Precision-cut cores were replaced by rough-cut
blocks. Kings still wrapped their pyramids in fine
white limestone, but over the next thousand years that was removed by stone stealers and
rock robbers, leaving the cheaply-produced cores to collapse into rubble, which is probably
why you’ve never heard of them. Ironically, the kings were probably disappointed
by the whole afterlife thing, but the pyramids themselves have proven to be surprisingly
resilient. Ancient is not a synonym for stupid. The world’s first skyscrapers were tombs,
and just like our own buildings, they didn’t spring up out of nowhere, they were the product
of centuries of engineering trial and error. Go back 500 years and show someone a smartphone
and they’d probably think you were a wizard. But when we look back from the present at
the ideas and failures along the way, we see that it’s not magic at all! It’s science. And if you still think aliens did it, you’re
in de-Nile. You know, the river. Stay curious.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not discuss the evolution of pyramids from mounds piled on top of rich Egyptians' graves.

A more relevant generated MCQ could be created by combining elements of Questions 2 and 6, which discuss the ancient Egyptians' beliefs and the evolution of pyramids. However, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match.

But since it doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, let's try to find a better match.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 6 does discuss the pyramid shape and its advantages, which is somewhat related to the evolution of pyramids from mounds.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would argue that Question 6 is the closest match among the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
On July 26, 1943, Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes and blocked out the Sun. Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn't an act of war. It was smog. A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog, the word "smog" was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities such as London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. This industrial smog was known to form when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories combined with moisture in the air. But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different. It was yellowish with a chemical odor. Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits: volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors and may contain elements, such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals, but others come from manmade sources, like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum. Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles releases nitrogen oxide. That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color. VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone. PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue. Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog, which is what had been plaguing LA. So why does smog affect some cities
but not others? Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution with local weather and geography. London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog. Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds and dry, warm, sunny weather. The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation. Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA, or lying in a basin, like Beijing, are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate. That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion, where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward, a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface by a slightly warmer layer above. Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore. Both forms of smog irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema, and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis. Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight and potential birth defects. Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield, making them more susceptible to insects. Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization. Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog swirling over their streets until 1952, when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths. As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956 banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city, leading to a massive reduction in smog. Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them. Smog remains a major problem
around the world. Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy experience high levels of industrial smog. Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions affect many rapidly developing cities, from Mexico City and Santiago to New Delhi and Tehran. Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it, such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time. As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the product of incomplete combustion that gives photochemical smog its yellowish color, and Question 3 asks about the primary contributors to the formation of photochemical smog, they both deal with the composition of photochemical smog. 

However, a more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the product of incomplete combustion that gives photochemical smog its yellowish color. Since such a question is not present among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest match.

It is worth noting that the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ is nitrous oxide (more specifically, nitrogen oxides), which is mentioned in Question 3 as one of the primary contributors to the formation of photochemical smog.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, we can identify a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about common sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions VOCs as one of the primary contributors to the formation of photochemical smog.

However, a more relevant match can be found in the transcript, which mentions that VOCs can come from manmade sources like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum, as well as from natural sources like plants and animals.

If we were to create a new MCQ based on this information, it would closely match the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, such an MCQ is not among the generated options.

That being said, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 3, as it at least mentions VOCs. However, please note that this is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
On July 26, 1943, Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes and blocked out the Sun. Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn't an act of war. It was smog. A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog, the word "smog" was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities such as London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. This industrial smog was known to form when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories combined with moisture in the air. But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different. It was yellowish with a chemical odor. Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits: volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors and may contain elements, such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals, but others come from manmade sources, like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum. Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles releases nitrogen oxide. That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color. VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone. PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue. Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog, which is what had been plaguing LA. So why does smog affect some cities
but not others? Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution with local weather and geography. London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog. Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds and dry, warm, sunny weather. The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation. Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA, or lying in a basin, like Beijing, are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate. That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion, where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward, a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface by a slightly warmer layer above. Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore. Both forms of smog irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema, and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis. Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight and potential birth defects. Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield, making them more susceptible to insects. Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization. Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog swirling over their streets until 1952, when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths. As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956 banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city, leading to a massive reduction in smog. Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them. Smog remains a major problem
around the world. Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy experience high levels of industrial smog. Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions affect many rapidly developing cities, from Mexico City and Santiago to New Delhi and Tehran. Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it, such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time. As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier.

**Transcript**:
This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.

**Transcript**:
This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.

For most jobs, it's understood
that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be
the most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same
as actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation 
that launches a trial, which could end in conviction
or acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for
removing a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check
on royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered
the source of all government power. But for the founders 
of the American Republic, there was no higher authority
beyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in
the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers,
up to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment
can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the
power to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter
to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient 
grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote
on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes 
by a simple majority, the official is impeached
and the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment
is held in the Senate. Selected members of the House,
known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official 
and their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating
after hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president
being impeached, the chief justice 
of the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority
of two-thirds and results in automatic removal 
from power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them
from holding office in the future and open them to standard 
criminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S.

elected members of government. Therefore, to prevent the process
from being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that 
an official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes
and misdemeanors. That still leaves a lot of room 
for interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials
have split along partisan lines. But the process is generally understood to
be reserved for serious abuses of power. The first official to be impeached was
Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease
the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Since then, the House has launched
impeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual
impeachment proceedings. The eight cases that ended
in a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges. And impeachment of a sitting president
is even more rare. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton without consulting the Senate. Over a century later, Bill Clinton 
was impeached for making false statements under oath
during a sexual harassment trial. Both were ultimately acquitted
when the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority. And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached
for the Watergate scandal. He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly
be convicted. Theoretically, the U.S. government is 
already designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches
through a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections. But impeachment can be seen
as an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail.

**Transcript**:
For most jobs, it's understood
that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be
the most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same
as actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation 
that launches a trial, which could end in conviction
or acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for
removing a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check
on royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered
the source of all government power. But for the founders 
of the American Republic, there was no higher authority
beyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in
the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers,
up to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment
can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the
power to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter
to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient 
grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote
on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes 
by a simple majority, the official is impeached
and the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment
is held in the Senate. Selected members of the House,
known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official 
and their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating
after hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president
being impeached, the chief justice 
of the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority
of two-thirds and results in automatic removal 
from power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them

criminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S.

**Transcript**:
For most jobs, it's understood
that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be
the most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same
as actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation 
that launches a trial, which could end in conviction
or acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for
removing a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check
on royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered
the source of all government power. But for the founders 
of the American Republic, there was no higher authority
beyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in
the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers,
up to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment
can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the
power to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter
to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient 
grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote
on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes 
by a simple majority, the official is impeached
and the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment
is held in the Senate. Selected members of the House,
known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official 
and their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating
after hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president
being impeached, the chief justice 
of the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority
of two-thirds and results in automatic removal 
from power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them
from holding office in the future and open them to standard 
criminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S. 
pits an elected legislature against other democratically 
elected members of government. Therefore, to prevent the process
from being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that 
an official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes
and misdemeanors. That still leaves a lot of room 
for interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials
have split along partisan lines. But the process is generally understood to
be reserved for serious abuses of power. The first official to be impeached was
Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease
the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Since then, the House has launched
impeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual
impeachment proceedings. The eight cases that ended
in a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges. And impeachment of a sitting president
is even more rare. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton without consulting the Senate. Over a century later, Bill Clinton 
was impeached for making false statements under oath
during a sexual harassment trial. Both were ultimately acquitted
when the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority. And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached
for the Watergate scandal. He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly
be convicted. Theoretically, the U.S. government is 
already designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches
through a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections. But impeachment can be seen
as an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail.

**Transcript**:
Cell membranes are structures 
of contradictions. These oily films are hundreds of times
thinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect
the delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm, 
genetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work,
and where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a
cell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something 
much more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth
to help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience,
flexibility, and functionality by combining a variety 
of floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule 
called a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar, 
electrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail
in a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick
that extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid 
external to the cell with the lipid tails 
sandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature
has the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane 
at the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication
between cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing 
chemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them 
is more complicated. That happens through a process called
endocytosis in which sections of the membrane
engulf substances and transport them into the cell
as vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned
to the cell membrane. The most complex components
of the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules 
get in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid 
bilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't
make it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch
across the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through,
like sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating
in the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's
interior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes
can help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit,
like when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us,
as it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within
the fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes
that carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might
activate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site
of an ongoing war between us and all the things
that want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic
substances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins
made by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke
giant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing
ways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge 
that saves our cells by soaking up 
the membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes 
all the functions of life possible. Without a cell membrane,
there could be no cells, and without cells,
there would be no bacteria, no parasites, no fungi, no animals, and no us.

**Transcript**:
Cell membranes are structures 
of contradictions. These oily films are hundreds of times
thinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect
the delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm, 
genetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work,
and where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a
cell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something 
much more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth
to help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience,
flexibility, and functionality by combining a variety 
of floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule 
called a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar, 
electrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail
in a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick
that extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid 
external to the cell with the lipid tails 
sandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature
has the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane 
at the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication
between cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing 
chemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them 
is more complicated. That happens through a process called
endocytosis in which sections of the membrane
engulf substances and transport them into the cell
as vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned
to the cell membrane. The most complex components
of the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules 
get in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid 
bilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't
make it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch
across the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through,
like sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating
in the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's
interior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes
can help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit,
like when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us,
as it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within
the fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes
that carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might
activate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site
of an ongoing war between us and all the things
that want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic
substances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins
made by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke
giant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing
ways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge 
that saves our cells by soaking up 
the membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes 
all the functions of life possible. Without a cell membrane,
there could be no cells, and without cells,
there would be no bacteria, no parasites, no fungi, no animals, and no us.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the concept of proteins in the cell membrane.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the movement of proteins embedded in the cell membrane. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, Question 6 discusses the primary function of transmembrane proteins in the cell membrane.

Although it's not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the role of proteins in the cell membrane.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the wording of Question 5 is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the permeability of cell membranes, and Question 5 asks about the type of molecules that can easily cross the phospholipid bilayer, which is related to the concept of selective permeability.

However, a more direct match can be found in Question 8, option C, which mentions that the fluid mosaic "combines different components to provide resilience, flexibility, and functionality to the cell membrane" and implies selective permeability, but it is not as clear as it could be.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the permeability of cell membranes. Unfortunately, there isn't a more direct match among the provided generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5, but keep in mind that the similarity is not perfect.

What makes a good horror story? Sure, you could throw 
in some hideous monsters, fountains of blood, and things jumping out from every corner, but as classic horror author
H.P. Lovecraft wrote, "The oldest and strongest
kind of fear is fear of the unknown." And writers harness that fear
not by revealing horrors, but by leaving the audience hanging
in anticipation of them. That is, in a state of suspense. The most familiar examples of suspense
come from horror films and mystery novels. What's inside the haunted mansion? Which of the dinner guests 
is the murderer? But suspense exists beyond these genres. Will the hero save the day? Will the couple get together
in the end? And what is the dark secret that causes
the main character so much pain? The key to suspense is that it sets up
a question, or several, that the audience hopes 
to get an answer to and delays that answer while maintaining
their interest and keeping them guessing. So what are some techniques you can use
to achieve this in your own writing? Limit the point of view. Instead of an omniscient narrator who can
see and relay everything that happens, tell the story from the perspective
of the characters. They may start off knowing just
as little as the audience does, and as they learn more, so do we. Classic novels, like "Dracula," for example,
are told through letters and diary entries where characters relate
what they've experienced and fear what's to come. Next, choose the right setting 
and imagery. Old mansions or castles with winding
halls and secret passageways suggest that disturbing things
are being concealed. Nighttime, fog, and storms all play
similar roles in limiting visibility and restricting characters' movements. That's why Victorian London is such
a popular setting. And even ordinary places and objects
can be made sinister as in the Gothic novel "Rebecca" where the flowers at the protagonist's
new home are described as blood red. Three: play with style and form. You can build suspense by carefully
paying attention not just to what happens but how it's conveyed and paced. Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state
of the narrator in "The Tell-Tale Heart" with fragmented sentences
that break off suddenly. And other short declarative sentences
in the story create a mix of breathless speed
and weighty pauses. On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's
cinematography is known for its use of extended
silences and shots of staircases to create a feeling of discomfort. Four: use dramatic irony. You can't just keep the audience
in the dark forever. Sometimes, suspense is best served by revealing key parts of the big secret
to the audience but not to the characters. This is a technique known 
as dramatic irony, where the mystery becomes
not what will happen but when and how 
the characters will learn. In the classic play "Oedipus Rex," the title character is unaware
that he has killed his own father and married his mother. But the audience knows, and watching
Oedipus gradually learn the truth provides the story 
with its agonizing climax. And finally, the cliffhanger. Beware of overusing this one. Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,
but it's hard to deny its effectiveness. This is where a chapter, episode,
volume, or season cuts off right before something
crucial is revealed, or in the midst of a dangerous situation
with a slim chance of hope. The wait, whether moments or years, makes us imagine possibilities about
what could happen next, building extra suspense. The awful thing is almost always averted, creating a sense of closure 
and emotional release. But that doesn't stop us from worrying
and wondering the next time the protagonists face 
near-certain disaster.

**Transcript**:
What makes a good horror story? Sure, you could throw 
in some hideous monsters, fountains of blood, and things jumping out from every corner, but as classic horror author
H.P. Lovecraft wrote, "The oldest and strongest
kind of fear is fear of the unknown." And writers harness that fear
not by revealing horrors, but by leaving the audience hanging
in anticipation of them. That is, in a state of suspense. The most familiar examples of suspense
come from horror films and mystery novels. What's inside the haunted mansion? Which of the dinner guests 
is the murderer? But suspense exists beyond these genres. Will the hero save the day? Will the couple get together
in the end? And what is the dark secret that causes
the main character so much pain? The key to suspense is that it sets up
a question, or several, that the audience hopes 
to get an answer to and delays that answer while maintaining
their interest and keeping them guessing. So what are some techniques you can use
to achieve this in your own writing? Limit the point of view. Instead of an omniscient narrator who can
see and relay everything that happens, tell the story from the perspective
of the characters. They may start off knowing just
as little as the audience does, and as they learn more, so do we. Classic novels, like "Dracula," for example,
are told through letters and diary entries where characters relate
what they've experienced and fear what's to come. Next, choose the right setting 
and imagery. Old mansions or castles with winding
halls and secret passageways suggest that disturbing things
are being concealed. Nighttime, fog, and storms all play
similar roles in limiting visibility and restricting characters' movements. That's why Victorian London is such
a popular setting. And even ordinary places and objects
can be made sinister as in the Gothic novel "Rebecca" where the flowers at the protagonist's
new home are described as blood red. Three: play with style and form. You can build suspense by carefully
paying attention not just to what happens but how it's conveyed and paced. Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state
of the narrator in "The Tell-Tale Heart" with fragmented sentences
that break off suddenly. And other short declarative sentences
in the story create a mix of breathless speed
and weighty pauses. On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's
cinematography is known for its use of extended
silences and shots of staircases to create a feeling of discomfort. Four: use dramatic irony. You can't just keep the audience
in the dark forever. Sometimes, suspense is best served by revealing key parts of the big secret
to the audience but not to the characters. This is a technique known 
as dramatic irony, where the mystery becomes
not what will happen but when and how 
the characters will learn. In the classic play "Oedipus Rex," the title character is unaware
that he has killed his own father and married his mother. But the audience knows, and watching
Oedipus gradually learn the truth provides the story 
with its agonizing climax. And finally, the cliffhanger. Beware of overusing this one. Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,
but it's hard to deny its effectiveness. This is where a chapter, episode,
volume, or season cuts off right before something
crucial is revealed, or in the midst of a dangerous situation
with a slim chance of hope. The wait, whether moments or years, makes us imagine possibilities about
what could happen next, building extra suspense. The awful thing is almost always averted, creating a sense of closure 
and emotional release. But that doesn't stop us from worrying
and wondering the next time the protagonists face 
near-certain disaster.

**Transcript**:
James Joyce's "Ulysses" is widely considered
to be both a literary masterpiece and one of the hardest works
of literature to read. It inspires such devotion that once a year
on a day called Bloomsday, thousands of people all over the world
dress up like the characters, take to the streets, and read the book aloud. And some even make a pilgrimage
to Dublin just to visit the places so vividly
depicted in Joyce's opus. So what is it about this famously
difficult novel that inspires so many people? There's no one simple answer
to that question, but there are a few remarkable things
about the book that keep people coming back. The plot, which transpires over
the course of a single day, is a story of three characters: Stephen Dedalus, reprised from 
Joyce's earlier novel, "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"; Leopold Bloom, a half-Jewish advertising
canvasser for a Dublin newspaper; and Bloom's wife Molly, who is about
to embark on an affair. Stephen is depressed because
of his mother's recent death. Meanwhile, Bloom wanders 
throughout the city. He goes to a funeral, his work, a pub, and so on, avoiding going home because Molly
is about to begin her affair. Where it really starts 
to get interesting, though, is how the story's told. Each chapter is written 
in a different style. 15 is a play, 13 is like a cheesy romance novel, 12 is a story with bizarre,
exaggerated interruptions, 11 uses techniques, like onomatopoeia,
repetitions, and alliteration to imitate music, and 14 reproduces the evolution
of English literary prose style, from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon
right up to the 20th century. That all culminates in the final chapter which follows Molly's 
stream of consciousness as it spools out in just 
eight long paragraphs with almost no punctuation. The range of styles
Joyce uses in "Ulysses" is one of the things 
that makes it so difficult, but it also helps make it enjoyable. And it's one of the reasons that
the book is held up as one of the key texts 
of literary modernism, a movement characterized by overturning
traditional modes of writing. Joyce fills his narrative 
gymnastic routines with some of the most imaginative 
use of language you'll find anywhere. Take, for instance, "The figure seated on a large boulder 
at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested 
stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed 
largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged
ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero." Here, Joyce exaggerates the description
of a mangy old man in a pub to make him seem like an improbably
gigantesque hero. It's true that some sections 
are impenetrably dense at first glance, but it's up to the reader 
to let their eyes skim over them or break out a shovel and dig in. And once you start excavating the text, you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic
treasure trove. It's filled with all manner of references
and allusions from medieval philosophy
to the symbolism of tattoos, and from Dante to Dublin slang. As suggested by the title, some of these
allusions revolve around Homer's "Odyssey." Each chapter is named after a character
or episode from the "Odyssey," but the literary references are often
coy, debatable, sarcastic, or disguised. For example, Homer's Odysseus,
after an epic 20-year-long journey, returns home to Ithaca
and reunites with his faithful wife. In contrast, Joyce's Bloom
wanders around Dublin for a day and returns home to his unfaithful wife. It's a very funny book. It has highbrow intellectual humor, if you have the patience to track down
Joyce's references, and more lowbrow dirty jokes. Those, and other sexual references,
were too much for some. In the U.S., the book was put on trial,
banned, and censored before it had even been completed because it was originally published
as a serial novel. Readers of "Ulysses" aren't just led
through a variety of literary styles. They're also given a rich 
and shockingly accurate tour of a specific place at a time: Dublin in 1904. Joyce claimed that if Dublin
were to be destroyed, it could be recreated from the pages
of this book. While such a claim is not exactly true, it does show the great care that Joyce
took in precisely representing details, both large and small, of his home city. No small feat considering he wrote
the entire novel while living outside 
of his native Ireland. It's a testament to Joyce's genius
that "Ulysses" is a difficult book. Some people find it impenetrable
without a full book of annotations to help them understand what Joyce
is even talking about. But there's a lot of joy to be found
in reading it, more than just unpacking allusions
and solving puzzles. And if it's difficult, 
or frustrating, or funny, that's because life is all that, and more. Responding to some criticism
of "Ulysses," and there was a lot 
when it was first published, Joyce said that if "Ulysses"
isn't worth reading, then life isn't worth living.

eight long paragraphs with almost no punctuation. The range of styles
Joyce uses in "Ulysses" is one of the things 
that makes it so difficult, but it also helps make it enjoyable. And it's one of the reasons that
the book is held up as one of the key texts 
of literary modernism, a movement characterized by overturning
traditional modes of writing. Joyce fills his narrative 
gymnastic routines with some of the most imaginative 
use of language you'll find anywhere. Take, for instance, "The figure seated on a large boulder 
at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested 
stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed 
largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged
ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero." Here, Joyce exaggerates the description
of a mangy old man in a pub to make him seem like an improbably
gigantesque hero. It's true that some sections 
are impenetrably dense at first glance, but it's up to the reader 
to let their eyes skim over them or break out a shovel and dig in. And once you start excavating the text, you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic
treasure trove. It's filled with all manner of references
and allusions from medieval philosophy
to the symbolism of tattoos, and from Dante to Dublin slang. As suggested by the title, some of these
allusions revolve around Homer's "Odyssey." Each chapter is named after a character
or episode from the "Odyssey," but the literary references are often
coy, debatable, sarcastic, or disguised. For example, Homer's Odysseus,
after an epic 20-year-long journey, returns home to Ithaca
and reunites with his faithful wife. In contrast, Joyce's Bloom
wanders around Dublin for a day and returns home to his unfaithful wife. It's a very funny book. It has highbrow intellectual humor, if you have the patience to track down
Joyce's references, and more lowbrow dirty jokes. Those, and other sexual references,
were too much for some. In the U.S., the book was put on trial,
banned, and censored before it had even been completed because it was originally published
as a serial novel. Readers of "Ulysses" aren't just led
through a variety of literary styles. They're also given a rich 
and shockingly accurate tour of a specific place at a time: Dublin in 1904. Joyce claimed that if Dublin
were to be destroyed, it could be recreated from the pages
of this book. While such a claim is not exactly true, it does show the great care that Joyce
took in precisely representing details, both large and small, of his home city. No small feat considering he wrote
the entire novel while living outside 
of his native Ireland. It's a testament to Joyce's genius
that "Ulysses" is a difficult book. Some people find it impenetrable
without a full book of annotations to help them understand what Joyce
is even talking about. But there's a lot of joy to be found
in reading it, more than just unpacking allusions
and solving puzzles. And if it's difficult, 
or frustrating, or funny, that's because life is all that, and more. Responding to some criticism

**Transcript**:
James Joyce's "Ulysses" is widely considered
to be both a literary masterpiece and one of the hardest works
of literature to read. It inspires such devotion that once a year
on a day called Bloomsday, thousands of people all over the world
dress up like the characters, take to the streets, and read the book aloud. And some even make a pilgrimage
to Dublin just to visit the places so vividly
depicted in Joyce's opus. So what is it about this famously
difficult novel that inspires so many people? There's no one simple answer
to that question, but there are a few remarkable things
about the book that keep people coming back. The plot, which transpires over
the course of a single day, is a story of three characters: Stephen Dedalus, reprised from 
Joyce's earlier novel, "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"; Leopold Bloom, a half-Jewish advertising
canvasser for a Dublin newspaper; and Bloom's wife Molly, who is about
to embark on an affair. Stephen is depressed because
of his mother's recent death. Meanwhile, Bloom wanders 
throughout the city. He goes to a funeral, his work, a pub, and so on, avoiding going home because Molly
is about to begin her affair. Where it really starts 
to get interesting, though, is how the story's told. Each chapter is written 
in a different style. 15 is a play, 13 is like a cheesy romance novel, 12 is a story with bizarre,
exaggerated interruptions, 11 uses techniques, like onomatopoeia,
repetitions, and alliteration to imitate music, and 14 reproduces the evolution
of English literary prose style, from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon
right up to the 20th century. That all culminates in the final chapter which follows Molly's 
stream of consciousness as it spools out in just 
eight long paragraphs with almost no punctuation. The range of styles
Joyce uses in "Ulysses" is one of the things 
that makes it so difficult, but it also helps make it enjoyable. And it's one of the reasons that
the book is held up as one of the key texts 
of literary modernism, a movement characterized by overturning
traditional modes of writing. Joyce fills his narrative 
gymnastic routines with some of the most imaginative 
use of language you'll find anywhere. Take, for instance, "The figure seated on a large boulder 
at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested 
stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed 
largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged
ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero." Here, Joyce exaggerates the description
of a mangy old man in a pub to make him seem like an improbably
gigantesque hero. It's true that some sections 
are impenetrably dense at first glance, but it's up to the reader 
to let their eyes skim over them or break out a shovel and dig in. And once you start excavating the text, you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic

**Transcript**:
What if electricity could travel forever
without being diminished? What if a computer could run exponentially
faster with perfect accuracy? What technology could 
those abilities build? We may be able to find out thanks 
to the work of the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize 
in Physics in 2016. David Thouless, Duncan Haldane, and Michael Kosterlitz won the award
for discovering that even microscopic matter
at the smallest scale can exhibit macroscopic properties
and phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch
of mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties
of objects. Topological properties don't change when
an object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached
in new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same
to a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut 
into a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand, 
a pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes
that will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear
whether topology was useful for describing the behaviors
of subatomic particles. That's because particles,
like electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws
of quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see 
at the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered
that topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize
materials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties
lend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics
to some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called 
a topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field
passes through them, each electron will start traveling
in a circle, which is called
a closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck
in these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected,
and they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump
from one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material
conducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected
by small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole
in the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator
has perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways
can even be controlled. The electronics of the future 
could be built to use this perfectly efficient
electron highway. The topological properties 
of subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers 
take advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be 
in different states at the same time to store information in something
called qubits. These qubits can solve problems
exponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data
is so delicate that interaction with the environment
can destroy it. But in some exotic topological phases, the subatomic particles 
can become protected. In other words, the qubits formed by them can't be changed by small 
or local disturbances. These topological qubits 
would be more stable, leading to more accurate computation
and a better quantum computer. Topology was originally studied as
a branch of purely abstract mathematics. Thanks to the pioneering work
of Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz, we now know it can be used to understand
the riddles of nature and to revolutionize 
the future of technologies.

and phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch
of mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties
of objects. Topological properties don't change when
an object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached
in new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same
to a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut 
into a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand, 
a pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes
that will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear
whether topology was useful for describing the behaviors
of subatomic particles. That's because particles,
like electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws
of quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see 
at the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered
that topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize
materials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties
lend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics
to some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called 
a topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field
passes through them, each electron will start traveling
in a circle, which is called
a closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck
in these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected,
and they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump
from one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material
conducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected
by small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole
in the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator
has perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways
can even be controlled. The electronics of the future 
could be built to use this perfectly efficient
electron highway. The topological properties 
of subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers 
take advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be 
in different states at the same time to store information in something
called qubits. These qubits can solve problems
exponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data
is so delicate that interaction with the environment
can destroy it. But in some exotic topological phases, the subatomic particles 
can become protected. In other words, the qubits formed by them can't be changed by small 
or local disturbances. These topological qubits 
would be more stable, leading to more accurate computation
and a better quantum computer. Topology was originally studied as
a branch of purely abstract mathematics. Thanks to the pioneering work
of Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz, we now know it can be used to understand
the riddles of nature and to revolutionize 
the future of technologies.

**Transcript**:
In 19 B.C., the Roman poet Virgil
was traveling from Greece to Rome with the emperor Augustus. On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing
in Megara, a town in Greece. Out in the sun for too long,
he suffered heatstroke and died on his journey back to Italy. On his deathbed, Virgil thought about the manuscript 
he had been working on for over ten years, an epic poem that he called the "Aeneid." Unsatisfied with the final edit,
he asked his friends to burn it, but they refused, and soon after Virgil's death,
Augustus ordered it to be published. Why was Augustus so interested
in saving Virgil's poem? The Romans had little tradition
of writing serious literature and Virgil wanted to create a poem to rival the "Iliad"
and "Odyssey" of Ancient Greece. The "Aeneid," a 9,896 line poem,
spans twelve separate sections, or books, the first six of which mirror
the structure of the "Odyssey" and the last six echo the "Iliad." Also like the Greek epics, The "Aeneid" is written entirely
in dactylic hexameter. In this meter, each line 
has six syllable groups called feet made up of dactyls which go
long, short, short, and spondees which go long, long. So the famous opening line
in the original Latin starts, "Arma Virvmqve Cano," which can be translated as
"I sing of arms and the man," arms, meaning battles and warfare,
another "Iliad" reference, and the man being the hero Aeneas. To understand the "Aeneid," it's necessary to examine the unsettled
nature of Roman politics in the second half of the 1st century B.C. In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar, 
Augustus's great uncle, triggered nearly 20 years of civil war when he led his army 
against the Roman Republic. After introducing a dictatorship,
he was assassinated. Only after Augustus's victory
over Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C. did peace return to Rome and Augustus became the emperor. Virgil aimed to capture this sense
of a new era and of the great sacrifices
that the Romans had endured. He wanted to give the Romans
a fresh sense of their origins, their past, and their potential. By connecting the founding of Rome to the mythological stories
that his audience knew so well, Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas
to the character of Augustus. In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest
to establish a new home for his people. This duty, or pietas 
as the Romans called it, faces all kinds of obstacles. Aeneas risks destruction 
in the ruins of Troy, agonizes over love when he meets
the beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido, and in one of the most vivid passages
in all of ancient literature, has to pass through the underworld. On top of all that, he must then
fight to win a homeland for his people around the future sight of Rome. Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model
for Augustus, and that's probably one of the reasons
the emperor was so eager to save the poem from destruction. But Virgil didn't stop there. In some sections, Aeneas even has visions
of Rome's future and of Augustus himself. Virgil presents Augustus as a victor,
entering Rome in triumph and shows him expanding 
the Roman Empire. Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as
only the third Roman leader in 700 years to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus
signifying the arrival of permanent peace. But there's a twist. Virgil only read Augustus three
selected extracts of the story and that was Augustus's 
entire exposure to it. Some of the other sections
could be seen as critical, if not subtly subversive
about the emperor's achievements. Aeneas, again a model for Augustus,
struggles with his duty and often seems a reluctant hero. He doesn't always live up to the
behavior expected of a good Roman leader. He struggles to balance mercy and justice. By the end, the reader is left wondering
about the future of Rome and the new government of Augustus. Perhaps in wanting the story published, Augustus had been fooled
by his own desire for self-promotion. As a result, Virgil's story has survived
to ask questions about the nature of power
and authority ever since.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How long had Virgil been writing the "Aeneid" when he died?
Options: A. 1 year, B. 2 years, C. 5 years, D. 10 years
Correct Option: D

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 19 B.C., the Roman poet Virgil
was traveling from Greece to Rome with the emperor Augustus. On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing
in Megara, a town in Greece. Out in the sun for too long,
he suffered heatstroke and died on his journey back to Italy. On his deathbed, Virgil thought about the manuscript 
he had been working on for over ten years, an epic poem that he called the "Aeneid." Unsatisfied with the final edit,
he asked his friends to burn it, but they refused, and soon after Virgil's death,
Augustus ordered it to be published. Why was Augustus so interested
in saving Virgil's poem? The Romans had little tradition
of writing serious literature and Virgil wanted to create a poem to rival the "Iliad"
and "Odyssey" of Ancient Greece. The "Aeneid," a 9,896 line poem,
spans twelve separate sections, or books, the first six of which mirror
the structure of the "Odyssey" and the last six echo the "Iliad." Also like the Greek epics, The "Aeneid" is written entirely
in dactylic hexameter. In this meter, each line 
has six syllable groups called feet made up of dactyls which go
long, short, short, and spondees which go long, long. So the famous opening line
in the original Latin starts, "Arma Virvmqve Cano," which can be translated as
"I sing of arms and the man," arms, meaning battles and warfare,
another "Iliad" reference, and the man being the hero Aeneas. To understand the "Aeneid," it's necessary to examine the unsettled
nature of Roman politics in the second half of the 1st century B.C. In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar, 
Augustus's great uncle, triggered nearly 20 years of civil war when he led his army 
against the Roman Republic. After introducing a dictatorship,
he was assassinated. Only after Augustus's victory
over Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C. did peace return to Rome and Augustus became the emperor. Virgil aimed to capture this sense
of a new era and of the great sacrifices
that the Romans had endured. He wanted to give the Romans
a fresh sense of their origins, their past, and their potential. By connecting the founding of Rome to the mythological stories
that his audience knew so well, Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas
to the character of Augustus. In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest
to establish a new home for his people. This duty, or pietas 
as the Romans called it, faces all kinds of obstacles. Aeneas risks destruction 
in the ruins of Troy, agonizes over love when he meets
the beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido, and in one of the most vivid passages
in all of ancient literature, has to pass through the underworld. On top of all that, he must then
fight to win a homeland for his people around the future sight of Rome. Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model
for Augustus, and that's probably one of the reasons
the emperor was so eager to save the poem from destruction. But Virgil didn't stop there. In some sections, Aeneas even has visions
of Rome's future and of Augustus himself. Virgil presents Augustus as a victor,
entering Rome in triumph and shows him expanding 
the Roman Empire. Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as
only the third Roman leader in 700 years to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus
signifying the arrival of permanent peace. But there's a twist. Virgil only read Augustus three
selected extracts of the story and that was Augustus's 
entire exposure to it. Some of the other sections
could be seen as critical, if not subtly subversive
about the emperor's achievements. Aeneas, again a model for Augustus,
struggles with his duty and often seems a reluctant hero. He doesn't always live up to the
behavior expected of a good Roman leader. He struggles to balance mercy and justice. By the end, the reader is left wondering
about the future of Rome and the new government of Augustus. Perhaps in wanting the story published, Augustus had been fooled
by his own desire for self-promotion. As a result, Virgil's story has survived
to ask questions about the nature of power
and authority ever since.

- Correct Answer Matching Score: 1.0000 (The correct answer option in the generated question matches the ground truth answer, as "pietas" indeed refers to duty or responsibility.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.8000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible, but not as strong as those in the ground truth question. Options B and C, "Dharma" and "Karma", are concepts from different cultures and might not be immediately recognizable as incorrect in this context. Option D, "Honor", is a bit more plausible as a synonym for duty, but still not as strong as the distractors in the ground truth question.)

**Transcript**:
Imagine setting sail 
from Hawaii in a canoe. Your target is a small island thousands
of kilometers away in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's a body of water that covers
more than 160 million square kilometers, greater than all the landmasses 
on Earth combined. For thousands of years, Polynesian navigators managed voyages 
like this without the help 
of modern navigational aids. Ancient Polynesians used the Sun, Moon, stars, planets, ocean currents, and clouds as guides that allowed them
to see the ocean as a series of pathways rather than an obstacle. Their voyages began around 1500 B.C. when the people who would settle Polynesia
first set sail from Southeast Asia. Early Polynesians eventually settled
a vast area of islands spread over 40 million square kilometers
of the Pacific Ocean. Some historians believe the voyagers moved
from place to place to avoid overpopulation. Others, that they were driven by war. Voyages became less frequent
by around 1300 A.D. as Polynesian societies became more rooted
in specific locations. During the voyaging period, successful journeys depended on 
a number of factors: well-built canoes, the skill of navigators, and weather being some of the biggest. Voyages relied on sturdy wa'a kaulua,
or double-hulled canoes, which were powered by sails
and steered with a single large oar. Canoe building involved
the whole community, bringing together the navigators, canoe builders, priests, chanters, and hula dancers. Navigators were keen observers 
of the natural world. They were abundantly familiar with 
trade wind-generated ocean swells, which typically flow 
northeast or southeast. By day, navigators could 
identify direction by the rocking motion of their canoes
caused by these swells. But sunrise and sunset 
were even more useful. The Sun's position indicated east and west and created low light on the ocean that
made it possible to see swells directly. At night, navigators used something 
called a star compass, which wasn't a physical object,
but rather a sort of mental map. They memorized the rising and setting
points of stars and constellations at different times of the year. They used those to divide the sky
into four quadrants, subdivided into 32 houses, with the canoe in the middle. So, for example, when they saw the star
Pira‘atea rising from the ocean, they knew that to be northeast. They had some other tricks, too. The Earth's axis points towards Hokupa'a,
or the North Star, so called because it's the one fixed
point in the sky as the Earth rotates and always indicates north. However, it's not visible 
south of the Equator, so navigators there could use
a constellation called Newe, or the Southern Cross, and some mental tricks to estimate
where south is. For instance, draw a line through
these two stars, extend it 4.5 times, and draw another line 
from there to the horizon. That's south. But the sky also contains 
navigational aids much closer to Earth, the clouds. Besides being useful weather cues, under the right conditions, 
they can indicate landmasses. For instance, the lagoons 
of Pacific atolls can actually be seen reflected
on the underside of clouds, if you know what to look for. And high masses of clouds can indicate
mountainous islands. Once navigators neared their destination,
other clues, such as the flight patterns of birds, floating debris or vegetation, and types of fish in the area helped
determine the proximity of land. For example, the Manu-O-Ku had a known
flight range of 190 kilometers, and could be followed back to shore. So how do we know all of this? Partially through evidence in petroglyphs, written observations 
of European explorers, and Polynesian oral traditions. But also by trying them out for ourselves. In 2017, a voyaging canoe called Hokulea completed a worldwide voyage 
using only these techniques. If that seems remarkable,
remember the ancient Polynesians, who through close study 
and kinship with nature, were able to forge these paths across an unfathomably vast, 
vibrant living ocean.

**Transcript**:
Imagine setting sail 
from Hawaii in a canoe. Your target is a small island thousands
of kilometers away in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's a body of water that covers
more than 160 million square kilometers, greater than all the landmasses 
on Earth combined. For thousands of years, Polynesian navigators managed voyages 
like this without the help 
of modern navigational aids. Ancient Polynesians used the Sun, Moon, stars, planets, ocean currents, and clouds as guides that allowed them
to see the ocean as a series of pathways rather than an obstacle. Their voyages began around 1500 B.C. when the people who would settle Polynesia
first set sail from Southeast Asia. Early Polynesians eventually settled
a vast area of islands spread over 40 million square kilometers
of the Pacific Ocean. Some historians believe the voyagers moved
from place to place to avoid overpopulation. Others, that they were driven by war. Voyages became less frequent
by around 1300 A.D. as Polynesian societies became more rooted
in specific locations. During the voyaging period, successful journeys depended on 
a number of factors: well-built canoes, the skill of navigators, and weather being some of the biggest. Voyages relied on sturdy wa'a kaulua,
or double-hulled canoes, which were powered by sails
and steered with a single large oar. Canoe building involved
the whole community, bringing together the navigators, canoe builders, priests, chanters, and hula dancers. Navigators were keen observers 
of the natural world. They were abundantly familiar with 
trade wind-generated ocean swells, which typically flow 
northeast or southeast. By day, navigators could 
identify direction by the rocking motion of their canoes
caused by these swells. But sunrise and sunset 
were even more useful. The Sun's position indicated east and west and created low light on the ocean that
made it possible to see swells directly. At night, navigators used something 
called a star compass, which wasn't a physical object,
but rather a sort of mental map. They memorized the rising and setting
points of stars and constellations at different times of the year. They used those to divide the sky
into four quadrants, subdivided into 32 houses, with the canoe in the middle. So, for example, when they saw the star
Pira‘atea rising from the ocean, they knew that to be northeast. They had some other tricks, too. The Earth's axis points towards Hokupa'a,
or the North Star, so called because it's the one fixed
point in the sky as the Earth rotates and always indicates north. However, it's not visible 
south of the Equator, so navigators there could use
a constellation called Newe, or the Southern Cross, and some mental tricks to estimate
where south is. For instance, draw a line through
these two stars, extend it 4.5 times, and draw another line 
from there to the horizon. That's south. But the sky also contains 
navigational aids much closer to Earth, the clouds. Besides being useful weather cues, under the right conditions, 
they can indicate landmasses. For instance, the lagoons 
of Pacific atolls can actually be seen reflected
on the underside of clouds, if you know what to look for. And high masses of clouds can indicate
mountainous islands. Once navigators neared their destination,
other clues, such as the flight patterns of birds, floating debris or vegetation, and types of fish in the area helped
determine the proximity of land. For example, the Manu-O-Ku had a known
flight range of 190 kilometers, and could be followed back to shore. So how do we know all of this? Partially through evidence in petroglyphs, written observations 
of European explorers, and Polynesian oral traditions. But also by trying them out for ourselves. In 2017, a voyaging canoe called Hokulea completed a worldwide voyage 
using only these techniques. If that seems remarkable,
remember the ancient Polynesians, who through close study 
and kinship with nature, were able to forge these paths across an unfathomably vast, 
vibrant living ocean.

**Transcript**:
On the night of January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, 
a priest in Palermo, Italy, was mapping the stars in the sky. Over three nights, he'd look at and draw
the same set of stars, carefully measuring 
their relative positions. That night, he measured the stars. The next night, he measured them again. To his surprise, one had moved. The third night, the peculiar star
had moved again. This meant it couldn't be a star at all. It was something new, the first asteroid
ever discovered, which Piazzi eventually named Ceres. Asteroids are bits of rock and metal
that orbit the Sun. At over 900 kilometers across,
Ceres is a very large asteroid. But through a telescope, like Piazzi's, Ceres looked like a pinpoint of light
similar to a star. In fact, the word asteroid 
means star-like. You can tell the difference between stars and asteroids by 
the way they move across the sky. Of course, Piazzi knew 
none of that at the time, just that he had discovered something new. To learn about Ceres, Piazzi needed to track 
its motion across the sky and then calculate 
its orbit around the Sun. So each clear night, Piazzi
trained his telescope to the heavens. Night after night, 
he made careful measurements until finally, he couldn't. The Sun got in the way. When Piazzi first spotted Ceres,
it was here, and the Earth was here. As he tracked it each night,
the Earth and Ceres moved like this until Ceres was here. And that meant that Ceres was only
in the sky when it was daytime on Earth. During the day, bright sunlight made 
this small asteroid impossible to see. Astronomers needed to calculate
Ceres's orbit. This would let them predict where
it was going to be in the vast night sky on any given night. But the calculations were grueling
and the results imprecise. Many astronomers searched for Ceres, but not knowing exactly where to look,
no one could find it. Luckily, a hardworking mathematician
named Carl Friedrich Gauss heard about the lost asteroid. He thought it was an exciting puzzle
and went to work. When he realized he didn't have
the mathematical methods he needed, he invented new ones 
that we still use today. He derived a new orbit and new predictions
of where to look for Ceres. Hungarian astronomer
Baron Franz Xaver von Zach searched for Ceres 
with Gauss's predictions. After weeks of frustrating clouds, von Zach finally had clear skies
on December 31, 1801. He looked through his telescope
and finally saw Ceres. We haven't lost track of it since. Today, we've discovered hundreds
of thousands of asteroids. Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun
between Mars and Jupiter, while near-Earth asteroids orbit
the Sun relatively close to Earth. When we recorded this narration, astronomers had discovered 
16,407 near-Earth asteroids, but since we find 
new asteroids all the time, that number will have grown
by hundreds or thousands by the time you watch this. Today, asteroid hunters 
use modern telescopes, including one in space. Computers analyze the images, and humans check the output before reporting the asteroid observations
to an archiving center. Each discovered asteroid has its unique
orbit measured. An orbit lets astronomers predict 
where asteroids are going to be at any given time. Most asteroid trajectories can be
predicted for about 80 years though we can calculate where the best
studied asteroids will be every day between now and 
800 years into the future. We must keep searching for asteroids in case there's one out there
on a collision course with Earth. Astronomers don't only 
search for asteroids, though. They also study them 
to learn how they formed, what they're made of, and what they can tell us 
about our solar system. Today, we can do something that Piazzi
could only dream of: send spacecraft to study 
asteroids up close. One spacecraft called Dawn
journeyed billions of kilometers over four years to the main asteroid belt. There, it visited Ceres
and another asteroid, Vesta. Dawn's stunning images transformed
Piazzi's dot of light into a spectacular landscape
of craters, landslides, and mountains.

this small asteroid impossible to see. Astronomers needed to calculate
Ceres's orbit. This would let them predict where
it was going to be in the vast night sky on any given night. But the calculations were grueling
and the results imprecise. Many astronomers searched for Ceres, but not knowing exactly where to look,
no one could find it. Luckily, a hardworking mathematician
named Carl Friedrich Gauss heard about the lost asteroid. He thought it was an exciting puzzle
and went to work. When he realized he didn't have
the mathematical methods he needed, he invented new ones 
that we still use today. He derived a new orbit and new predictions
of where to look for Ceres. Hungarian astronomer
Baron Franz Xaver von Zach searched for Ceres 
with Gauss's predictions. After weeks of frustrating clouds, von Zach finally had clear skies
on December 31, 1801. He looked through his telescope
and finally saw Ceres. We haven't lost track of it since. Today, we've discovered hundreds
of thousands of asteroids. Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun
between Mars and Jupiter, while near-Earth asteroids orbit
the Sun relatively close to Earth. When we recorded this narration, astronomers had discovered 
16,407 near-Earth asteroids, but since we find 
new asteroids all the time, that number will have grown
by hundreds or thousands by the time you watch this. Today, asteroid hunters 
use modern telescopes, including one in space. Computers analyze the images, and humans check the output before reporting the asteroid observations
to an archiving center. Each discovered asteroid has its unique
orbit measured. An orbit lets astronomers predict 
where asteroids are going to be at any given time. Most asteroid trajectories can be
predicted for about 80 years though we can calculate where the best
studied asteroids will be every day between now and 
800 years into the future. We must keep searching for asteroids in case there's one out there
on a collision course with Earth. Astronomers don't only 
search for asteroids, though. They also study them 
to learn how they formed, what they're made of, and what they can tell us 
about our solar system. Today, we can do something that Piazzi
could only dream of: send spacecraft to study 
asteroids up close. One spacecraft called Dawn
journeyed billions of kilometers over four years to the main asteroid belt. There, it visited Ceres
and another asteroid, Vesta. Dawn's stunning images transformed
Piazzi's dot of light into a spectacular landscape
of craters, landslides, and mountains.

**Transcript**:
On the night of January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, 
a priest in Palermo, Italy, was mapping the stars in the sky. Over three nights, he'd look at and draw
the same set of stars, carefully measuring 
their relative positions. That night, he measured the stars. The next night, he measured them again. To his surprise, one had moved. The third night, the peculiar star
had moved again. This meant it couldn't be a star at all. It was something new, the first asteroid
ever discovered, which Piazzi eventually named Ceres. Asteroids are bits of rock and metal
that orbit the Sun. At over 900 kilometers across,
Ceres is a very large asteroid. But through a telescope, like Piazzi's, Ceres looked like a pinpoint of light
similar to a star. In fact, the word asteroid 
means star-like. You can tell the difference between stars and asteroids by 
the way they move across the sky. Of course, Piazzi knew 
none of that at the time, just that he had discovered something new. To learn about Ceres, Piazzi needed to track 
its motion across the sky and then calculate 
its orbit around the Sun. So each clear night, Piazzi
trained his telescope to the heavens. Night after night, 
he made careful measurements until finally, he couldn't. The Sun got in the way. When Piazzi first spotted Ceres,
it was here, and the Earth was here. As he tracked it each night,
the Earth and Ceres moved like this until Ceres was here. And that meant that Ceres was only
in the sky when it was daytime on Earth. During the day, bright sunlight made 
this small asteroid impossible to see. Astronomers needed to calculate
Ceres's orbit. This would let them predict where
it was going to be in the vast night sky on any given night. But the calculations were grueling

**Transcript**:
In 1879, amateur archaeologist
Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola and his young daughter Maria
explored a dark cave in Northern Spain. When Maria wondered off by herself,
she made an amazing discovery. They were standing inside 
a site of ancient art, the walls and roofs decorated with
prehistoric paintings and engravings, ranging from 19,000 to 35,000 years old. Similar marks of our ancestors have been
preserved in caves all over the world. The oldest we've found were made up to
40,000 years ago. What do these images tell us
about the ancient human mind and the lives of their creators? These early artists mixed minerals, clay,
charcoal, and ochre with spit or animal fat to create paint. They drew with their hands and tools,
like pads of moss, twigs, bones, and hair. In many instances, their images follow
the contours of the cave to create depth and shade. The most common depictions
are of geometric shapes, followed by large mammals, like bison,
horses, mammoths, deer, and boars. Human figures appear rarely,
as well as occasional hand prints. Some have theorized that these artworks
are the creation of hunters, or of holy men in trance-like states. And we've found examples created by
men, women, and even children. And why did they create this art? Perhaps they were documenting 
what they knew about the natural world, like modern scientists, or marking their tribal territory. Maybe the images were the culmination
of sacred hunting rituals or spiritual journeys. Or could they be art for art's sake,
the sheer joy and fulfillment of creation? As with many unsolved mysteries
of the ancient world, we may never know for sure, barring the invention 
of a time machine, that is. But while the answers remain elusive, these images are our earliest proof
of human communication, testifying to the human capacity 
for creativity thousands of years before writing. They are a distinct visual language 
that imagines the world outside the self, just like modern art forms, from graffiti and painting
to animated virtual-reality caves.

**Transcript**:
In 1879, amateur archaeologist
Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola and his young daughter Maria
explored a dark cave in Northern Spain. When Maria wondered off by herself,
she made an amazing discovery. They were standing inside 
a site of ancient art, the walls and roofs decorated with
prehistoric paintings and engravings, ranging from 19,000 to 35,000 years old. Similar marks of our ancestors have been
preserved in caves all over the world. The oldest we've found were made up to
40,000 years ago. What do these images tell us
about the ancient human mind and the lives of their creators? These early artists mixed minerals, clay,
charcoal, and ochre with spit or animal fat to create paint. They drew with their hands and tools,
like pads of moss, twigs, bones, and hair. In many instances, their images follow
the contours of the cave to create depth and shade. The most common depictions
are of geometric shapes, followed by large mammals, like bison,
horses, mammoths, deer, and boars. Human figures appear rarely,
as well as occasional hand prints. Some have theorized that these artworks
are the creation of hunters, or of holy men in trance-like states. And we've found examples created by
men, women, and even children. And why did they create this art? Perhaps they were documenting 
what they knew about the natural world, like modern scientists, or marking their tribal territory. Maybe the images were the culmination
of sacred hunting rituals or spiritual journeys. Or could they be art for art's sake,
the sheer joy and fulfillment of creation? As with many unsolved mysteries
of the ancient world, we may never know for sure, barring the invention 
of a time machine, that is. But while the answers remain elusive, these images are our earliest proof

**Transcript**:
Why is it so difficult to cure cancer? We've harnessed electricity, sequenced the human genome, and eradicated small pox. But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease
that affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. Cancer arises as normal cells
accumulate mutations. Most of the time, 
cells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous
cells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues, or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable
once they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types and we don't have a magic bullet
that can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include 
a combination of surgery to remove tumors and radiation and chemotherapy
to kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored
for a specific type of cancer are sometimes used, too. In many cases, 
these treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective
100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures
for all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few
of the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, we need new, better ways
of studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed
using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us
critical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity
of a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs,
which work on these lab-grown cells, will fail in clinical trials 
with real patients. One of the complexities 
of aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations
of slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations
accumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor,
giving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors
called glioblastomas can have as many as six different 
subclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because
a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic 
interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly 
communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form
blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact 
with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing 
or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down
these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing 
a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate
cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem 
to have special properties that make them resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor
shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell
could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target
these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers 
from coming back. Even if we solved those problems,
we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular
characteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation
or chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively
switch on protective shields against whatever's attacking them
by changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems
that constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find
experimental systems that match their complexity, and monitoring and treatment options
that can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is 
we're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate 
for most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s
and is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives
us one more tool to add to our arsenal.

**Transcript**:
Why is it so difficult to cure cancer? We've harnessed electricity, sequenced the human genome, and eradicated small pox. But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease
that affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. Cancer arises as normal cells
accumulate mutations. Most of the time, 
cells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous
cells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues, or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable
once they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types and we don't have a magic bullet
that can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include 
a combination of surgery to remove tumors and radiation and chemotherapy
to kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored
for a specific type of cancer are sometimes used, too. In many cases, 
these treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective
100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures
for all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few
of the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, we need new, better ways
of studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed
using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us
critical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity
of a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs,
which work on these lab-grown cells, will fail in clinical trials 
with real patients. One of the complexities 
of aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations
of slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations
accumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor,
giving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors
called glioblastomas can have as many as six different 
subclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because
a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic 
interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly 
communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form
blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact 
with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing 
or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down
these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing 
a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate
cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem 
to have special properties that make them resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor
shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell
could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target
these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers 
from coming back. Even if we solved those problems,
we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular
characteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation
or chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively
switch on protective shields against whatever's attacking them
by changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems
that constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find
experimental systems that match their complexity, and monitoring and treatment options
that can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is 
we're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate 
for most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s
and is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives
us one more tool to add to our arsenal.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Let's say there's a disaster that sends
humanity back to the Stone Age. Can our knowledge and history survive? The printed page will decompose. Hard drive storage will deteriorate. Even stones will eventually crumble. But we might have something inside us that
can outlast these physical limitations: deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA already stores 
our biological information. From eye color to skin tone,
it programs our entire bodies. DNA is made of four organic bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, or A, G, C, and T. The specific sequence of these bases
into groups of three, known as codons, gives our cells instructions to make
each of the proteins in our bodies. But this code can 
be used for other things, too, like secret messages. In 1999, scientists in New York
created an alphabet in which each of the 64 
possible DNA codons substituted for a specific letter,
number, or grammar symbol. They spliced a 22-character message
into a long strand of DNA and surrounded it with specific
genetic markers. They then hid the DNA over a period
in a type-written letter with only a small smudge
to give the location away. They mailed the letter back to themselves. Then they examined the letter
looking for the DNA strand. Once the DNA strand was located,
they found the genetic markers. Then, they sequenced the DNA
and successfully decoded the message. It soon became obvious 
that DNA cryptography could code for much more
than simple text. By translating the 1's and 0's
of binary code into DNA codons, digital data could be programmed
into synthetic DNA, then decoded back into its original form. In 2012, UK scientists encoded
739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands, including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets and an excerpt from Martin 
Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech. And four years later, researchers at
Microsoft and the University of Washington broke that record. They used binary coding to capture
a whopping 200 megabytes of data, including the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and a high-def OK Go music video, all in strings of DNA. As far as storage capacity goes, DNA stands out because of the surprising
amount of information it can hold in so little space. The current theoretical limit 
of DNA'S storage capacity is so high that you could fit 100 million HD movies
on a pencil eraser. It's even conceivable that one day
we could fit all of the information currently on the Internet into the space of a shoe box. Also, computers and the magnetic tape and
discs that their information is stored on only last for a few decades, at most,
before degrading and becoming unreliable. Meanwhile, DNA 
has a half-life of 500 years, meaning that's how long it takes
for half of its bonds to break. And if left in a cold 
and dark environment, DNA could potentially last
for hundreds of thousands of years. And if that isn't long enough, scientists experimented with having
synthetic DNA auto-reproduce. After creating their own strands of DNA that spelled out the lyrics to
the children's song "It's a Small World," they placed them into the genome of
a microbe nicknamed Conan the Bacterium. Conan belongs to a species 
which can survive in a vacuum, or without water, for six years, or come out unscathed after being
exposed to a dose of radiation 1,000 times that which would kill a human. According to the experiment, the bacterium was able to reproduce at
least 100 generations without data loss. Theoretically, if the organism
had redundant copies of the information that could be used to automatically
correct mistakes, the information could stay
preserved even longer. So one day, you might be able to create
a living, growing, knowledge archive in your own backyard, and its seeds might carry
your family's history, a detailed breakdown 
of the world's political upheavals, or the sum of humanity's knowledge
into forests and across continents. Perhaps even into the 
far reaches of space. Though we might one day disappear,
perhaps our legacy can still live on, if anyone would think to find it.

739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands, including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets and an excerpt from Martin 
Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech. And four years later, researchers at
Microsoft and the University of Washington broke that record. They used binary coding to capture
a whopping 200 megabytes of data, including the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and a high-def OK Go music video, all in strings of DNA. As far as storage capacity goes, DNA stands out because of the surprising
amount of information it can hold in so little space. The current theoretical limit 
of DNA'S storage capacity is so high that you could fit 100 million HD movies
on a pencil eraser. It's even conceivable that one day
we could fit all of the information currently on the Internet into the space of a shoe box. Also, computers and the magnetic tape and
discs that their information is stored on only last for a few decades, at most,
before degrading and becoming unreliable. Meanwhile, DNA 
has a half-life of 500 years, meaning that's how long it takes
for half of its bonds to break. And if left in a cold 
and dark environment, DNA could potentially last
for hundreds of thousands of years. And if that isn't long enough, scientists experimented with having
synthetic DNA auto-reproduce. After creating their own strands of DNA that spelled out the lyrics to
the children's song "It's a Small World," they placed them into the genome of
a microbe nicknamed Conan the Bacterium. Conan belongs to a species 
which can survive in a vacuum, or without water, for six years, or come out unscathed after being
exposed to a dose of radiation 1,000 times that which would kill a human. According to the experiment, the bacterium was able to reproduce at
least 100 generations without data loss. Theoretically, if the organism
had redundant copies of the information that could be used to automatically
correct mistakes, the information could stay
preserved even longer. So one day, you might be able to create
a living, growing, knowledge archive in your own backyard, and its seeds might carry
your family's history, a detailed breakdown 
of the world's political upheavals, or the sum of humanity's knowledge
into forests and across continents. Perhaps even into the 
far reaches of space. Though we might one day disappear,
perhaps our legacy can still live on, if anyone would think to find it.

**Transcript**:
Let's say there's a disaster that sends
humanity back to the Stone Age. Can our knowledge and history survive? The printed page will decompose. Hard drive storage will deteriorate. Even stones will eventually crumble. But we might have something inside us that
can outlast these physical limitations: deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA already stores 
our biological information. From eye color to skin tone,
it programs our entire bodies. DNA is made of four organic bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, or A, G, C, and T. The specific sequence of these bases
into groups of three, known as codons, gives our cells instructions to make
each of the proteins in our bodies. But this code can 
be used for other things, too, like secret messages. In 1999, scientists in New York
created an alphabet in which each of the 64 
possible DNA codons substituted for a specific letter,
number, or grammar symbol. They spliced a 22-character message
into a long strand of DNA and surrounded it with specific
genetic markers. They then hid the DNA over a period
in a type-written letter with only a small smudge
to give the location away. They mailed the letter back to themselves. Then they examined the letter
looking for the DNA strand. Once the DNA strand was located,
they found the genetic markers. Then, they sequenced the DNA
and successfully decoded the message. It soon became obvious 
that DNA cryptography could code for much more
than simple text. By translating the 1's and 0's
of binary code into DNA codons, digital data could be programmed
into synthetic DNA, then decoded back into its original form. In 2012, UK scientists encoded
739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands, including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets and an excerpt from Martin 
Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech. And four years later, researchers at

**Transcript**:
4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians
made a surprising discovery. If they scraped the bark 
off a particular kind of tree and ate it, their pain disappeared. Little did they know that why they'd found was destined to influence 
the future course of medicine. What the Sumerians had discovered was
a precursor to the medicine known today as aspirin. Aspirin's active ingredient is found
commonly in willow trees and other wild plants, which is how it came to infuse
the medical traditions of Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and other cultures. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought 
of as the father of modern medicine, first recommended chewing willow bark
for pain relief and making willow leaf tea
to ease the pain of childbirth. But it took over 2,000 years for us to
comprehensively investigate its potential. In the mid-18th century, an Englishman named Edward Stone
ran five years of experiments, showing that willow bark crushed
into a powder and eaten could cure a fever. It took nearly another 70 years
for a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner, to finally identify and purify
the substance that made all this possible, a compound called salicin. By then, doctors were routinely
using willow bark and other salicin-rich plants,
like the herb meadowsweet, to ease pain, fever, and inflammation. But identifying the exact compound
suddenly opened up the possibility of manipulating its form. In 1853, a French chemist managed
to chemically synthesize the compound, creating a substance called
acetylsalicylic acid. Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company
Bayer found a new method and began marketing the compound
as a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of
the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was 
just Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is
Spiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with
acetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found
to ease not just pain, but also many 
inflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames 
the fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't
actually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish 
and British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts
the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission 
of pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won 
the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered
aspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding
in the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness
that affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed
by newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries
about aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners 
also demonstrated that aspirin slows production 
of thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping
of platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that
aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people
at risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots
forming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research
that suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting
and dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's 
anti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may
decrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin
from a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment. Today, we consume about 100 billion
aspirin tablets each year, and researchers continue searching
for new applications. Already, aspirin's versatility 
has transformed modern medicine, which is astounding considering
its humble beginnings in a scraping of willow bark.

**Transcript**:
4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians
made a surprising discovery. If they scraped the bark 
off a particular kind of tree and ate it, their pain disappeared. Little did they know that why they'd found was destined to influence 
the future course of medicine. What the Sumerians had discovered was
a precursor to the medicine known today as aspirin. Aspirin's active ingredient is found
commonly in willow trees and other wild plants, which is how it came to infuse
the medical traditions of Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and other cultures. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought 
of as the father of modern medicine, first recommended chewing willow bark
for pain relief and making willow leaf tea
to ease the pain of childbirth. But it took over 2,000 years for us to
comprehensively investigate its potential. In the mid-18th century, an Englishman named Edward Stone
ran five years of experiments, showing that willow bark crushed
into a powder and eaten could cure a fever. It took nearly another 70 years
for a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner, to finally identify and purify
the substance that made all this possible, a compound called salicin. By then, doctors were routinely
using willow bark and other salicin-rich plants,
like the herb meadowsweet, to ease pain, fever, and inflammation. But identifying the exact compound
suddenly opened up the possibility of manipulating its form. In 1853, a French chemist managed
to chemically synthesize the compound, creating a substance called
acetylsalicylic acid. Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company
Bayer found a new method and began marketing the compound
as a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of
the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was 
just Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is
Spiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with
acetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found
to ease not just pain, but also many 
inflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames 
the fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't
actually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish 
and British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts
the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission 
of pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won 
the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered
aspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding
in the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness
that affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed
by newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries
about aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners 
also demonstrated that aspirin slows production 
of thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping
of platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that
aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people
at risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots
forming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research
that suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting
and dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's 
anti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may
decrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin
from a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment. Today, we consume about 100 billion
aspirin tablets each year, and researchers continue searching
for new applications. Already, aspirin's versatility 
has transformed modern medicine, which is astounding considering
its humble beginnings in a scraping of willow bark.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1970’s, Erno Rubik invented the
Rubik’s cube. But that doesn’t mean knew how to solve it. It took him a few moths  to figure
it out. By the time the first World Rubik’s Cube
Championships were held in 1982, The winner -- he could solve the cube in a
little less than 23 seconds. And these days?
[news montage of collin’s record] This is world record holder Collin Burns, and
today, we find out how he did it. [TITLES] “It could last another day; it could last
another few years. The previous record lasted for just over 2 years. But with single solve,
especially, you just need to get lucky. Or at least that’s a big part of it.” Collin tends to downplay his skills but it’s
worth noting there are two types of world records.
The way speedcubing competitions work is that volunteers scramble the cubes according to
instructions that are generated by a computer, so competitors all get the same scramble. They do 5 solves and their three middle scores
are averaged. So Collin holds the world record for a single
solve. But the world record for an average score
is held by a 19-year-old in Australia. Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At
the competition where we met up with him, kids were asking him for his autograph. He’s now being sponsored by a cube company
and by a cube retailer, which are paying for him to travel internationally. And he wants
people to know, you could do this too. “The biggest misconception about cubing
is that it’s difficult, which it really isn’t.”
Pop culture treats the Rubik’s cube like some sort of IQ test, but it’s not. At least
not anymore. “Generally average is much more impressive
because you have to be consistently fast.” Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At
the competition where we met up with him, other kids were asking him for autographs.
“are you that famous cube guy?” I recently bought a cube online and it came
with instructions for beginners. And if you memorize those, you can solve the cube in
a couple minutes. It helps to understand the design of the puzzle.
At first glance, it looks like a cube made out of cubes — right, three layers of nine. But if you look closer, you’ll see there
aren’t actually any cubes here. So that tells you that the corners will always be
corners, the edges will always be edges, and the middle pieces determine the color of that
face. Speedcubers will buy special cubes. They can
lubricate them and adjust the tension. But the real key to their speed is efficiency
- they’re looking several moves ahead, and they use fewer moves to get the same result. So there are 43 quintillion possible arrangements
for the cube. A few years back, some researchers borrowed
computing power from Google to find out that any scramble can be solved in 20 moves or
less. They call it God’s Number. But humans just aren’t that good. The beginners’ method that I learned uses
100 to 200 moves. Speedcubers use more around 50 to 60 moves.
And they can do that, in part, because of the knowledge gained by the previous generation
of speedcubers. When the cube first spread around the world
back in the 80s, people had to learn through trial and error. This was happening in a lot of math departments
and campus clubs. People were discovering the cube at the same time, and they were sharing
what they learned. The method Collin uses was developed by Jessica
Fridrich, an engineering professor who was a college student at the time. It starts with a cross on one of the faces.
And that face becomes the bottom layer. Then what they do is solve the corners of the bottom
layer and the middle layer simultaneously. “So, now you can see that all of this is
solved.” And for the final layer, they’re choosing
from dozens of algorithms that they’ve memorized. And those are sequences of moves that mess
up the cube temporarily to move certain pieces into place. And then put the rest of the cube
back where it was. The Rubik’s cube has made a comeback in
recent years along with that same ethic of sharing tips and strategies. So all the resources you need are there, there’s
just one other thing. Practice! This is Collin nearly 5 years ago. world records
are not built in a day.

**Transcript**:
In 1984, an enterprising Australian doctor
named Barry Marshall decided to take a risk. Too many of his patients were complaining
of severe abdominal pain due to stomach ulcers, which are sores in the lining
of the upper intestinal tract. At the time, few effective treatments
for ulcers existed, and many sufferers required
hospitalization or even surgery. Desperate for answers, Dr. Marshall swallowed a cloudy
broth of bacteria collected from the stomach
of one of his patients. Soon, Dr. Marshall was experiencing
the same abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting. Ten days later, a camera called 
an endoscope peered inside his insides. Marshall's stomach was teeming
with the same bacteria as his patient. He'd also developed gastritis,
or severe inflammation of the stomach, the hallmark precursor of ulcers. Dr. Marshall's idea challenged a misconception 
that still persists to this day: that ulcers are caused by stress, food, or too much stomach acid. Marshall thought the culprit
was bacterial infections. Initially, his idea was considered crazy by the brightest medical 
minds on the planet. But in 2005, he and Dr. Robin Warren
received the ultimate validation when they were awarded the Nobel
Prize for medicine. Our stomachs are J-shaped organs
with surprisingly intricate ecosystems awash in hormones and chemicals. The stomach is under constant attack
by digestive enzymes, bile, proteins, microbes, and the stomach's own acid. In response, it produces bicarbonate, mucus, and phospholipids called prostaglandins to maintain the integrity
of its own lining. This delicate balance is constantly
regulated and referred to as mucosal defense. Since the mid-1800s, doctors thought
stress alone caused most stomach ulcers. Patients were given antidepressants
or tranquilizers and told to visit health spas. This belief eventually shifted
to the related notion of spicy foods and stress as culprits. Yet no convincing study has ever
demonstrated that emotional upset, psychological distress, or spicy food directly causes ulcer disease. By the mid-20th century, it was widely
accepted that excess hydrochloric acid prompted the stomach to eat itself. Fervent proponents of this idea
were referred to as the acid mafia. The biggest hole in this theory
was that antiacids only provide temporary relief. We now know that some rare ulcers are indeed caused 
by too much hydrochloric acid. But they make up less than 1%
of all cases. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren pinpointed
a spiral-shaped bacteria called Helicobacter pylori,
or H. pylori, as the real offender. H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest
and most frequent companions, having joined us at least 50,000
years ago, and now found in 50% of people. Previously, we thought the stomach
was sterile on account of it being such an acidic,
hostile environment. Yet H. pylori survives the acidic turmoil
of the stomach with a variety of features that disrupt
mucosal defense in its favor. For example, it produces an enzyme
called urease that helps protect it from 
the surrounding gastric acid. H. pylori can make over 1,500 proteins, many of which are dedicated to maximizing
its virulence. We still have unanswered questions, like why specific people develop ulcers
at particular times. However, we do know individual genetics, other medical problems, use of certain medications, smoking, and the genetic diversity 
of Helicobacter strains all play a role. In particular, certain pain medications
used to reduce inflammation in joints have been discovered to work
with H. pylori to create more severe stomach ulcers. Dr. Marshall ended up being fine after
his famous, albeit dangerous, experiment. He ingested a course of antibiotics
similar to the ones taken now for ulcers. To be treated by simple antibiotics
is a modern triumph for a disease that previously 
needed surgery. Marshall's work also reminded us that
scientific progress is not always smooth. But there's value in trusting 
your proverbial, and sometimes literal, gut.

**Transcript**:
In 1984, an enterprising Australian doctor
named Barry Marshall decided to take a risk. Too many of his patients were complaining
of severe abdominal pain due to stomach ulcers, which are sores in the lining
of the upper intestinal tract. At the time, few effective treatments
for ulcers existed, and many sufferers required
hospitalization or even surgery. Desperate for answers, Dr. Marshall swallowed a cloudy
broth of bacteria collected from the stomach
of one of his patients. Soon, Dr. Marshall was experiencing
the same abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting. Ten days later, a camera called 
an endoscope peered inside his insides. Marshall's stomach was teeming
with the same bacteria as his patient. He'd also developed gastritis,
or severe inflammation of the stomach, the hallmark precursor of ulcers. Dr. Marshall's idea challenged a misconception 
that still persists to this day: that ulcers are caused by stress, food, or too much stomach acid. Marshall thought the culprit
was bacterial infections. Initially, his idea was considered crazy by the brightest medical 
minds on the planet. But in 2005, he and Dr. Robin Warren
received the ultimate validation when they were awarded the Nobel
Prize for medicine. Our stomachs are J-shaped organs
with surprisingly intricate ecosystems awash in hormones and chemicals. The stomach is under constant attack
by digestive enzymes, bile, proteins, microbes, and the stomach's own acid. In response, it produces bicarbonate, mucus, and phospholipids called prostaglandins to maintain the integrity
of its own lining. This delicate balance is constantly
regulated and referred to as mucosal defense. Since the mid-1800s, doctors thought
stress alone caused most stomach ulcers. Patients were given antidepressants
or tranquilizers and told to visit health spas. This belief eventually shifted
to the related notion of spicy foods and stress as culprits. Yet no convincing study has ever
demonstrated that emotional upset, psychological distress, or spicy food directly causes ulcer disease. By the mid-20th century, it was widely
accepted that excess hydrochloric acid prompted the stomach to eat itself. Fervent proponents of this idea
were referred to as the acid mafia. The biggest hole in this theory
was that antiacids only provide temporary relief. We now know that some rare ulcers are indeed caused 
by too much hydrochloric acid. But they make up less than 1%
of all cases. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren pinpointed
a spiral-shaped bacteria called Helicobacter pylori,
or H. pylori, as the real offender. H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest
and most frequent companions, having joined us at least 50,000
years ago, and now found in 50% of people. Previously, we thought the stomach
was sterile on account of it being such an acidic,
hostile environment. Yet H. pylori survives the acidic turmoil
of the stomach with a variety of features that disrupt
mucosal defense in its favor. For example, it produces an enzyme
called urease that helps protect it from 
the surrounding gastric acid. H. pylori can make over 1,500 proteins, many of which are dedicated to maximizing
its virulence. We still have unanswered questions, like why specific people develop ulcers
at particular times. However, we do know individual genetics, other medical problems, use of certain medications, smoking, and the genetic diversity 
of Helicobacter strains all play a role. In particular, certain pain medications
used to reduce inflammation in joints have been discovered to work
with H. pylori to create more severe stomach ulcers. Dr. Marshall ended up being fine after
his famous, albeit dangerous, experiment. He ingested a course of antibiotics
similar to the ones taken now for ulcers. To be treated by simple antibiotics
is a modern triumph for a disease that previously 
needed surgery. Marshall's work also reminded us that
scientific progress is not always smooth. But there's value in trusting 
your proverbial, and sometimes literal, gut.

**Transcript**:
During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures.

**Transcript**:
During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules

**Transcript**:
The universe is bustling with matter
and energy. Even in the vast apparent emptiness
of intergalactic space, there's one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. That's not the mention 
a barrage of particles and electromagnetic radiation passing every which way from stars,
galaxies, and into black holes. There's even radiation left over
from the Big Bang. So is there such thing as a total
absence of everything? This isn't just a thought experiment. Empty spaces, or vacuums,
are incredibly useful. Inside our homes, 
most vacuum cleaners work by using a fan to create a low-pressure
relatively empty area that sucks matter in to fill the void. But that's far from empty. There's still plenty of matter
bouncing around. Manufacturers rely on more thorough,
sealed vacuums for all sorts of purposes. That includes vacuum-packed food
that stays fresh longer, and the vacuums inside early light bulbs
that protected filaments from degrading. These vacuums are generally created
with some version of what a vacuum cleaner does using high-powered pumps that create
enough suction to remove as many stray atoms as possible. But the best of these industrial processes tends to leave hundreds 
of millions of atoms per cubic centimeter of space. That isn't empty enough
for scientists who work on experiments, like the Large Hadron Collider, where particle beams need to circulate
at close to the speed of light for up to ten hours without hitting
any stray atoms. So how do they create a vacuum? The LHC's pipes are made of materials,
like stainless steel, that don't release any 
of their own molecules and are lined with a special coating
to absorb stray gases. Raising the temperature 
to 200 degrees Celsius burns off any moisture, and hundreds of vacuum pumps take
two weeks to trap enough gas and debris out of the pipes for the collider's
incredibly sensitive experiments. Even with all this, the Large Hadron Collider
isn't a perfect vacuum. In the emptiest places, there are still about 100,000 particles 
per cubic centimeter. But let's say an experiment like that
could somehow get every last atom out. There's still an unfathomably huge
amount of radiation all around us that can pass right through
the walls. Every second, about 50 muons
from cosmic rays, 10 million neutrinos coming directly
from the Big Bang, 30 million photons from the cosmic
microwave background, and 300 trillion neutrinos
from the Sun pass through your body. It is possible to shield
vacuum chambers with substances, including water, that absorb and reflect this radiation, except for neutrinos. Let's say you've somehow removed
all of the atoms and blocked all of the radiation. Is the space now totally empty? Actually, no. All space is filled with what 
physicists call quantum fields. What we think of as subatomic particles, electrons and photons and their relatives, are actually vibrations 
in a quantum fabric that extends throughout the universe. And because of a physical law called
the Heisenberg Principle, these fields never stop oscillating, even without any particles 
to set off the ripples. They always have some minimum fluctuation
called a vacuum fluctuation. This means they have energy,
a huge amount of it. Because Einstein's equations tell us
that mass and energy are equivalent, the quantum fluctuations in every
cubic meter of space have an energy that corresponds
to a mass of about four protons. In other words, the seemingly empty space
inside your vacuum would actually weigh a small amount. Quantum fluctuations have existed since
the earliest moments of the universe. In the moments after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded, they were amplified and stretched out
to cosmic scales. Cosmologists believe that these original
quantum fluctuations were the seeds of everything
we see today: galaxies and the entire large scale
structure of the universe, as well as planets and solar systems. They're also the center of one of the
greatest scientific mysteries of our time because according to the current theories, the quantum fluctuations 
in the vacuum of space ought to have 120 orders of magnitude
more energy than we observe. Solving the mystery of that missing energy may entirely rewrite our understanding
of physics and the universe.

from the Sun pass through your body. It is possible to shield
vacuum chambers with substances, including water, that absorb and reflect this radiation, except for neutrinos. Let's say you've somehow removed
all of the atoms and blocked all of the radiation. Is the space now totally empty? Actually, no. All space is filled with what 
physicists call quantum fields. What we think of as subatomic particles, electrons and photons and their relatives, are actually vibrations 
in a quantum fabric that extends throughout the universe. And because of a physical law called
the Heisenberg Principle, these fields never stop oscillating, even without any particles 
to set off the ripples. They always have some minimum fluctuation
called a vacuum fluctuation. This means they have energy,
a huge amount of it. Because Einstein's equations tell us
that mass and energy are equivalent, the quantum fluctuations in every
cubic meter of space have an energy that corresponds
to a mass of about four protons. In other words, the seemingly empty space
inside your vacuum would actually weigh a small amount. Quantum fluctuations have existed since
the earliest moments of the universe. In the moments after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded, they were amplified and stretched out
to cosmic scales. Cosmologists believe that these original
quantum fluctuations were the seeds of everything
we see today: galaxies and the entire large scale
structure of the universe, as well as planets and solar systems. They're also the center of one of the
greatest scientific mysteries of our time because according to the current theories, the quantum fluctuations 
in the vacuum of space ought to have 120 orders of magnitude
more energy than we observe. Solving the mystery of that missing energy may entirely rewrite our understanding
of physics and the universe.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield
have in common? They all came up with elegant
proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus
the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most
fundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings
and triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician
in the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a
thousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
lists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate 
that Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,
to make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch
a knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length
3, 4 and 5. According to the converse
of the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known 
Indian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across
the diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large
as the original one. That relationship can be derived
from the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know 
that the theorem is true for every right triangle 
on a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians
and surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules
and logic to demonstrate that a theorem
must hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed
to Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called 
proof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles
with side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
form a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles
into two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares
are a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of 
the figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles
didn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to 
the empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek
mathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon
almost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle
into two others and uses the principle that if the
corresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides
is the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions
for their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations
together and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern
for a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time
to think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square
contains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like 
to convince yourself, you could build a turntable
with three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other 
around a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water
and spin the turntable, the water from the large square
will perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more
than 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix?

**Transcript**:
What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield
have in common? They all came up with elegant
proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus
the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most
fundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings
and triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician
in the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a
thousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
lists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate 
that Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,
to make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch
a knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length
3, 4 and 5. According to the converse
of the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known 
Indian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across
the diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large
as the original one. That relationship can be derived
from the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know 
that the theorem is true for every right triangle 
on a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians
and surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules
and logic to demonstrate that a theorem
must hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed
to Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called 
proof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles
with side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
form a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles
into two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares
are a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of 
the figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles
didn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to 
the empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek
mathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon
almost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle
into two others and uses the principle that if the
corresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides
is the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions
for their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations
together and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern
for a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time
to think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square
contains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like 
to convince yourself, you could build a turntable
with three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other 
around a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water
and spin the turntable, the water from the large square
will perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more
than 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix?

**Transcript**:
[PBS Intro] This episode is supported by 23 and Me A long time ago a guy built a tomb out of
rocks so he could live in it after he died and not be dead. His son was like “Hey that’s cool” so
he built one too.. Then his son was like “Me too” so he
made a third and they were all buried there. And that’s how we got this. The pyramids of Giza. How did people who hadn’t even invented
the wheel build these things, and… why? They’re so big! They’re so precise! They’re so directionally oriented! They’re so mysterrrrrrious. At first glance they really do look out-of-this
world. Thing is, the pyramids are much older than
you probably think. They were already ancient history to people
IN ancient history, which led to some pretty wild theories about how they came to be. But pyramid technology didn’t just show
up out of nowhere. It was the end product of centuries of scientific
and cultural evolution, of people… figuring it out. And it definitely wasn’t aliens. [OPEN] Early on, Egyptians buried their dead like
we do. The desert naturally mummified some corpses,
which influenced their religious beliefs: You need to preserve the body to reach the
afterlife, and when you get there you’ll need all your stuff. Rich people’s graves had nicer stuff, and
they needed to protect their afterlife investment. First with simple mounds, and later with mud
brick “eternal houses”. Then a king named Djoser was like “Why have
one little mud mastaba when I can have six stone mastabas in a stack?” so he stacked
six stone mastabas like a mastaba boss and the age of the pyramids had begun. This was literally the first time humans had
piled stone this high. Egyptians knew totally vertical walls got
less stable as they got taller, so Djoser’s architect stacked bricks at an incline and
let gravity do the work. Step pyramid achieved! Why pyramids and not other shapes? If you want to make a big pile of blocks,
a pyramid gets you the most stability for the least material. A third of the way up, you’ve already laid
two-thirds of your stone. Halfway, you’ve placed more than 80%. Next comes Sneferu, Mr. Pyramid. He built his own step pyramid, but then decided
he wanted a smooth one instead, so they started on a second. No one had ever built one of those before,
so they made some mistakes. For starters, they built it on sand, which
is soft, they laid blocks carelessly, and it was too steep, so halfway through they
changed the slope and ended up with this. Sneferu was like “you’re not burying me
in that”, so he ordered a third pyramid! Only this time they built a solid foundation,
laid the stones in horizontal rows, and precision cut the edges. Sneferu’s motto? If at first you don’t succeed, try again,
and then try again one more time. Sneferu had experimented his way to a blueprint
for building awesome pyramids The Great Pyramid at Giza, built by his son
Khufu, took that blueprint to the next level. Khufu’s pyramid remained the tallest structure
on Earth for almost 4000 years, until some church tower in the year 1311, which fell
down, so it was tallest again until this radio antenna was finished in 1889. Khufu’s son Khafre built his pyramid right
next to dad’s, and he didn’t stop innovating. Instead of leveling the entire 46,000 square
meter footprint, he built his pyramid over a natural stone mound and only leveled the
outer edge, which was less work, duh! It’s 3 meters shorter than his dad’s,
but this higher ground creates the illusion that Khafre’s pyramid is taller. Kids, amirite? But even these seemingly perfect pyramids
weren’t without mistakes. Khafre’s had a slight twist near the top
in order to make the edges line up evenly. What’s remarkable is Egypt’s biggest stone
pyramids were the product of just three human generations, but those were generations full
of trial and error. Pyramid building continued for nearly 700
years, and like any product, efficiency started to win out over quality. Precision-cut cores were replaced by rough-cut
blocks. Kings still wrapped their pyramids in fine
white limestone, but over the next thousand years that was removed by stone stealers and
rock robbers, leaving the cheaply-produced cores to collapse into rubble, which is probably
why you’ve never heard of them. Ironically, the kings were probably disappointed
by the whole afterlife thing, but the pyramids themselves have proven to be surprisingly
resilient. Ancient is not a synonym for stupid. The world’s first skyscrapers were tombs,
and just like our own buildings, they didn’t spring up out of nowhere, they were the product
of centuries of engineering trial and error. Go back 500 years and show someone a smartphone
and they’d probably think you were a wizard. But when we look back from the present at
the ideas and failures along the way, we see that it’s not magic at all! It’s science. And if you still think aliens did it, you’re
in de-Nile. You know, the river. Stay curious.

**Transcript**:
On July 26, 1943, Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes and blocked out the Sun. Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn't an act of war. It was smog. A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog, the word "smog" was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities such as London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. This industrial smog was known to form when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories combined with moisture in the air. But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different. It was yellowish with a chemical odor. Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits: volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors and may contain elements, such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals, but others come from manmade sources, like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum. Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles releases nitrogen oxide. That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color. VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone. PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue. Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog, which is what had been plaguing LA. So why does smog affect some cities
but not others? Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution with local weather and geography. London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog. Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds and dry, warm, sunny weather. The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation. Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA, or lying in a basin, like Beijing, are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate. That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion, where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward, a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface by a slightly warmer layer above. Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore. Both forms of smog irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema, and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis. Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight and potential birth defects. Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield, making them more susceptible to insects. Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization. Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog swirling over their streets until 1952, when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths. As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956 banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city, leading to a massive reduction in smog. Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them. Smog remains a major problem
around the world. Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy experience high levels of industrial smog. Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions affect many rapidly developing cities, from Mexico City and Santiago to New Delhi and Tehran. Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it, such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time. As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier.

**Transcript**:
On July 26, 1943, Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes and blocked out the Sun. Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn't an act of war. It was smog. A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog, the word "smog" was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities such as London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. This industrial smog was known to form when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories combined with moisture in the air. But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different. It was yellowish with a chemical odor. Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits: volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors and may contain elements, such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals, but others come from manmade sources, like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum. Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles releases nitrogen oxide. That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color. VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone. PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue. Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog, which is what had been plaguing LA. So why does smog affect some cities
but not others? Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution with local weather and geography. London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog. Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds and dry, warm, sunny weather. The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation. Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA, or lying in a basin, like Beijing, are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate. That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion, where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward, a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface by a slightly warmer layer above. Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore. Both forms of smog irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema, and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis. Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight and potential birth defects. Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield, making them more susceptible to insects. Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization. Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog swirling over their streets until 1952, when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths. As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956 banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city, leading to a massive reduction in smog. Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them. Smog remains a major problem
around the world. Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy experience high levels of industrial smog. Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions affect many rapidly developing cities, from Mexico City and Santiago to New Delhi and Tehran. Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it, such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time. As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier.

for days at a time. As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier.

**Transcript**:
This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.

**Transcript**:
This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.

**Transcript**:
For most jobs, it's understood
that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be
the most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same
as actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation 
that launches a trial, which could end in conviction
or acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for
removing a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check
on royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered
the source of all government power. But for the founders 
of the American Republic, there was no higher authority
beyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in
the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers,
up to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment
can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the
power to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter
to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient 
grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote
on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes 
by a simple majority, the official is impeached
and the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment
is held in the Senate. Selected members of the House,
known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official 
and their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating
after hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president
being impeached, the chief justice 
of the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority
of two-thirds and results in automatic removal 
from power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them
from holding office in the future and open them to standard 
criminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S. 
pits an elected legislature against other democratically 
elected members of government. Therefore, to prevent the process
from being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that 
an official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes
and misdemeanors. That still leaves a lot of room 
for interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials
have split along partisan lines. But the process is generally understood to
be reserved for serious abuses of power. The first official to be impeached was
Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease
the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Since then, the House has launched
impeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual
impeachment proceedings. The eight cases that ended
in a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges. And impeachment of a sitting president
is even more rare. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton without consulting the Senate. Over a century later, Bill Clinton 
was impeached for making false statements under oath
during a sexual harassment trial. Both were ultimately acquitted
when the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority. And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached
for the Watergate scandal. He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly
be convicted. Theoretically, the U.S. government is 
already designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches
through a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections. But impeachment can be seen
as an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail.

**Transcript**:
For most jobs, it's understood
that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be
the most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same
as actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation 
that launches a trial, which could end in conviction
or acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for
removing a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check
on royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered
the source of all government power. But for the founders 
of the American Republic, there was no higher authority
beyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in
the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers,
up to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment
can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the
power to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter
to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient 
grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote
on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes 
by a simple majority, the official is impeached
and the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment
is held in the Senate. Selected members of the House,
known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official 
and their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating
after hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president
being impeached, the chief justice 
of the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority
of two-thirds and results in automatic removal 
from power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them
from holding office in the future and open them to standard 
criminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S. 
pits an elected legislature against other democratically 
elected members of government. Therefore, to prevent the process
from being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that 
an official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes
and misdemeanors. That still leaves a lot of room 
for interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials
have split along partisan lines. But the process is generally understood to
be reserved for serious abuses of power. The first official to be impeached was
Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease
the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Since then, the House has launched
impeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual
impeachment proceedings. The eight cases that ended
in a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges. And impeachment of a sitting president
is even more rare. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton without consulting the Senate. Over a century later, Bill Clinton 
was impeached for making false statements under oath
during a sexual harassment trial. Both were ultimately acquitted
when the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority. And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached
for the Watergate scandal. He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly
be convicted. Theoretically, the U.S. government is 
already designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches
through a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections. But impeachment can be seen
as an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail.

**Transcript**:
Cell membranes are structures 
of contradictions. These oily films are hundreds of times
thinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect
the delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm, 
genetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work,
and where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a
cell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something 
much more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth
to help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience,
flexibility, and functionality by combining a variety 
of floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule 
called a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar, 
electrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail
in a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick
that extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid 
external to the cell with the lipid tails 
sandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature
has the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane 
at the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication
between cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing 
chemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them 
is more complicated. That happens through a process called
endocytosis in which sections of the membrane
engulf substances and transport them into the cell
as vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned
to the cell membrane. The most complex components
of the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules 
get in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid 
bilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't
make it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch
across the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through,
like sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating
in the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's
interior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes
can help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit,
like when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us,
as it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within
the fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes
that carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might
activate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site
of an ongoing war between us and all the things
that want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic
substances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins
made by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke
giant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing
ways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge 
that saves our cells by soaking up 
the membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes 
all the functions of life possible. Without a cell membrane,
there could be no cells, and without cells,
there would be no bacteria, no parasites, no fungi, no animals, and no us.

electrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail
in a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick
that extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid 
external to the cell with the lipid tails 
sandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature
has the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane 
at the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication
between cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing 
chemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them 
is more complicated. That happens through a process called
endocytosis in which sections of the membrane
engulf substances and transport them into the cell
as vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned
to the cell membrane. The most complex components
of the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules 
get in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid 
bilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't
make it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch
across the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through,
like sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating
in the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's
interior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes
can help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit,
like when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us,
as it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within
the fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes
that carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might
activate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site
of an ongoing war between us and all the things
that want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic
substances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins
made by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke
giant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing
ways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge 
that saves our cells by soaking up 
the membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes 
all the functions of life possible. Without a cell membrane,
there could be no cells, and without cells,
there would be no bacteria, no parasites, no fungi, no animals, and no us.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Cell membranes are structures 
of contradictions. These oily films are hundreds of times
thinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect
the delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm, 
genetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work,
and where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a
cell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something 
much more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth
to help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience,
flexibility, and functionality by combining a variety 
of floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule 
called a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar, 
electrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail
in a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick
that extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid
