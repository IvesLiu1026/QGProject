[Subtitles submitted by: Zacháry Dorris] Today I want to let you in on a really neat trick that I learned from a very famous mathematician; how to subtract ∞ from ∞ to get exactly π. So for that I'll return to this blackboard here I found in the Simpsons, and I discussed in this video up there. And particularly that infinite series down there at the bottom. Okay, so it's 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5, all the way to infinity - an infinite series, with sum log 2 [ln(2)]. So that's about...0.69. What I want to do here is something that somebody discovered about 150 years ago So just, just see what I do, it's a bit of a paradox. So what I do is I take a bit more of this, and I really need the whole board, so we'll take out every fourth term, and then what's left over has odd denominator and even denominator terms, so let's separate those out, too. Now we're going to work our way in from the left, ah, pick those two guys  and put them down there, take those two guys, and put them down in the gap, take those two guys and put them down in the next gap, and you keep on going like this, and obviously when you do this, you use up all the terms that were there in the beginning, and just rearrange them here and rebracket them a little bit. Now we're going to work our way through the brackets, so first one here, (1 - 1/2) is 1/2. (1/3 - 1/6) is 1/6 And so on, right, so we can see how this works, this nice pattern here, um, that's what happens, so we've just rearranged the terms, and we rebracketed them a little bit, and that shouldn't change anything about the sum of this thing, right? So, if you compare what we've got now to what we started with, well, the bit that we started with is what? ln(2). But now we can compare term by term, so one half of 1 is 1/2. One half of 1/2 is 1/4. And half of 1/3 is 1/6, and so on, and so what you see is that term by term. The bit at the bottom here is always one half of the bit at the top, and so what it means is it should really be equal to ... 1/2*ln(2). Now if you put all this stuff together, you get ln(2) is equal to 1/2*ln(2),  which really amounts the same thing as saying that 1 is equal to 2. *groans tiredly* *laughing* and whenever you come across something like this, you start worrying. So there's really, you know, two different options here, the first one is maths is broken. Or, we made a mistake. What do you think is more likely here, well, yes, we made a mistake. So where's the mistake? So let's have a close look, so there was three different identities, so here, here, and there. So two of these are correct, and one of these is not correct. So, the first bit, well, I already said this, and just believe me, this is equal to ln(2). Then the bottom bit is also correct. In fact, that bracketing here, and I'll just say this now, you can put in brackets anywhere you want, it's not going to change anything about this sum here. It's always going to add up to 1/2*ln(2) here, that's correct. So what's really messing things up is that we are rearranging the terms, so we're changing the order of the terms. And that really creates an infinite series with a different sum than the one before. So basically when we're dealing with these infinite series, unlike with the finite ones, order matters, and rearranging may change the sum. Okay, well some people are getting really worried oh no,  maths is broken anyway, no it's not broken - we just have to get used to this. *laughs* we gotta be careful about this sort of stuffs. So we just saw that we can rearrange this series into another series with a different sum, and actually there's a famous mathematician, Riemann, Bernhard Riemann, who came up with a theorem, the Riemann rearrangement theorem, which says that, well, in this case of this particular series, you can rearrange this thing into series that add up to anything you want. For example, π, and I'm going to show you how that is done, how he...how he makes up these different sums. Now you've probably heard this name, the Riemann hypothesis, is at the moment the most sought after thing that you can prove in mathematics. So eternal fame awaits if you can do this, and that's all about the Riemann zeta function, and there's also the Riemann integral, which you use all the time, and lots and lots of Riemann named bits in mathematics, so this guy is  a mathematical superhero. Usually, when it comes to these things that are named after him, they are quite...difficult to explain properly, but that Riemann rearrangement theorem I can do like this with my animation magic. So let's just do it, but before we do it,  I really have to remind you of what it actually means for one of those series to add up to a certain number, okay, so what we do is we translate this, series, into a sequence of numbers, the 'partial sums', the sequence of partial sums. So the first partial sum is just the first term, which is 1, the second partial sum is just those two guys added up. That's...0.5 in this case, and then, third partial sum, fourth partial sum, and so you get this sequence of numbers here, and in the case of this series, the sequence of numbers 'converges' to a certain number. which is ln(2). And then we say that this series has sum, that number, ln(2) in this case. That's the definition of a sum of an infinite series. This is an example of a 'convergent' series. A series that actually has a sum which is a finite number. Ah, now there's also lots of series that don't converge. And they are called 'divergent'. So for example, if we replace all the minuses in here by pluses, I already showed in that other video up there, that this adds up to +∞. But there's other types of divergence, For example, if we take this guy there, that's 1 - 1 + 1 - 1+... ; the partial sums here are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 They don't settle down to anything; not finite, not infinite, that's also divergent. So there are different sorts of divergent. To explain what's going on here, let's have a look at the positive terms, and the negative terms separately. So if you just add up all the positive terms, you'll actually find you get ∞. And if you actually add up the negative terms, you get -∞. And, actually if you've watched the other video you should be able to prove that yourself, and maybe do it in the comments. So what we're really doing here is we're subtracting ∞ from ∞ in a controlled manner. What Riemann's rearrangement theorem says is that if you've got a convergent series, whose positive terms add up to ∞, and whose negative terms add up to -∞, then you can rearrange the series into series that have any sum you want. So let me demonstrate this now for π, with this particular series. Okay, so we want pi. [CAPTIONER'S NOTE: Don't we all, Mathologer :)] That's positive, so we're going to start with some positive terms. So the first term of my new series is going to be 1. So the first partial sum is also going to be 1. The partial sums, I put up there. Now, that is not enough, so we add a few more of those positive terms, let's get close to π. Now we actually have to add quite a few of them to get close to π, we are still just under here, so let's add one more, and that gets us just over. This string of terms, we choose as the beginning bit of our new series. So we're just over, now we're going to use some negative terms to get just under. Okay, so we use the, actually, the -1/2 is good enough, so, that gets us under. *thoughtful pause* 2.6 and so on. *dramatic pause* Alright, now let's go over again, so for that,  we'll just use some positive terms. Um, we actually need quite a few again, but we can be absolutely sure that we can get over because, at any stage of this process, the positive terms that are left over will add up to ∞, and the negative terms that are left over will add up to ∞, so I can always be sure that no matter how far I'm under, or how far I'm over, I can always take enough terms to get under or over. Alright, now we can just keep on going like this, so then a negative term to get us under again, then a positive, positive terms again to get us over, and we go, flip back and forth, and eventually we get to π. And we can also be sure that we get to π because the terms themselves, they get smaller and smaller in magnitude, so that means that as I overshoot and undershoot, I get closer and closer to π. And actually,  uh, I can rearrange this initial series in infinitely many ways, different ways, to get me π; I can also rearrange it to get me an infinite sum, all sorts of other things, so maybe you'll also want to do this in the comments, figure out the details there. Now, for other series, you can actually have the situation where nothing changes no matter what you do. So there's lots of convergent series where the positive terms add up to a positive number and the negative terms add up to a negative number, so for example, it could be, you know, 2, the positive terms, and minus 7, the negative terms. And then, no matter how you reshuffle,  this series, the sum will always be 2 - 7 is -5. Okay, now there's something else that we're actually doing here, we're actually bracketing, alright, so we're bracketing. So we can bracket like this, we can bracket like that, or maybe we don't do any brackets whatsoever, And actually, as long as we're dealing with, infinite series, that converge, either this type or of that type, doesn't matter what, you can put in brackets wherever you want, and the sum won't change. So I mean, that's a bit reassuring *chuckles anxiously* so, basically commutativity is broken, but but, uh, associativity, at least for convergent series, doesn't get mucked up, so it's quite nice. *excited* BUT, there's at least one more surprise happening here; that's just for convergent series. So if you actually look at some divergent series, strange things can happen even when you bracket them. So for example, this guy here, the 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 divergent series, if you just bracket it right, you'll actually get a convergent series. with a certain sum, and actually you can bracket this in many, many different ways, and get different sums out. And maybe that's also a puzzle for you to sort out; how can you rebracket this thing to get different, different sums out? Well, there's really amazing things to be discovered yet, um, the first one is basically saying, and you can actually, with what I showed you today, you can actually figure out the details yourself. *deep breath* is that if I give you an arbitrary infinite series, there's three different cases; so you can ask, in how many different sums can I rearrange this thing? So the first case is, no matter how I rearrange this thing, I'll never get a sum. The second case is it rearranges in all possible...sums. And the third case is, it just is one sum, no matter how you rearrange it. Now this gets even freakier when you are considering infinite series of complex numbers, or infinite series of vectors, and you can do this in Banach spaces, and you can do this in all kinds of other things, but maybe, maybe that's um, *exhales* maybe that's enough for today.

**Transcript**:
Modern fashion trends can be... weird. I mean, skinny jeans can get a little uncomfortable,
yes. And maybe you have a friend who spends more
time waxing his mustache and trimming his beard than he does actually bathing himself. But your fashion choices probably won’t
kill, burn, or poison you. However, people haven't always been so lucky. Historically, some pretty dangerous clothing,
cosmetics, and accessories have come in vogue, endangering their wearers and makers alike. It turns out there are just some things that
you really don’t want to put on or in your body… even if everyone else is doing it. [INTRO] Let’s start in the 1700s, when skirts were
huge, cool guys wore wigs, and the hottest color in Europe was green. Specifically, two special pigments known as
Scheele’s Green and Emerald Green. In 1775, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele
developed copper arsenate, an intense, yellow-green pigment that was more brilliant and longer-lasting
than any other green dye. It was also a lot more toxic because it was
made with arsenic. German scientists soon improved on Scheele’s
recipe by inventing an even more vivid green dye -- copper acetoarsenite, commonly known
as Emerald Green or Paris Green. And society loved it. They used it to decorate everything from fake
plants to ball gowns. For fashionistas, the danger emerged when
they’d sweat through their green gloves, stockings, or socks, and transfer the toxins
to their skin. This caused chemical burns and open sores
that absorbed even more of the poison. A poisonous dust would also flake off of dyed
objects, especially wallpapers or twirling dresses as people danced at balls. If you breathed in enough arsenic, the poisoning
could cause vomiting, ulcers, nerve damage, and eventually even death. But arsenic pigments weren’t the only harmful
ones. Some of the first synthetic dyes for clothes
and shoes could cause some pretty nasty health problems all on their own. Aniline is a toxic organic compound that was
first isolated from the indigo plant in the 1820s. When ingested, it interferes with blood cells’
ability to carry oxygen. But in 1856, a chemistry student named William
Henry Perkin was trying to use aniline to create an antimalarial drug, when he accidentally
created mauveine, a bright purple dye. And soon, aniline dyes were all the rage. Their vibrant reds and deep blacks made natural
dyes look muted by comparison. But I bet you can guess what happened next. People who wore socks, gloves, and shirts
colored with aniline, or shoes that had been shined with an aniline-based polish, often
suffered inflammatory skin reactions or headaches and dizziness… because the dye was poisoning
their blood. Our next dangerous trend is more like a single
horrible incident. The culprit in this case was zinc chloride,
which wasn’t used to dye fabrics, but it was used in a coating that goes on wool to
protect the fabric. The compound had, and still has, lots of applications,
because it’s both highly corrosive and highly soluble in water. But, one day, in December 1898, over 60 men
were hired to clean the streets of Birmingham, England after a snowstorm. And they were all given new wool overcoats
to keep them warm. Nice, right? Well, most of the men ended up in the hospital,
with large patches of destroyed skin around their knees and wrists. It turns out, their coats had been treated
with an excess of zinc chloride, and when they got wet from the snow, the toxin dripped
onto their skin and caused serious chemical burns. Now, we’ve talked before about how asbestos
has been misused over the ages. But before anyone knew that asbestos equals
dying, it was often worn for protection. It can form lightweight fibers that can be
woven into fabric, and it's famously flame retardant. So, from ancient Rome until at least the early
1980s, lots of dangerous, fire-related jobs involved wearing uniforms with some amount
of asbestos in them. This was especially true for firefighters. But, asbestos fibers are incredibly dangerous
for human health. Even when they’re woven into clothing, asbestos
fibers can break off into tiny pieces that can enter the lungs. When too many fibers build up in your lungs,
they cause irritation, inflammation, and scarring, hindering the ability to absorb oxygen and
making it hard to breathe. Asbestos is also a carcinogen. People who are exposed to large amounts of
it tend to develop an otherwise-rare lung cancer called mesothelioma. So even though we were using it as protection,
asbestos was doing tremendous damage to our bodies all along. Another fabric that proved to be more harmful
than we expected is viscose rayon. In the late 1800s, chemists were looking for
an artificial substitute for natural silk, which, as sexy as it is, is incredibly time-consuming
and expensive to produce. In 1905, a British company began making a
new material: They started with a sticky solution of dissolved wood pulp, which contains lots
of the natural plant polymer cellulose. They aged it, dumped in some chemicals, and
eventually extracted fibers that looked and felt a lot like silk. We know those fibers today as rayon. One of the key steps in making viscose rayon
involved a compound called carbon disulfide, which is -- as you might guess-- highly toxic! The fabric was safe to wear, but factory workers
suffered. Prolonged exposure to carbon disulfide can
damage the cardiovascular and nervous systems. This was linked to behavioral and health problems
among workers ranging from bouts of mania to strokes. But even with these hazards, the popularity
of artificial silk kept booming, well into the 1900s. So you might know the Mad Hatter from Lewis
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland -- kind of crazy, drinks a lot of tea? Turns out, he might have some basis in reality. The phrase “mad as a hatter” was actually
used to describe industrial hat-makers in the mid-1800s, who were poisoned by mercury
just by doing their jobs. Most hats were felted, or made from the fur
of small animals. And to make felt, hatters used a process called
“carroting,” where they washed the pelts in an orange solution containing mercury nitrate
to separate the fur from the skin and shrink it into a thin mat. But the price they paid for dapper hats was
mercury poisoning, which drastically harmed hatters’ central nervous systems. Mercurial disease, or Mad Hatter Disease,
causes extreme emotional states plus physical effects, like tremors and difficulty walking,
speaking, and writing. Since these hats didn’t poison the general
public, the occupational hazards of being a hatter persisted. It took half a century or longer for countries
to start banning the use of mercury in the felt hat industry. But what about cosmetics? One fashion trend that emerged in the 1500s
was an obsession with blindingly white skin. In 16th and 17th-century England, women painted
their faces with a whitening paste called Venetian ceruse. The pigment was made by mixing metallic lead
with acetic acid -- also known as vinegar -- in the presence of carbon dioxide to make
lead carbonate, a powdery white lead. This gave the illusion of a snow-white face,
but over time, it would eat away at people’s skin and caused scarring, headaches, nausea,
muscle damage, baldness, and eventually early death. In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie famously discovered
radium, in the form of radium chloride, by extracting it from the radioactive mineral
called uraninite, or pitchblende. After a couple decades of work, in 1910, they
were able to isolate radium as a pure metal. And this discovery not only thrilled scientific
researchers, but it also caused a wave of “science-based” consumer goods to sweep
the world. We are talking... radium makeup! For example, the London-based Radior in 1917
used radium in products like face creams, soaps, powders, and blush. In the 1930s, ladies in Paris could wear Tho-Radia
brand cosmetics, made from both thorium chloride and radium bromide -- apparently, the more
radioactive elements, the better. Thankfully, most of these products contained
such low amounts of radium that they were pretty much harmless -- although it’s possible
that customers suffered health effects later in life. Instead, the most serious poisoning cases
were in the factories where radium products were made. Especially in the “Radium Girls,” a group
of about 4,000 factory workers in the United States who painted watch faces with glowing
paint and were pretty much bathed in radioactive dust every day. By the 1920s, they began to suffer from anemia,
“radium jaw” and bone cancers. Within about 20 years, largely because of
their plight, radium-branded products had all but disappeared from the market. And people weren’t just putting toxins on
their face for the sake of beauty. They also put poison in their eyes to look
more attractive. The poison in question here is atropine, a
compound derived from a poisonous plant called Deadly Nightshade, or Atropa belladonna. “Belladonna” means “beautiful lady”
in Italian, and it stems from a dangerous beauty practice. In some ancient cultures, women were said
to put drops of juice from Deadly Nightshade berries in their eyes to dilate, or enlarge,
their pupils for that striking doe-eyed look. Atropine is a smooth muscle relaxant, and
your irises are full of smooth muscles that expand and contract to let in different amounts
of light. By adding atropine to your eye, you’re stopping
your iris from being able to respond to light. Putting lots of atropine in your eyes is a
pretty horrible idea, because constantly dilated eyes can expose your retinas to too much light,
damaging the sensory tissues and affecting your vision. Plus, forcing your eye muscles into unnatural
positions has been found to affect your internal eye pressure and damage your optic nerve,
which could lead to blindness. Today, doctors still use atropine for its
muscle relaxing and anesthetic effects, mainly to dilate your pupils before eye exams. They just use it in very small, controlled
doses. Finally, let’s go out with a bang with combustible
fashion accessories! Celluloid was the most successful early, synthetic
plastic. It was cheap, light, strong, easily molded
to whatever shape you wanted. So in the late 1800s and early 1900s, celluloid
accessories were everywhere -- buttons, jewelry, eyeglass frames, toys, and little hair combs
that ladies would wear. But, what people didn’t realize was that
celluloid was manufactured using a compound called cellulose nitrate. Now, cellulose is that naturally-occurring
plant polymer I mentioned earlier. And when you expose cellulose, like in wood
pulp or cotton, to nitric acid, it forms cellulose nitrate -- which is highly flammable. So flammable that it’s also called guncotton
because of its tendency to … explode. So with the rise in popularity of celluloid
accessories came a wave of newspaper articles about combs combusting in people’s hair,
setting their whole body on fire, just from the heat from a curling iron or a nearby electric
lamp. There were even reports of entire stores burning
down because they stored their celluloid stuff too close to windows and mirrors on hot summer
days. So, in comparison, those skinny jeans and
mustache waxes don’t seem so bad now, do they? All told, it’s much safer to commit a fashion
faux-pas than have your skin burned or your hair catch on fire, all because of a trend. Thanks for watching this SciShow List Show,

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: In the 1700s, what were the names of the two special pigments developed that contained arsenic and were used to create a vibrant green color? Options: A. Scheele's Blue and Emerald Green, B. Scheele's Green and Emerald Green, C. Paris Green and Emerald Blue, D. Copper Arsenate and Aniline Green Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the properties of Copper Arsenate.

A more similar question is not present in the list, but if I had to choose one that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

**Question 1** (although it's not a direct match)

But since question 1 is not a direct match, I will try to find another question that might be similar.

Another question that might be similar is:

**Question 9: What was the main reason for the combustibility of celluloid accessories, such as buttons and jewelry, which were popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s? Options: A. They were made from cellulose nitrate, a highly flammable compound, B. They were made from copper arsenate, C. They were made from mercury nitrate, D. They were made from lead carbonate Correct Option: A**

In this question, option B mentions copper arsenate, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

However, this question is still not a direct match.

If I really had to choose one question that is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

**None of the questions are a direct match, but if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 1 or Question 9 (with a focus on option B).**

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more similar question should be generated to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to provide the index of the most similar question, I would say:

**1 or 9 (with a focus on option B)**

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is related to the topic of hazardous materials and their effects on human health.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly address the statement about asbestos fibers, I will select the question that is most closely related to the topic of asbestos and its effects on human health.

Unfortunately, there isn't a question that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing the health effects of a specific substance.

But, I must note that there is a question that directly addresses the topic of asbestos in the transcript. If I were to create a new question based on that information, it would be:

Question: What is a potential health risk associated with asbestos fibers, even when they are woven into clothing?
Options: A. They can break off into tiny pieces that can enter the lungs, B. They can cause skin irritation, C. They can lead to mercury poisoning, D. They have no adverse effects on human health

Correct Option: A

Since this question is not among the generated MCQs, I will not assign an index to it.

However, if I had to choose from the existing questions, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

Index: Not Available (or 4, if I had to choose one, but it's not a good match)

**Transcript**:
Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the capability of dung beetles to bury a certain amount of their own body weight in dung. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 4 is related to the behavior of dung beetles in processing dung.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, but only because it mentions the role of dung beetles in breaking up and tunneling dung into the soil, which is related to their capability to bury dung.

But since none of the generated MCQs are a good match, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the life stages of dung beetles.

Generated MCQ 6 mentions the ecological importance of dung beetles, which includes their role in dispersing seeds and supporting agricultural systems. However, it does not directly address the life stages of dung beetles.

Generated MCQs 1-10 do not explicitly cover the life stages of dung beetles (egg, larva, pupa, adult). Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the life stages or the life cycle of dung beetles, I would choose:

Generated MCQ 4: This question discusses the main difference between the three main groups of dung beetles (rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers) and how they secure and process dung. While it does not directly address the life stages, it does touch on the life cycle and behavior of dung beetles.

Keep in mind that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that explicitly addresses the life stages of dung beetles.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (weak match)

**Transcript**:
Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the ecological role of dung beetles, which is related to their species and diversity.

However, if I had to choose a question that could potentially provide the same information as the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ. This question mentions the ecological importance of dung beetles, which could be related to their diversity and species.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the number of species of dung beetles, I must conclude that there is no direct match.

If I had to choose, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, but with a very low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
- Hello there, my name's Gavin, and welcome to this
episode of The Slow Mo Guys very oddly presented from my living room. A while ago, I made a video called "How a Camera Works In Slow Mo", and the response was great. So I thought a good natural
progression to that video would be how a TV works in slow mo. This is an 85-inch LCD TV, and whenever I'm playing something on it or watching something on it, my eyes and brain are
being misled and tricked, giving me the illusion of
watching a moving object when in fact I'm just
watching several still images just shown to me very, very fast. If I'm watching a film, I'm being shown 24 images
every second, and to my eyes, that looks like I'm
looking at a moving object when in fact I'm looking
at 24 individual pictures. If I'm playing a game, it's the same, except maybe 30 to 60 frames a second, and if I'm on a PC, it could be 100s, PC master race. But a TV like this is actually incapable of showing you one image and
then 1/24 of a second later just switching all at
once to the next image, and to illustrate this next point, I'm gonna use a very old
and very crap CRT TV. That stands for cathode ray tube. If you've ever seen one of these filmed, you may notice that it looks
slightly different on camera than it does to your eye. Look at that. The reason it looks like this is because the shutter speed
of this camera is out of sync with the refresh rate of this screen. The frame is constructed
from the top to the bottom multiple times per second; that's 60 times in the US, 60 Hertz. I've prepared for you
some high speed footage that I shot a long time ago on the v2511 of this screen and this
screen and some others. A lot of it is Dan paying "Super Mario" on the NES extremely badly. Here's the TV and the
cat played back at 25; this is how it would be
perceived in real time. And now at 1600 frames a second, you can actually see the scan line moving from the top to the bottom, and you'll notice that on a CRT screen, it's only the active line
of pixels that's bright, and your persistence of vision will actually build that
into a complete image. It's messing with my eyes, this. - It's like a dance floor. Oh, I didn't even make
it past the first guy. - Slowed all the way down
to 2500 frames a second, you can now differentiate
each individual frame being built from top to bottom. It takes an extremely fast camera to see that each frame
is built line by line from top to bottom, but it
takes an even faster camera to see that each line is
drawn from left to right. Slowed down to 28,500 frames a second, we're now seeing glimpses of that, but we do need to go even slower. This is now 118,000 frames a second, and I'm gonna put the
stats up for you here so you can see the actual
amount of time that it took, and you can see now that
the line is being drawn from left to right on the screen. Now at 146,000 frames a second, to gain perspective on just
how slow this actually is, you can see the exact time I shot this. So this is hours, it
was just past midnight, 23 minutes, 41 seconds,
this is 1/10 of a second, 1/100 of a second, 1/1000 of
a second or a millisecond, and then over here you've
got 1/10,000 of a second, 1/100,000 of a second, and this unit here is the millionth of a
second, or a microsecond. We are now at 380,000 frames a second as our recording frame rate. That is the highest frame
rate we've ever shot so far on this channel,
and using this information, here's a little bonus fact: a CRT screen can draw Mario's mustache in less than 1/380,000 of a second. That is some seriously fast facial hair. And if you're wondering why this footage looks extremely mucky and blurry, it's because the resolution
is only 256 by 128, which, plonked into a
4K frame, is this big. That CRT screen is standard def; this is a 4K screen, which
means it's 3840 by 2160 pixels. That's over eight million pixels. So think of the processing
power that this TV has to have to update an image that big
that many times every second. The first thing you'll notice
about a modern LCD screen is that it's not only
the active line of pixels that retains brightness;
it's the entire image. So you can actually see the full image as each scan-line passes down the screen. This is every frame of the
start-up sequence on an Xbox One. I also recorded myself
playing a game of "Halo". Nothing will make you feel
worse about your performance than watching your lousy aim
in slow mo, look at that. It's crazy to think that
when you're playing "Halo", this is actually what
is happening on your TV. If only you could see at this speed, your aim would be incredible. It honestly makes me feel bad when I fall asleep watching TV, knowing that this TV is
doing all this intensive work changing literally 10s of
millions of pixels every second, and there's no one there watching it. Here's a fun fact: the
same applies to an iPhone, except it's in portrait mode. So if you're watching a video in landscape mode on your iPhone, you're actually getting
updates from left to right, or right to left, depending on
which way you've flipped it, and that just proved to me that you can't see the refresh direction with your naked eye,
because I had no idea, whenever I was watching a
YouTube video on my iPhone, that the screen was updating in a completely different direction. I'm not sure if this is the
case for all smartphones, but it's certainly the
case on an iPhone 7 Plus, which is what I filmed this on. So we've talked about one illusion of TVs, the illusion of movement. The second illusion I wanna talk about is the illusion of color. For this next part, I'm
gonna need a second camera. Here's one, that's you, hello, you. So in order to film this
screen extremely close, I'm gonna have to set my focus to the minimum possible distance, so it's sort of like right here now. Set to my minimum focus, as I slowly move towards the screen, it becomes sharper, and you will then, at the last minute, see a very odd looking pattern. And what you're seeing there is an effect caused by the camera, this camera, trying to resolve individual pixels on the surface of this screen. As I push further forward,
the effect disappears, and everything goes out of focus. That's because I'm now beyond
the minimum focal distance of this lens, which is about,
well, that's about there. Not close enough. In order to get closer, I'm
gonna need a macro lens. Here's one. As I approach the white, and everything starts to become in focus, you can see that white
isn't so white anymore. It looks like I have to
go closer even than that. Thankfully, I can go all the way to five times magnification. Now, one thing from this point, I am definitely gonna need a tripod, because there's no way my arms are sturdy enough to hold this in place, but I'll just ease it in just to show you the level of magnification
we're talking about now. Well, this close, it's a
different story altogether. I'm gonna get a tripod. Here's one. What a mission this is, all right, let's see what we can do here. We're so close up right now that I can actually disturb this image by blowing on the lens. We're now looking at the sub-pixel level. A pixel is made up of three sub-pixels, red, green, and blue, RGB, you
may have heard that before, and this creates the
illusion of different colors. By dimming and brightening
different sub-pixels to different intensities,
this screen can create the illusion of literally
millions of different colors. When all three are lit to full
brightness, you get white. When all three dim, you go through gray all the way down to black. So if green dims away, and
red and blue are still lit, then you go into magenta,
purple, that sort of area, and that's how the colors are made. So every time on your TV you're
looking at a white image, you're looking at tons of
blue, green, and red lights. They're just so small they
look like white to your eye. Before you get white;
red, green, and blue blurs into yellow, cyan, and magenta, and that's what happens here when I move the screen
slightly out of focus. This is too close to watch
a Slow Mo Guys video. I might vomit. It's the same situation, just entire blocks and they're bigger. As I mentioned before,
this is a 4K LCD screen, which, a while back, were typically lit by CCFLs, or a cold
cathode fluorescent lamp, which means the entire panel is backlit by fluorescent tubes. Nowadays, they are backlit by LEDs. This is why this would actually
be marketed as an LED TV. The benefit of LED
screens over CCFL screens is that they're a lot thinner. Now I'm gonna point it at
where some black text is. Now, interestingly, even
though this area is black because all the sub-pixels have dimmed, they are still in fact backlit. Let me show you that right now. Now you can see, as we push in here, you have to pardon the noise, we're at an extremely high ISO to get this shot through a macro lens, but you can see even the dimmed pixels, part of the liquid crystal display as it's now trying to block all light from penetrating through, but
it's still a backlit pixel, and that's one of the
fundamental limitations of an LCD screen. You can see this effect on an LCD screen in the credits of a film, 'cause you've got an almost
completely black image, but because there's white text, the entire backlight has to
be on to display the white, which means light will leak
out from the black pixels, which means it's not true black. There is another technology that's becoming much
more common these days, and that is an OLED screen,
organic light-emitting diode. I did wanna include a comparison between an LCD panel and an OLED panel, but I didn't actually have an OLED TV, and by sheer luck, right in the middle of me shooting all this footage, LG got in touch and offered
to supply me with an OLED TV for the purpose of making this video, which I really appreciate. Thanks, LG. Why don't we go and take a look at it. This is a 77-inch LG OLED TV. The way OLED technology works is that each pixel is self-illuminating, depending on how much voltage
is passing through it, which means there's no
global backlight on the TV. Each pixel is individually in
control of how bright it is, and it's not being lit from behind. And that means, when we go
to our high ISO experiment, just like we did on the LCD, that when there's an area
of black on the screen, all of those pixels are off, and you can see here where
I'm putting my cursor in front of the lens, you can see each sub-pixel lighting up and then completely turning
off when it goes away. This technology means much deeper blacks, and the possibility of a very thin screen. And there you have it: a brief explanation of how a TV works in slow mo. If you found that video interesting, chances are you might find
some other videos interesting on this channel, so make sure you boop, and once you've booped,
feel free to check out our it's just there. Thank you very much for watching. That was good timing, weren't it? TV timed out, and now there's fireworks.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is the main difference between how a CRT screen and an LCD screen display images?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match would be a question that asks about the direction in which lines are drawn on a TV screen.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would choose:

**Question 1: What type of TV is used to illustrate the concept of refresh rate and scan lines in the video?**

However, this question is not about the direction of scan lines.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no exact match. But if you'd like, I can try to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

**Index: Not Available (but if I had to choose, it would be 3)**

Please note that this is not an exact match, and I would recommend creating a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
- Hello there, my name's Gavin, and welcome to this
episode of The Slow Mo Guys very oddly presented from my living room. A while ago, I made a video called "How a Camera Works In Slow Mo", and the response was great. So I thought a good natural
progression to that video would be how a TV works in slow mo. This is an 85-inch LCD TV, and whenever I'm playing something on it or watching something on it, my eyes and brain are
being misled and tricked, giving me the illusion of
watching a moving object when in fact I'm just
watching several still images just shown to me very, very fast. If I'm watching a film, I'm being shown 24 images
every second, and to my eyes, that looks like I'm
looking at a moving object when in fact I'm looking
at 24 individual pictures. If I'm playing a game, it's the same, except maybe 30 to 60 frames a second, and if I'm on a PC, it could be 100s, PC master race. But a TV like this is actually incapable of showing you one image and
then 1/24 of a second later just switching all at
once to the next image, and to illustrate this next point, I'm gonna use a very old
and very crap CRT TV. That stands for cathode ray tube. If you've ever seen one of these filmed, you may notice that it looks
slightly different on camera than it does to your eye. Look at that. The reason it looks like this is because the shutter speed
of this camera is out of sync with the refresh rate of this screen. The frame is constructed
from the top to the bottom multiple times per second; that's 60 times in the US, 60 Hertz. I've prepared for you
some high speed footage that I shot a long time ago on the v2511 of this screen and this
screen and some others. A lot of it is Dan paying "Super Mario" on the NES extremely badly. Here's the TV and the
cat played back at 25; this is how it would be
perceived in real time. And now at 1600 frames a second, you can actually see the scan line moving from the top to the bottom, and you'll notice that on a CRT screen, it's only the active line
of pixels that's bright, and your persistence of vision will actually build that
into a complete image. It's messing with my eyes, this. - It's like a dance floor. Oh, I didn't even make
it past the first guy. - Slowed all the way down
to 2500 frames a second, you can now differentiate
each individual frame being built from top to bottom. It takes an extremely fast camera to see that each frame
is built line by line from top to bottom, but it
takes an even faster camera to see that each line is
drawn from left to right. Slowed down to 28,500 frames a second, we're now seeing glimpses of that, but we do need to go even slower. This is now 118,000 frames a second, and I'm gonna put the
stats up for you here so you can see the actual
amount of time that it took, and you can see now that
the line is being drawn from left to right on the screen. Now at 146,000 frames a second, to gain perspective on just
how slow this actually is, you can see the exact time I shot this. So this is hours, it
was just past midnight, 23 minutes, 41 seconds,
this is 1/10 of a second, 1/100 of a second, 1/1000 of
a second or a millisecond, and then over here you've
got 1/10,000 of a second, 1/100,000 of a second, and this unit here is the millionth of a
second, or a microsecond. We are now at 380,000 frames a second as our recording frame rate. That is the highest frame
rate we've ever shot so far on this channel,
and using this information, here's a little bonus fact: a CRT screen can draw Mario's mustache in less than 1/380,000 of a second. That is some seriously fast facial hair. And if you're wondering why this footage looks extremely mucky and blurry, it's because the resolution
is only 256 by 128, which, plonked into a
4K frame, is this big. That CRT screen is standard def; this is a 4K screen, which
means it's 3840 by 2160 pixels. That's over eight million pixels. So think of the processing
power that this TV has to have to update an image that big
that many times every second. The first thing you'll notice
about a modern LCD screen is that it's not only
the active line of pixels that retains brightness;
it's the entire image. So you can actually see the full image as each scan-line passes down the screen. This is every frame of the
start-up sequence on an Xbox One. I also recorded myself
playing a game of "Halo". Nothing will make you feel
worse about your performance than watching your lousy aim
in slow mo, look at that. It's crazy to think that
when you're playing "Halo", this is actually what
is happening on your TV. If only you could see at this speed, your aim would be incredible. It honestly makes me feel bad when I fall asleep watching TV, knowing that this TV is

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 5: How do LCD screens create the illusion of different colors?**
Options: A. By using a global backlight with different colors, B. By dimming and brightening different sub-pixels to different intensities, C. By using a combination of red, green, and blue LEDs, D. By displaying images at a high frame rate
Correct Option: B

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with the composition of pixels and how they create different colors. Although it doesn't directly ask about the three sub-pixels that make up a pixel, it implies that LCD screens use a combination of sub-pixels to create colors, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 5.

**Transcript**:
Well, we all need a reason to wake up. For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I
were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead. Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet,
and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! (Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death -- and it also began
my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share
of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents for a system that too often
does not serve. Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity
for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled
and concentrated. There are no do-overs. My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking
into this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow. It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens. Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday -- suffering together. Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand, so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed
something we can affect. Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction between necessary
and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three
design cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care, is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something
of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in
the next moment. Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could. It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind
so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective. After my accident,
when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family,
nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body
with flower petals. It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image
to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience
in the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit room
lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop
even when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in,
the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person
had never really existed. Well-intended, of course,
in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for
within those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally
the opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do;
I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma
and treatable illness. They are no place to live and die;
that's not what they were designed for. Now mind you -- I am not
giving up on the notion that our institutions
can become more humane. Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital
in Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really
great care at every turn, including good
palliative care for my pain. And one night, it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses
complaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it
coming down all sticky. Next day, one of my nurses
smuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping
onto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt
and turn into water. In that moment, just being any part of this planet
in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packed
all the inspiration I needed to both try to live
and be OK if I did not. In a hospital, that's a stolen moment. In my work over the years,
I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die. Not because they had found
some final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed
by what their lives had become -- in a word, cut off, or ugly. There are already record numbers of us
living with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age. And we are nowhere near ready
or prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructure
dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. Now is the time to create
something new, something vital. I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar. We have tons of input
for designers of all stripes to work with. We know, for example, from research what's most important to people
who are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened
and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense
of wonderment and spirituality. Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more
from our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette. She finds it harder to breathe
one day to the next due to ALS. Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again -- and French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled
while she has them. Priorities change. Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying
at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy
coursing through her veins -- she's done that. Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,
where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down to
loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the very thing
doing the living and the dying. Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house
is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents
can eat very little, if anything at all. But we realize we are providing
sustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane. Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff
happening under our roof, one of the most tried and true
interventions we know of, is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least
the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people
living and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that say
the things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present -- no need for a past or a future. So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out
of the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity
by way of the senses, by way of the body --
the aesthetic realm -- is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the third
and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights,
to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life
more wonderful, rather than just less horrible. Beneficence. Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient-
or human-centered model of care, and here is where caring
becomes a creative, generative, even playful act. "Play" may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of our
highest forms of adaptation. Consider every major compulsory effort
it takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine. The need for shelter
has given rise to architecture. The need for cover, fashion. And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. So, since dying
is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By "play" I am in no way suggesting
we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate
any particular way of dying. There are mountains of sorrow
that cannot move, and one way or another,
we will all kneel there. Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life
to play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just
getting out of the way, aging and dying can become
a process of crescendo through to the end. We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this. (Laughter) Meanwhile, we can -- (Laughter) We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say
one way or another. I got to redesign my life
around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find
a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting
for a perfect moment, all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it. Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Well, we all need a reason to wake up. For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I
were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead. Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet,
and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! (Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death -- and it also began
my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share
of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents for a system that too often
does not serve. Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity
for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled
and concentrated. There are no do-overs. My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking
into this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow. It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens. Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday -- suffering together. Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand, so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed
something we can affect. Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction between necessary
and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three
design cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care, is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something
of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in
the next moment. Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could. It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind
so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective. After my accident,
when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 9: What does the speaker mean by "designing towards death"?**
Options: A. Creating a plan to prevent or delay death, B. Building a system that acknowledges and accepts death as a natural part of life, C. Developing technology to prolong life and improve healthcare outcomes, D. Focusing on curative treatments and medical interventions

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the idea of rethinking and redesigning the way we approach death. The correct option, "Building a system that acknowledges and accepts death as a natural part of life," aligns with the speaker's message about the need to redesign the healthcare system to prioritize patient-centered care and well-being.

However, an even more similar question is:

**Question 2: According to the speaker, what is the primary issue with the current healthcare system?**
Options: A. It prioritizes patient comfort over curing diseases, B. It is too focused on preventative care, C. It was designed with diseases, not people, at its center, D. It lacks sufficient funding and resources

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the idea of rethinking and redesigning the healthcare system. The correct option, "It was designed with diseases, not people, at its center," aligns with the speaker's message about the need to redesign the healthcare system to prioritize patient-centered care and well-being.

But the most similar question is:

**Question 8: How does the speaker suggest we can make life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible?**
Options: A. By focusing on disease prevention and cure, B. By prioritizing patient-centered care and well-being, C. By increasing funding for healthcare and medical research, D. By promoting healthy lifestyles and behaviors

This question is not the most similar, but the next question is not similar at all.

The next question is similar:

**Question 14: How does the speaker suggest we can create a more humane and compassionate healthcare system?**
Options: A. By prioritizing technology and innovation, B. By focusing on patient-centered care and well-being, C. By increasing funding for healthcare and medical research, D. By promoting healthy lifestyles and behaviors

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the idea of rethinking and redesigning the healthcare system. The correct option, "By focusing on patient-centered care and well-being," aligns with the speaker's message about the need to redesign the healthcare system to prioritize patient-centered care and well-being.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 9 and Question 2 and Question 8 are not the most similar, but Question 14 is not the most similar either**

After re-reading all questions I think I have found the most similar:

**Question 9 is not the most similar, Question 2 is not the most similar, Question 8 is not the most similar, and Question 14 is not the most similar**

The correct answer is the question that says "Rethink" and "Redesign" which are the words in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, there is no question with the words "Rethink" and "Redesign" in the options.

However, I will choose the most similar:

The most similar generated MCQ is **Question 2**

**Transcript**:
After a massive storm tears 
through the Hex Archipelago, you find five grizzled 
survivors in the water. Shivering their timbers, they explain that they’re the former crew 
of the great pirate Greenbeard, who marooned them 
after they tried to mutiny. Each was bound up in a different 
spot on a small island, until the storm washed them out to sea. In gratitude for saving them, 
they reveal a secret: the island they were on is also where 
Greenbeard has buried his treasure hoard. But when the sailors try to describe 
the island, something seems off. All agree it was flat and barren with no 
prominent features except for some trees. Yet each pirate claims they saw 
a different number of trees, ranging from two to six. The pirate who saw two trees says the
treasure was buried right at his feet. When you fly your hot air balloon 
over the area to investigate, you see hundreds of small islands,
each with exactly six trees. The next storm will be here soon, so you’ll have to hurry 
and narrow your search. What does the island with Greenbeard’s
treasure look like from the sky? And where will the treasure be 
on that island? Pause here if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It might seem like the pirates 
are delirious from dehydration. But that’s not what’s going on. Remember, each was confined 
to a separate point on the island, and no two of them could see 
the same number of trees. That means that for all but one pirate, 
something was blocking their view. And since there are no other 
features on the island, that something could only 
have been other trees. A pirate would see fewer trees 
when two or more fell along a straight line 
from their vantage point. So we need to find the island where five different pirates standing 
in different spots would each see a
different number of trees. Virtually every island has a position 
from which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a
position where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations
to find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees
to line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees 
were lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end 
of the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from 
which you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel
and they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position 
where the two lines converge from which you could 
see exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which 
you could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only 
one island in the archipelago with two non-parallel lines of trees, and it’ll be buried at the intersection 
of the two lines. You land on this island and dig up a chest
containing a massive pile of tree seeds, ready for planting. Was this treasure really worth 
all that trouble? That’s a matter of perspective.

No, the treasure was not worth it because it was just a pile of tree seeds, C. It depends on the perspective of the person finding the treasure, D. There is not enough information to determine the answer Correct Option: C


Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of survivors found in the water, while the generated MCQs are about the island, the trees, and the treasure.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar, but if you want me to choose one that is the least dissimilar in terms of being related to the beginning of the story, I would say Question 1 is the least dissimilar, but it is still very dissimilar.

But if I really had to choose one that has the same intent as the ground truth MCQ (which is asking about a quantity), I would say Question 1 is the least dissimilar.

So, my answer would be: Question 1 (but keep in mind that it's still very dissimilar).

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5 or Question 6, as they both discuss the arrangement of trees that allows for a specific number of trees to be visible from a certain vantage point.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. This is because Question 6 specifically asks about the arrangement of trees that allows you to see exactly two trees from a specific vantage point, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the location of the treasure (which is buried at the spot where the pirate saw two trees).

But since the generated MCQs do not directly address the location of the treasure, I must admit that this is a bit of a stretch.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 6

different number of trees. Virtually every island has a position 
from which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a
position where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations
to find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees
to line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees 
were lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end 
of the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from 
which you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel
and they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position 
where the two lines converge from which you could 
see exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which 
you could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only 
one island in the archipelago with two non-parallel lines of trees, and it’ll be buried at the intersection 
of the two lines. You land on this island and dig up a chest
containing a massive pile of tree seeds, ready for planting. Was this treasure really worth 
all that trouble? That’s a matter of perspective.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and the information provided in the transcript, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present among the options.

However, if I had to choose one that is vaguely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 4 is the closest. It talks about the type of location that is most challenging to find on the islands and why. Although it does not directly ask about the number of islands with exactly five trees, it does provide some information about the visibility of trees on the islands.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 4, but please note that it is not a direct match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. For example:

Question: How many islands in the archipelago contain exactly five trees?
Options: A. 0, B. 1, C. 2, D. Hundreds

Or, based on the information provided in the transcript:

Question: What is the common number of trees seen on most islands in the archipelago?
Options: A. 1, B. 2, C. 5, D. 6

This would allow for a more direct comparison with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
After a massive storm tears 
through the Hex Archipelago, you find five grizzled 
survivors in the water. Shivering their timbers, they explain that they’re the former crew 
of the great pirate Greenbeard, who marooned them 
after they tried to mutiny. Each was bound up in a different 
spot on a small island, until the storm washed them out to sea. In gratitude for saving them, 
they reveal a secret: the island they were on is also where 
Greenbeard has buried his treasure hoard. But when the sailors try to describe 
the island, something seems off. All agree it was flat and barren with no 
prominent features except for some trees. Yet each pirate claims they saw 
a different number of trees, ranging from two to six. The pirate who saw two trees says the
treasure was buried right at his feet. When you fly your hot air balloon 
over the area to investigate, you see hundreds of small islands,
each with exactly six trees. The next storm will be here soon, so you’ll have to hurry 
and narrow your search. What does the island with Greenbeard’s
treasure look like from the sky? And where will the treasure be 
on that island? Pause here if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It might seem like the pirates 
are delirious from dehydration. But that’s not what’s going on. Remember, each was confined 
to a separate point on the island, and no two of them could see 
the same number of trees. That means that for all but one pirate, 
something was blocking their view. And since there are no other 
features on the island, that something could only 
have been other trees. A pirate would see fewer trees 
when two or more fell along a straight line 
from their vantage point. So we need to find the island where five different pirates standing 
in different spots would each see a
different number of trees. Virtually every island has a position 
from which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a
position where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations
to find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees
to line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees 
were lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end 
of the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from 
which you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel
and they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position 
where the two lines converge from which you could 
see exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which 
you could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only

**Transcript**:
In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?

**Transcript**:
In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?

**Transcript**:
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true? How much of yourself can you remove, before you stop being you? And does the question even make sense? Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there are stars in the milky way. A cell is a living being, a machine make of up to 50,000 different proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose; it just is. But it is still an individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the enviroment, and so on. If you extract cells from your body, and put them in the right enviroment, they will continue to stay alive for a while. So, your cells can exist without you, but you can't exist without them. If we take all the cells away, there is no 'you' anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person? Or is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine an experiment: you and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time, your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells. At which point would they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you? Let's make this more complicated! The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable. Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven year period most of your cells are replaced at least once. Everytime you cells set up changes, you are slightly different than before. So, a part of you is dying contantly. If you are lucky enough to become old, you would have cycled through roughly a million billion cells. So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes, cells are broken and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer is not an outside invader; it's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours. But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes an other entity inside us - another being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell story, is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually, cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still alive, and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So, there are living parts around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you, anyway? Maybe the information contained in it: your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than one thousand mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria, that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things, made from more little things, that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So, we might just be a self-sustaining pattern, without clear borders, that gained self awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question about ourselves, but it is also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us - while still in the skull... Click here to go to my channel, and watch the next part.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of a cell, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to cells, the human body, and identity.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5. However, this question is not about the definition of a cell but rather about cells that become immortal and prioritize their own survival over the body's.

A more suitable question would be one that asks about the composition or definition of a cell. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

However, if I had to choose, I would say that Question 8 is the closest in terms of discussing the cellular structure, although it's not about the definition of a cell but rather about the genetic code of a single neuron in an adult brain.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that the closest generated MCQ is not among the provided options, as none of them match the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

But, if I really had to choose from the given options, I would say:

**Transcript**:
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true? How much of yourself can you remove, before you stop being you? And does the question even make sense? Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there are stars in the milky way. A cell is a living being, a machine make of up to 50,000 different proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose; it just is. But it is still an individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the enviroment, and so on. If you extract cells from your body, and put them in the right enviroment, they will continue to stay alive for a while. So, your cells can exist without you, but you can't exist without them. If we take all the cells away, there is no 'you' anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person? Or is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine an experiment: you and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time, your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells. At which point would they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you? Let's make this more complicated! The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable. Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven year period most of your cells are replaced at least once. Everytime you cells set up changes, you are slightly different than before. So, a part of you is dying contantly.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question is about the rate at which human cells die and are replaced, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about the time period in which most cells are replaced at least once. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the concept of cell replacement and the dynamic nature of the human body.

However, a more relevant question that could match the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly asks about the time period of cell replacement. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Here's a strange thing wolves and coyotes
have these big upright ears. All the better to hear you with. But my dog Zeke here has floppy ears. Why the difference? Doesn't he need to hear too? Charles Darwin himself actually thought a
lot about this question. 150 years ago, he published a book that said,
"Look—it's not just pet dogs!” Pigs have floppier ears than wild boars. Farmed goats have floppier ears than wild
goats. There are floppy-eared rabbits, cows and sheep. And that's not the only weird thing! Tame animals tend to have shorter snouts,
and their fur tends to be paler or have patches with color missing. All these mysterious traits put together have
been called "domestication syndrome." So, what's going on here? The story starts thousands and thousands of years ago when humans were surrounded by animals. Some animals were scary, and some were a bit more approachable even potentially useful. Our ancestors wanted them to be tamer, so sometimes they tried breeding the friendliest ones. At some point, strange side effects started to show up Thousands of years later, good old Darwin
noticed the domestication syndrome pattern, but all he'd learned about change in the animal kingdom couldn't explain this connection between
behavior and appearance. Scientists who came after him
couldn't figure it out either. But for the past few years, scientists have
been throwing around a fascinating hypothesis. They think the answer to this whole puzzle
lies in a special group of cells. They're called neural crest cells, and coincidentally, they were discovered by Wilhelm His the exact same year Darwin published his book. Neural crest cells show up very early in the
development of all vertebrate embryos. As the embryo grows into a goat or a pig or a wolf, these special cells travel to every corner of the body and take on all sorts of different jobs. Now, here's the thing: Some of these cells
end up right here above the kidneys. They become cells that secrete adrenaline —that famous fight-or-flight hormone. Wild animals are always fighting or fleeing to survive, and that makes it hard for humans to get close. But what if an animal was born with fewer
of these neural crest cells, or those cells didn't work so well? That animal would have less adrenaline. It would probably be less freaked out by humans— and it would pass that behavior on to its offspring. The idea is that this is what's going on in
domesticated animals. Their neural crest cells have been dialed back. And this would explain all the appearance
stuff, too because neural crest derived cells do a lot more than just make adrenaline. Some of the cells end up forming parts of the face. Some of them become cells that control the
color of skin and hair. And some make their way into the ears—and
help make cartilage. It's likely this is how dogs first got floppy ears. And then centuries of intentional human breeding
helped accentuate or reverse that change. But the neural crest cell hypothesis doesn't
quite explain every bit of domestication syndrome. Like—what's going on with other tame species
that do have upright ears? This be might be the excuse scientists need
to spend more time with their pets. This is Skunk Bear—NPR's science show Please subscribe and check out some papers about the neural crest cell hypothesis down in the description.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 has some similarities. However, it does not have the same intent as the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about other animals showing physical signs of domestication syndrome. Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest in terms of content, but it still does not match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 9 is the closest, but it is still not a good match.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about specific animals that show physical signs of domestication syndrome, whereas the generated MCQs do not have a direct equivalent.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 9 is the closest, but with the caveat that it is not a good match.

**Transcript**:
Here's a strange thing wolves and coyotes
have these big upright ears. All the better to hear you with. But my dog Zeke here has floppy ears. Why the difference? Doesn't he need to hear too? Charles Darwin himself actually thought a
lot about this question. 150 years ago, he published a book that said,
"Look—it's not just pet dogs!” Pigs have floppier ears than wild boars. Farmed goats have floppier ears than wild
goats. There are floppy-eared rabbits, cows and sheep. And that's not the only weird thing! Tame animals tend to have shorter snouts,
and their fur tends to be paler or have patches with color missing. All these mysterious traits put together have
been called "domestication syndrome." So, what's going on here? The story starts thousands and thousands of years ago when humans were surrounded by animals. Some animals were scary, and some were a bit more approachable even potentially useful. Our ancestors wanted them to be tamer, so sometimes they tried breeding the friendliest ones. At some point, strange side effects started to show up Thousands of years later, good old Darwin
noticed the domestication syndrome pattern, but all he'd learned about change in the animal kingdom couldn't explain this connection between
behavior and appearance. Scientists who came after him
couldn't figure it out either. But for the past few years, scientists have
been throwing around a fascinating hypothesis. They think the answer to this whole puzzle
lies in a special group of cells. They're called neural crest cells, and coincidentally, they were discovered by Wilhelm His the exact same year Darwin published his book. Neural crest cells show up very early in the
development of all vertebrate embryos. As the embryo grows into a goat or a pig or a wolf, these special cells travel to every corner of the body and take on all sorts of different jobs. Now, here's the thing: Some of these cells
end up right here above the kidneys. They become cells that secrete adrenaline —that famous fight-or-flight hormone. Wild animals are always fighting or fleeing to survive, and that makes it hard for humans to get close. But what if an animal was born with fewer
of these neural crest cells, or those cells didn't work so well? That animal would have less adrenaline. It would probably be less freaked out by humans— and it would pass that behavior on to its offspring. The idea is that this is what's going on in
domesticated animals. Their neural crest cells have been dialed back. And this would explain all the appearance
stuff, too because neural crest derived cells do a lot more than just make adrenaline. Some of the cells end up forming parts of the face. Some of them become cells that control the
color of skin and hair. And some make their way into the ears—and
help make cartilage. It's likely this is how dogs first got floppy ears. And then centuries of intentional human breeding
helped accentuate or reverse that change. But the neural crest cell hypothesis doesn't
quite explain every bit of domestication syndrome. Like—what's going on with other tame species
that do have upright ears? This be might be the excuse scientists need
to spend more time with their pets. This is Skunk Bear—NPR's science show Please subscribe and check out some papers about the neural crest cell hypothesis down in the description.

**Transcript**:
In Margaret Atwood's near-future novel,
"The Handmaid's Tale," a Christian fundamentalist regime
called the Republic of Gilead has staged a military coup
and established a theocratic government in the United States. The regime theoretically 
restricts everyone, but in practice a few men have structured
Gilead so they have all the power, especially over women. The Handmaid's Tale is what Atwood calls
speculative fiction, meaning it theorizes 
about possible futures. This is a fundamental characteristic shared by both utopian 
and dystopian texts. The possible futures in Atwood's novels
are usually negative, or dystopian, where the actions of a small group
have destroyed society as we know it. Utopian and dystopian writing
tends to parallel political trends. Utopian writing frequently depicts
an idealized society that the author puts forth as a blueprint
to strive toward. Dystopias, on the other hand, are not necessarily predictions 
of apocalyptic futures, but rather warnings about the ways
in which societies can set themselves on the path to destruction. The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1985,
when many conservative groups attacked the gains made 
by the second-wave feminist movement. This movement had been advocating greater
social and legal equality for women since the early 1960s. The Handmaid's Tale imagines a future
in which the conservative counter-movement gains 
the upper hand and not only demolishes the progress
women had made toward equality, but makes women completely 
subservient to men. Gilead divides women in the regime
into distinct social classes based upon their function
as status symbols for men. Even their clothing is color-coded. Women are no longer allowed to read or move about freely in public, and fertile women are subject
to state-engineered rape in order to give birth to children
for the regime. Although The Handmaid's Tale
is set in the future, one of Atwood's self-imposed
rules in writing it was that she wouldn't use any event or practice that hadn't already 
happened in human history. The book is set 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city that during 
the American colonial period had been ruled by the theocratic Puritans. In many ways, the Republic of Gilead
resembles the strict rules that were present in Puritan society: rigid moral codes, modest clothing, banishment of dissenters, and regulation of every aspect 
of people's lives and relationships. For Atwood, the parallels 
to Massachusett's Puritans were personal as well as theoretical. She spent several years studying
the Puritans at Harvard and she's possibly descended from
Mary Webster, a Puritan woman accused
of witchcraft who survived her hanging. Atwood is a master storyteller. The details of Gilead, 
which we've only skimmed the surface of, slowly come into focus through the eyes
of its characters, mainly the novel's protagonist Offred, a handmaid in the household 
of a commander. Before the coup that established Gilead, Offred had a husband, a child, a job,
and a normal, middle-class American life. But when the fundamentalist regime
comes into power, Offred is denied her identity, separated from her family, and reduced to being, in Offred's words, "a two-legged womb for increasing 
Gilead's waning population." She initially accepts the loss 
of her fundamental human rights in the name of stabilizing 
the new government. But state control soon extends
into attempts to control the language, behavior, and thoughts of herself
and other individuals. Early on, Offred says, "I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must compose, 
as one composes a speech." She likens language 
to the formulation of identity. Her words also acknowledge 
the possibility of resistance, and it's resistance, the actions of people
who dare to break the political, intellectual, and sexual rules, that drives the plot 
of the Handmaid's Tale. Ultimately, the novel's exploration
of the consequences of complacency, and how power can be wielded unfairly, makes Atwood's chilling vision
of a dystopian regime ever relevant.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: In the Republic of Gilead, how are women divided into distinct social classes? Options: A. Based on their economic status, B. Based on their function as status symbols for men, C. Based on their education level, D. Based on their occupation Correct Option: B**

Although this question does not directly ask about Offred's place in the Commander's household, it is related to the social hierarchy of women in Gilead, which is the context for Offred's role as a Handmaid. The correct option, "Based on their function as status symbols for men," implies that women like Offred are valued for their fertility, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more direct match is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 4**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more targeted question about Offred's role in the Commander's household would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
In Margaret Atwood's near-future novel,
"The Handmaid's Tale," a Christian fundamentalist regime
called the Republic of Gilead has staged a military coup
and established a theocratic government in the United States. The regime theoretically 
restricts everyone, but in practice a few men have structured
Gilead so they have all the power, especially over women. The Handmaid's Tale is what Atwood calls
speculative fiction, meaning it theorizes 
about possible futures. This is a fundamental characteristic shared by both utopian 
and dystopian texts. The possible futures in Atwood's novels
are usually negative, or dystopian, where the actions of a small group
have destroyed society as we know it. Utopian and dystopian writing
tends to parallel political trends. Utopian writing frequently depicts
an idealized society that the author puts forth as a blueprint
to strive toward. Dystopias, on the other hand, are not necessarily predictions 
of apocalyptic futures, but rather warnings about the ways
in which societies can set themselves on the path to destruction. The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1985,
when many conservative groups attacked the gains made 
by the second-wave feminist movement. This movement had been advocating greater
social and legal equality for women since the early 1960s. The Handmaid's Tale imagines a future
in which the conservative counter-movement gains 
the upper hand and not only demolishes the progress
women had made toward equality, but makes women completely 
subservient to men. Gilead divides women in the regime
into distinct social classes based upon their function
as status symbols for men. Even their clothing is color-coded. Women are no longer allowed to read or move about freely in public, and fertile women are subject
to state-engineered rape in order to give birth to children
for the regime. Although The Handmaid's Tale
is set in the future, one of Atwood's self-imposed
rules in writing it was that she wouldn't use any event or practice that hadn't already 
happened in human history. The book is set 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city that during 
the American colonial period had been ruled by the theocratic Puritans. In many ways, the Republic of Gilead
resembles the strict rules that were present in Puritan society: rigid moral codes, modest clothing, banishment of dissenters, and regulation of every aspect 
of people's lives and relationships. For Atwood, the parallels 
to Massachusett's Puritans were personal as well as theoretical. She spent several years studying
the Puritans at Harvard and she's possibly descended from
Mary Webster, a Puritan woman accused
of witchcraft who survived her hanging. Atwood is a master storyteller. The details of Gilead, 
which we've only skimmed the surface of, slowly come into focus through the eyes
of its characters, mainly the novel's protagonist Offred, a handmaid in the household 
of a commander. Before the coup that established Gilead, Offred had a husband, a child, a job,
and a normal, middle-class American life. But when the fundamentalist regime
comes into power, Offred is denied her identity, separated from her family, and reduced to being, in Offred's words, "a two-legged womb for increasing 
Gilead's waning population." She initially accepts the loss 
of her fundamental human rights in the name of stabilizing 
the new government. But state control soon extends
into attempts to control the language, behavior, and thoughts of herself
and other individuals. Early on, Offred says, "I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must compose, 
as one composes a speech." She likens language 
to the formulation of identity. Her words also acknowledge 
the possibility of resistance, and it's resistance, the actions of people
who dare to break the political, intellectual, and sexual rules, that drives the plot 
of the Handmaid's Tale. Ultimately, the novel's exploration
of the consequences of complacency, and how power can be wielded unfairly, makes Atwood's chilling vision
of a dystopian regime ever relevant.

**Transcript**:
Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead through
the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm 34 years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly
to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor; I'm a chef, I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information, education. I profoundly believe
that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful, awful reality right now. America, you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy
countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have
children in this room today? Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up,
aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We, the adults of the last
four generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents. Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food
that we've built around them. Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically
overweight or obese. You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry. (Laughter) The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid
about death, murder, homicide, you name it; it's on the front page
of every paper, CNN. Look at homicide
at the bottom, for God's sake. Right? (Laughter) (Applause) Every single one of those in the red
is a diet-related disease. Any doctor, any specialist
will tell you that. Fact: diet-related disease
is the biggest killer in the United States,
right now, here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you, as usual. (Laughter) I know they were close,
but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems
of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans
10 percent of your health-care bills, 150 billion dollars a year. In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year. Let's be honest, guys,
you haven't got that cash. (Laughter) I came here to start a food revolution
that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping-point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America
for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe --
ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia,
the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year,
but we'll work on that next season. (Laughter) Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people, your public, around the statistics
that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you
to some of the people that I care about: your public, your children. I want to show a picture
of my friend Brittany. She's 16 years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up
within a food environment where they've been taught
to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy, the Edwards family. This is a normal family, guys. Stacy does her best,
but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook
at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here, 12 years old,
he's 350 pounds. He gets bullied, for God's sake. The daughter there, Katie,
she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets
to primary school. Marissa, she's all right,
she's one of your lot. But you know what? Her father, who was obese,
died in her arms, And then the second
most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families,
brothers, sisters. Pastor Steve: an inspirational man, one of my early allies
in Huntington, West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife-edge
of this problem. He has to bury the people, OK? And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends,
his family, his community. Come winter, three times
as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease.
Waste of life. By the way, this is
what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door,
and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK, I see it as a triangle, OK? This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped
the heart out of this country? Let's be frank and honest. Well, modern-day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over
the whole country; we know that. The big brands are
some of the most important powers, powerful powers, in this country. (Sighs) Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed
and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients,
and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously
a massive, massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country
is a disgrace. The industry wants
to self-police themselves. What, in this kind of climate?
They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low-fat
when it's full of so much sugar? Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart
of passing on food culture, what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know, as we go
to work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have
to look at it holistically -- step back for a moment,
and re-address the balance. It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now;
the Edwards family. (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk. This stuff goes through you
and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill
your children early. How are you feeling? Stacy: Just feeling really sad
and depressed right now. But, you know, I want
my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO: Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much
a specialist in. OK, school. What is school? Who invented it?
What's the purpose of school? School was always invented
to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc. You know, it's been kind of in this sort
of tight box for a long, long time, OK? But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health
catastrophes of America, OK? School food is something that most kids --
31 million a day, actually -- have twice a day, more than often,
breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year. So you could say that school
food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances. (Laughter) Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for -- (Laughter) I need to say one thing,
and it's so important in, hopefully, the magic
that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies,
the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being
told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any,
food-knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem: If you're not a food expert,
and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter,
then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive
and write different things around things. If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do
in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get
every day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough
fresh food in there at all. You know, the amount
of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe -- there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast.
They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks?
No, they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No. And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives
and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food,
because it's handheld. And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas,
it's all of that stuff. (Sighs) Ten percent of what we spend
on health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right
to teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK? We don't teach kids about food, right? And this is a little clip
from an elementary school, which is very common in England. (Video) Who knows what this is? Child: Potatoes. Jamie Oliver: Potato?
So, you think these are potatoes? Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is? Child: Broccoli? JO: What about this? Our good old friend. Child: Celery. JO: No. What do you think this is? Child: Onion.
JO: Onion? No. JO: Immediately you
get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything
about where food comes from?" Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear? JO: What do you think this is?
Child: I don't know. JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it. (Laughter) JO: Normal. England and America, England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one-hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids
about food in schools, period. (Applause) I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble
that we're in, guys, OK? I want to talk about something
so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk
at school, breakfast and lunch, right? They'll be having two bottles, OK? And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong, I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money
for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples
they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean? For me, there isn't any need
to flavor the milk. Okay? There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs
of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern-day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar
as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop, and they are having two a day. So, let me just show you. We've got one kid, here -- having, you know,
eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know, there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years
of elementary school sugar, just from milk. Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics
and the evidence, and they would find any government
of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I came up here, and I wish
I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting
and scrambling to get to me. This, all this bad news, is preventable. That's the good news. It's very, very preventable. So, let's just think about,
we got a problem here, we need to reboot. Okay so, in my world,
what do we need to do? Here is the thing, right, it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you
in the white of the eyes and say, "In 10 years' time, the history of your children's lives, happiness -- and let's not forget,
you're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff,
it will look different. OK?" So, supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously? Week in, week out. How much money do you spend,
in your life, in a supermarket? Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador
in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook
quick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some, and it needs
to be done across the board in America soon, and quick. The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education
at the heart of their businesses. I know, easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive. I've had loads
of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean, basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar,
salt and fat, and x, y, and z, and everyone loves them, right? So, these guys are going
to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors
and the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar and all the other
non-food ingredients. Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier,
is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK, school. Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year, from that little precious age of four, until 18, 20, 24, whatever, they need to be cooked proper, fresh food from local growers on site, OK? There needs to be a new
standard of fresh, proper food for your children, yeah? (Applause) Under the circumstances,
it's profoundly important that every single
American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life. Life skills. (Applause) That means that they can be
students, young parents, and be able to sort of duck and dive
around the basics of cooking, no matter what recession hits
them next time. If you can cook,
recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook, time doesn't matter. The workplace, we haven't
really talked about it. You know, it's now time
for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed
or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads
of America's children. Marissa, her father died in her hand, I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start
feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now, look, if we do
all this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on
cooking again, for sure. For sure, pass it on as a philosophy. And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person
teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole
population of America. Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts
makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington, where I made this program, we've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people
to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen.
I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area
from the junk, onto the fresh food: six-and-a-half grand per school. (Applause) That's all it takes,
six-and-a-half grand per school. The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay? This can do 5,000 people a year, which is 10 percent of their population, and it's people on people. You know, it's local cooks
teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons,
guys, in the Main Street. This is real, tangible change,
real, tangible change. Around America, if we just look back now, there is plenty of wonderful
things going on. There is plenty of beautiful
things going on. There are angels
around America doing great things in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups, garden set-ups, education -- there are amazing people
doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts
and the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them
to easily find the resource to keep rolling out
what they're already doing, and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things
that she wants to do. (Applause) And look, I know it's weird having an English person
standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is: I care. I'm a father, and I love this country. And I believe truly, actually, that if change can be made
in this country, beautiful things will happen
around the world. If America does it,
other people will follow. It's incredibly important. (Audience) Yeah! (Applause) When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work
when they weren't, I thought "If I had a magic wand,
what would I do?" And I thought, "You know what? I'd just love to be put in front
of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America." And a month later, TED phoned me up
and gave me this award. I'm here. So, my wish. Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong,
sustainable movement to educate every child about food, to inspire families to cook again, and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause continues)

**Transcript**:
Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead through
the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm 34 years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly
to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor; I'm a chef, I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information, education. I profoundly believe
that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful, awful reality right now. America, you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy
countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have
children in this room today? Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up,
aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We, the adults of the last
four generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents. Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food
that we've built around them. Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically
overweight or obese. You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry. (Laughter) The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid
about death, murder, homicide, you name it; it's on the front page
of every paper, CNN. Look at homicide
at the bottom, for God's sake. Right? (Laughter) (Applause) Every single one of those in the red
is a diet-related disease. Any doctor, any specialist
will tell you that. Fact: diet-related disease
is the biggest killer in the United States,
right now, here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you, as usual. (Laughter) I know they were close,
but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems
of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans
10 percent of your health-care bills, 150 billion dollars a year. In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year. Let's be honest, guys,
you haven't got that cash. (Laughter) I came here to start a food revolution
that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping-point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America
for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe --
ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia,
the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year,
but we'll work on that next season. (Laughter) Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people, your public, around the statistics
that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you
to some of the people that I care about: your public, your children. I want to show a picture
of my friend Brittany. She's 16 years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up
within a food environment where they've been taught
to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy, the Edwards family. This is a normal family, guys. Stacy does her best,
but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook
at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here, 12 years old,
he's 350 pounds. He gets bullied, for God's sake. The daughter there, Katie,
she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets
to primary school. Marissa, she's all right,
she's one of your lot. But you know what? Her father, who was obese,
died in her arms, And then the second
most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families,
brothers, sisters. Pastor Steve: an inspirational man, one of my early allies
in Huntington, West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife-edge
of this problem. He has to bury the people, OK? And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends,
his family, his community. Come winter, three times
as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease.
Waste of life. By the way, this is
what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door,
and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK, I see it as a triangle, OK? This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped
the heart out of this country? Let's be frank and honest. Well, modern-day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over
the whole country; we know that. The big brands are
some of the most important powers, powerful powers, in this country. (Sighs) Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed
and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients,
and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously
a massive, massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country
is a disgrace. The industry wants
to self-police themselves. What, in this kind of climate?
They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low-fat
when it's full of so much sugar? Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart
of passing on food culture, what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know, as we go
to work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have
to look at it holistically -- step back for a moment,
and re-address the balance. It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now;
the Edwards family. (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk. This stuff goes through you
and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill
your children early. How are you feeling? Stacy: Just feeling really sad
and depressed right now. But, you know, I want
my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO: Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much
a specialist in. OK, school. What is school? Who invented it?
What's the purpose of school? School was always invented
to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc. You know, it's been kind of in this sort
of tight box for a long, long time, OK? But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health
catastrophes of America, OK? School food is something that most kids --
31 million a day, actually -- have twice a day, more than often,
breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year. So you could say that school
food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances. (Laughter) Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for -- (Laughter) I need to say one thing,
and it's so important in, hopefully, the magic
that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies,
the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being
told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any,
food-knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem: If you're not a food expert,
and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter,
then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive
and write different things around things. If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do
in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get
every day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough
fresh food in there at all. You know, the amount
of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe -- there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast.
They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks?
No, they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No. And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives
and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food,
because it's handheld. And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas,
it's all of that stuff. (Sighs) Ten percent of what we spend
on health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right
to teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK? We don't teach kids about food, right? And this is a little clip
from an elementary school, which is very common in England. (Video) Who knows what this is? Child: Potatoes. Jamie Oliver: Potato?
So, you think these are potatoes? Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is? Child: Broccoli? JO: What about this? Our good old friend. Child: Celery. JO: No. What do you think this is? Child: Onion.
JO: Onion? No. JO: Immediately you
get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything
about where food comes from?" Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear? JO: What do you think this is?
Child: I don't know. JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it. (Laughter) JO: Normal. England and America, England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one-hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids
about food in schools, period. (Applause) I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble
that we're in, guys, OK? I want to talk about something
so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk
at school, breakfast and lunch, right? They'll be having two bottles, OK? And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong, I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money
for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples
they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean? For me, there isn't any need

and the evidence, and they would find any government

I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting
and scrambling to get to me. This, all this bad news, is preventable. That's the good news. It's very, very preventable. So, let's just think about,
we got a problem here, we need to reboot. Okay so, in my world,

**Transcript**:
In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the correct sequence of life stages in a butterfly's life cycle. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the sequence of life stages, Question 4 touches on the developmental process of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, which is related to the life cycle.

However, a closer match can be found in the context of the transcript and the generated MCQs. Question 8 discusses the significance of complete metamorphosis in the life cycle of insects, which is not directly related to the sequence of life stages but is relevant to the topic.

Unfortunately, there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs for the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on the topic and relevance, I would suggest Question 8 as a distant match.

inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve

**Transcript**:
In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place

Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So today we're in the rocket van and I've got two little science helpers here right? Kids: Yes, right. Are you wearing your seatbelts? Yes. OK we're gonna do something pretty interesting. Check this out. I've got a pendulum suspended from the top of our family van and we're just gonna drive forward, we're gonna accelerate, so if we're going that way, which direction do you think this pendulum should go? What do you think? 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Kids: Yes. Which way is it going? Kids: My way. That's right. It's because I'm accelerating right? Does that make sense to you guys? Yes sir. OK very good, I was hoping it would make sense. So we're gonna change it up just a little bit. OK so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna replace this pendulum with a balloon. We should see the same thing right? Let me cut this off. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna accelerate that way so we have the mass of the balloon and the acceleration that should net in a force and will have to react with this string right? You guys ready? Yes sir. 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Wait a second. What just happened? What happens when I stop? The balloon goes backwards when I stop. What's happening? 3.. 2.. 1..Go. There it is. It's coming right at me. Why's it doing that? Do you wanna know? Yeah. Alright, I brought something to show you. You remember I told you I was gonna bring this jar earlier? Remember that? So it's like this. Imagine this entire van is just like this jar, and all the air inside this van is just like the water in the jar. Does that make sense? So let's imagine that the balloon is this bubble on top, because the helium in the balloon is lighter than air right? So that causes it to do what? Kids: Go up. Go up, that's right. So if I've got this air that's just like it, what happens if I move the jar that way? All that water sloshes to the back. And when that water sloshes back this way, which direction does the bubble go? You see that? So the air bubble moves in the direction of acceleration, does that make sense? I know you're five but I think you can get this. OK so I've got my seatbelt on. If I drive forward real fast right now which direction is the balloon gonna go? Forward. Why will it go forward? Because all the air's sloshing back. That's right! Very good! Watch this. Look at that. You see that? So you know what that means don't you? That means you have more air to breathe than daddy does when I'm going fast. Did you realise that? Kids: Nooo! Yeah that means when I go fast, that means more air sloshes back there to you and you have more oxygen to breathe. Doesn't it feel good back there? OK so now we have the plumb bob right next to the balloon, so if I go forward they should spread apart right? Let's check it out. Is it working? Kids: Yeah. So what I want to do is I want to tell everybody on Smarter Every Day that if they go download a free audio book that it'll help Smarter Every Day by sponsoring us. Audible will, if they go to audible.com/smarter. And so they get a free audio book, but I'm gonna do it in a funny way. Now lean in towards me and look straight at the camera. I know you don't know what I'm gonna do but don't laugh because I want people to realize that they can send you to school if they get a audio book. Does that make sense? Yeah. So whatever happens don't laugh. OK? Look straight at the camera. Ready? You don't know what I'm doing, do you? OK you ready? (High pitched helium voice) Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day and if you would please download an audio book at audible.com/smarter. Did you know daddy could talk like this? No. You didn't know that happened, did you? So if you go get a free audio book it'll support Smarter Every Day and it'll help me send these kids to school. Does that sound like a good idea? Yes. You should never do that, by the way. That's only for adults. How'd you do that? It's magical. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Please subscribe to Smarter Every Day and support our sponsor audible, I'll leave a link somewhere and you can check it out. Thanks, bye. How'd you change your voice? OK now we have the sunroof, the side window and the back open. I'm gonna go forward, where do you think it's gonna go? Daughter: Forward. Son: Backwards. 3.. 2.. 1.. Dad: So this is air, not helium? Yes sir. OK I think it's gonna act like the pendulum. Dad: 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. (laughs) Backwards. Oh it does. We're gonna use that one.

You guys ready? Yes sir. 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Wait a second. What just happened? What happens when I stop? The balloon goes backwards when I stop. What's happening? 3.. 2.. 1..Go. There it is. It's coming right at me. Why's it doing that? Do you wanna know? Yeah. Alright, I brought something to show you. You remember I told you I was gonna bring this jar earlier? Remember that? So it's like this. Imagine this entire van is just like this jar, and all the air inside this van is just like the water in the jar. Does that make sense? So let's imagine that the balloon is this bubble on top, because the helium in the balloon is lighter than air right? So that causes it to do what? Kids: Go up. Go up, that's right. So if I've got this air that's just like it, what happens if I move the jar that way? All that water sloshes to the back. And when that water sloshes back this way, which direction does the bubble go? You see that? So the air bubble moves in the direction of acceleration, does that make sense? I know you're five but I think you can get this. OK so I've got my seatbelt on. If I drive forward real fast right now which direction is the balloon gonna go? Forward. Why will it go forward? Because all the air's sloshing back. That's right! Very good! Watch this. Look at that. You see that? So you know what that means don't you? That means you have more air to breathe than daddy does when I'm going fast. Did you realise that? Kids: Nooo! Yeah that means when I go fast, that means more air sloshes back there to you and you have more oxygen to breathe. Doesn't it feel good back there? OK so now we have the plumb bob right next to the balloon, so if I go forward they should spread apart right? Let's check it out. Is it working? Kids: Yeah. So what I want to do is I want to tell everybody on Smarter Every Day that if they go download a free audio book that it'll help Smarter Every Day by sponsoring us. Audible will, if they go to audible.com/smarter. And so they get a free audio book, but I'm gonna do it in a funny way. Now lean in towards me and look straight at the camera. I know you don't know what I'm gonna do but don't laugh because I want people to realize that they can send you to school if they get a audio book. Does that make sense? Yeah. So whatever happens don't laugh. OK? Look straight at the camera. Ready? You don't know what I'm doing, do you? OK you ready? (High pitched helium voice) Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day and if you would please download an audio book at audible.com/smarter. Did you know daddy could talk like this? No. You didn't know that happened, did you? So if you go get a free audio book it'll support Smarter Every Day and it'll help me send these kids to school. Does that sound like a good idea? Yes. You should never do that, by the way. That's only for adults. How'd you do that? It's magical. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Please subscribe to Smarter Every Day and support our sponsor audible, I'll leave a link somewhere and you can check it out. Thanks, bye. How'd you change your voice? OK now we have the sunroof, the side window and the back open. I'm gonna go forward, where do you think it's gonna go? Daughter: Forward. Son: Backwards. 3.. 2.. 1.. Dad: So this is air, not helium? Yes sir. OK I think it's gonna act like the pendulum. Dad: 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. (laughs) Backwards. Oh it does. We're gonna use that one.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the behavior of a helium-filled balloon when the vehicle accelerates forward. The options provided in Question 3 are also similar to those in the ground truth MCQ, with the correct answer being that the balloon moves forward (or "Go Up" in the context of the ground truth MCQ, which refers to the balloon's behavior due to the helium being lighter than air). 

However, it's worth noting that Question 3 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, as it does not explicitly state that the helium is lighter than air. Nevertheless, it is the closest match among the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Your interstellar police squad
has tracked a group of dangerous rebels to a cluster of of seven small planets. Now you must apprehend them quickly 
before their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put. They’ll try to dodge you
by moving from planet to planet. But you have one major advantage. Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser 
can warp between any two planets, while their beat-up smuggling ship can only jump to an adjacent planet 
in that same time. These rebels don’t like to stay put. Every time they can relocate, they will. Your scouts tell you that the approaching
rebel fleet is 10 hours away. You can’t risk letting the rebels escape. Can you devise a sequence 
for searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them 
in 10 warps or less, no matter what moves they make? Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy. For one, you have no way of knowing which 
planet they’re on to begin with. And without that information, it’s hard 
to determine where they’ll move next. So where do you begin? When tackling problems of this kind 
it often helps to simplify things, so you can better understand 
their dynamics. Let’s imagine that this cluster 
has the same arrangement but no outermost planets,
leaving only the four in the center. We still don’t know which planet 
the rebels start on. But there’s one key feature: the third planet 
is adjacent to all others, which means the rebels either start there 
and move somewhere else, or start on one of the other planets and have no choice 
but to move to planet three. Simply checking planet three
twice in a row would do the trick. Adding the three outer planet 
adds a bit more complexity, but the same strategy remains. We want to check the planets in an order 
that will eventually corner the rebels. And there’s another insight 
that can help us: each hour, the rebels move from 
an even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. This gives us a way 
to simplify the problem by dividing the planets into two subsets, and tackling each one separately. For starters, let’s assume the rebels 
begin on an even-numbered planet: either two, four, or six. So we’ll search planet two first. If they’re not there, they must have 
started on either four or six. which means they can move to three, five, or seven. Planet three at the center gives them 
the most options for their next move, so we’ll want to check there next. If we don’t find them, they must have been
at planet five or seven, meaning they’ll next move to four or six. Let’s now search planet four. If they’re not there, they must have gone 
to the sixth planet and can only flee to three or seven. If we next scour planet three 
and don’t find them, we know they went to planet seven 
and are now cornered. They can only move to planet six, where
we’ll apprehend them on our fifth search. Of course, this plan only works assuming that the rebels were on 
an even-numbered planet in the first hour. But what if that assumption was wrong? In that case, they must’ve started 
on an odd-numbered planet. And because they move to an adjacent 
planet every hour, their location must alternate between
odd and even-numbered planets. This means that if they were on 
an odd-numbered planet to start, after five moves, they'd be 
on an even-numbered planet. So if our first five searches missed them because our assumption that they started 
on an even-numbered planet was wrong, all we have to do now 
is repeat the sequence! Searching the planets in order two, three, four, three, six, two, three, four, three, six, leaves the rebels nowhere to run. Thanks to your deductive reasoning, 
order is restored to the galaxy.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I must note that Question 7 does not ask about the number of planets the rebels can warp to if they are on planet 4. Instead, it asks about the next planet to search if the rebels are not found on planet 2.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the number of adjacent planets to a specific planet. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of content, as it describes the key feature of the third planet being adjacent to all other planets. However, this question does not ask about the number of planets the rebels can warp to.

Considering the options and the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the possible locations of the rebels after five hours if the police squad is on planet 5. The correct answer is that they can be on any planet.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most similar in terms of question intent and content. It asks about how the rebels move between planets every hour, and the correct answer is that they move from an even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. While this question does not directly ask about the possible locations of the rebels after five hours, it provides insight into their movement pattern, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer match is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but it's not a perfect match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the possible locations of the rebels after five hours if they are initially on planet 5. The correct answer is that they must be on planet 1, 3, 5, or 7.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most relevant, but it does not ask about the specific scenario described in the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 5 does describe the movement pattern of the rebels, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, although it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Your interstellar police squad
has tracked a group of dangerous rebels to a cluster of of seven small planets. Now you must apprehend them quickly 
before their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put. They’ll try to dodge you
by moving from planet to planet. But you have one major advantage. Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser 
can warp between any two planets, while their beat-up smuggling ship can only jump to an adjacent planet 
in that same time. These rebels don’t like to stay put. Every time they can relocate, they will. Your scouts tell you that the approaching
rebel fleet is 10 hours away. You can’t risk letting the rebels escape. Can you devise a sequence 
for searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them 
in 10 warps or less, no matter what moves they make? Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy. For one, you have no way of knowing which 
planet they’re on to begin with. And without that information, it’s hard 
to determine where they’ll move next. So where do you begin? When tackling problems of this kind 
it often helps to simplify things, so you can better understand 
their dynamics. Let’s imagine that this cluster 
has the same arrangement but no outermost planets,
leaving only the four in the center. We still don’t know which planet 
the rebels start on. But there’s one key feature: the third planet 
is adjacent to all others, which means the rebels either start there 
and move somewhere else, or start on one of the other planets and have no choice 
but to move to planet three. Simply checking planet three
twice in a row would do the trick. Adding the three outer planet 
adds a bit more complexity, but the same strategy remains. We want to check the planets in an order 
that will eventually corner the rebels. And there’s another insight 
that can help us: each hour, the rebels move from 
an even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. This gives us a way 
to simplify the problem by dividing the planets into two subsets, and tackling each one separately. For starters, let’s assume the rebels 
begin on an even-numbered planet: either two, four, or six. So we’ll search planet two first. If they’re not there, they must have 
started on either four or six. which means they can move to three, five, or seven. Planet three at the center gives them 
the most options for their next move, so we’ll want to check there next. If we don’t find them, they must have been
at planet five or seven, meaning they’ll next move to four or six. Let’s now search planet four. If they’re not there, they must have gone 
to the sixth planet and can only flee to three or seven. If we next scour planet three 
and don’t find them, we know they went to planet seven 
and are now cornered. They can only move to planet six, where
we’ll apprehend them on our fifth search. Of course, this plan only works assuming that the rebels were on 
an even-numbered planet in the first hour. But what if that assumption was wrong? In that case, they must’ve started 
on an odd-numbered planet. And because they move to an adjacent 
planet every hour, their location must alternate between
odd and even-numbered planets. This means that if they were on 
an odd-numbered planet to start, after five moves, they'd be 
on an even-numbered planet. So if our first five searches missed them because our assumption that they started 
on an even-numbered planet was wrong, all we have to do now 
is repeat the sequence! Searching the planets in order two, three, four, three, six, two, three, four, three, six, leaves the rebels nowhere to run. Thanks to your deductive reasoning, 
order is restored to the galaxy.

take a look at this photo something really really cool happening in this photo can you tell what it is is it stage fright she's got sweaty palms maybe butterflies in her belly is it an aha moment whatever it is it's an I have something to say moment who's out there in the audience though will she make them laugh will she make them think what about the millions that might be watching online who will hear her words as a call to action whatever it is that's on our mind mrs. and I have something to say moment you guys have had these before right the sense of urgency it's full of a need a physical need to say that thing right now this moment the moment in which a human shares her or his idea with another person or other people has been happening since we've had words to express ideas I think it's one of the most important moments that happens in our human development in this moment we can shut down or we can speak up we can be shut down or we can be asked to speak up so that others in the room can hear we can be ignored or we can be heard what happens to us in these moments what we do with them how they're received whether or not they're encouraged determines so much about how we engage with the rest of the world about how we decide to act the next time we have one of these moments so the history of the origin of human language is a talk for a different day and incidentally it is something it is a very very deep rabbit hole to get into when you're procrastinating on something else that you should be doing despite lots of competing efforts theories as to how and when we started doing this it does seem like we humans have been communicating as a tool to advance humanity and as a measurement of our progress as a species human connection the ability to communicate to warn each other to ask questions to use our collective voice it's what saves us from danger it's what solves problems it's what makes us human as humans we've developed a lot of tools to kind of help us along the way in terms of of giving potential power to this moment we've created a lot of things the first alphabet the first book the first telegram the first telephone it's a sexy one the first radio the first TV this is where things start to speed up a little bit the first VCR the internet the first social network and the first smart phone that's right each of these inventions helped a human's voice go farther and faster than it ever had before but with the advent of each of these tools we see a pattern at first they're available to who to the wealthy to the powerful right the people who are able to communicate who are able to share their ideas were the philosophers the inventors the military guys in suits eventually though over a long period of time each of these tools makes communication more accessible here's the crazy thing about our modern world though the internet and I say this carefully because I realized that we have a lot of debilitating accessibility issues that we still need to work through but the internet and the things that go along with it social networks and smartphones are making communication more accessible than it ever has been before this is an especially big deal because unlike the VCR or the TV or even radio these new technologies allow you you not just the rich and the powerful but you to connect to the world outside of right here beyond the walls of your bedroom beyond your in unprecedented ways today all you need to get to get a voice out there is one glowing rectangle and some bandwidth this means that you no longer have to be part of some elite class to share your ideas with the world right thanks to smartphones and YouTube you can be this 10 year old kid sitting in his mom's after basketball practice Nyame is one example that says a lot about why we might be smarter as a society to get out of the way and invest more time in young people sharing their thoughts and ideas there are lots of other reasons for this really it just makes good sense you all are the ones that have the biggest the largest amount of time left to solve the big problems that we have not really been able to make too much of a dent in also you're naturally better equipped than we are to solve these problems you all are the first native speakers of this digital language you're the ones who are experts at Twitter and snapchat and whatever that new thing is that's probably come out during the time that I've been speaking that you've already mastered I think Celia over there probably already has 12 viral snap twit chats whatever the new thing is gonna be called already experts at it this is something that is additionally important because you all don't see things that can't be done you see things you haven't done yet you naturally question what we old consider to be the status quo because quite frankly your status hasn't been quote yet like to me this is the box that my Vitamix came in I don't I don't have a Vitamix I don't know why I said that to me this is a box to a seven-year-old it's a lab for doing experiments or a sweet plane to practice your upside down flight loops in or something that can take you all the way to Pluto because when you're seven you don't judge Pluto for having its planetary status downgraded you think sweet Pluto I am totally going there you'll pick the uncomfortable fight that we tiptoe around every day you'll name the elephant in the room because there's a freaking elephant in the room okay so this is these are the reasons that I think that you all are better equipped to handle these problems than we are so y'all got this all right Celia you're in charge no I'm kidding I'm kidding but this is the kind of thing that we actually do right we say that youth voice is important but that's a lot different than really giving it space to flourish it's a lot different than actually listening so I did a lot of prep as any expert would for this talk but what struck me was that I what I probably should do is get out of the way work to create some space for young people to share their ideas and then step aside which is exactly what my program there are over two billion school-aged individuals living in the world today that's more young people than any other time in human history and it's this generations creativity their actions their art their poetry their protests their questions their code their dreams it's this generations ideas that will define the future of our world one well articulated idea can reach and inspire millions that's why Ted's youth and education initiative Ted ed has created a program that's dedicated to sparking and celebrating the best ideas of young people around the world it was to create more confident individuals it was Eric lebas was won by us for the program is called ted-ed clubs it supports students in identifying their passions learning public speaking skills connecting with a global network of classrooms and sharing student ideas in the form of short TED style talks here's how it works participating students and teachers gain access to a free and flexible curriculum they can use to start a TED ed Club at their school each suggested meeting uses TED Talks to help students engage in critical thinking exercises and gain invaluable presentation skills in the final meeting students are invited to give their own TED talk and if they record their talk they can upload it to Ted Ed's award-winning platform where it can be referenced on a resume a college application and shared with participating clubs around the world over two billion young people empowered and encouraged to share their ideas imagine that future and bring TED ed clubs to your community today we are not the only organization that is trying to amplify youth voices FIRST Robotics inspires young people to become leaders in science and technology by having them design and build and program robots that solve real-world engineering challenges the YMCA Youth in government program encourages young people to take over state and national governments by researching debating and voting on policy issues that they care about for their own governments not that there's anything wrong with the way that my country or yours has been handling our governments lately the Stanford design schools project Wayfarer focuses on helping teens discover and navigate a path for their future for your future based on your unique qualities rather than some prepackaged school subjects each of these efforts have same fundamental assumption you have something uniquely valuable to say right now not in some distant future time when all of a sudden you go from becoming the leaders of tomorrow to right now leaders so what kinds of things do we talk about what kinds of things are on your mind well society like feeds off of insecurity and I think everyone should learn to like your peers and they know your bullying stress body image have been viewed on our platform over a million times these students are leaders right now in today's world everywhere you go is a potential stage your kitchen your mom's front seat your classroom and many of you are carrying a device in your pocket that will carry your thoughts your dreams your voice across the world you can connect to other cultures and perspectives you can brainstorm and collaborate in ways that I will never be able to understand because I don't get snapchat filters and I never will most importantly though you're all carrying a story that is uniquely yours it is your something to say just like this young girl has her something to say right on the tip of her tongue this moment frozen in time represents you and the millions of young people just like you and also not at all like you who will have thoughts ideas questions and curiosities and if you're brave enough to say it to share it it can travel farther and do more good now than any other time in history so I'm gonna get off the stage now because it's your turn what do you want to do with it thank you [Applause]

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of school-aged individuals living in the world today. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 6 mentions the main goal of the TED-Ed Clubs program, which is related to empowering young people. However, it does not specifically ask about the number of school-aged individuals.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6. However, please note that it is not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (although it's not a direct match)

To create a direct match, a new generated MCQ could be created, such as:

Question: According to the speaker, how many school-aged individuals are living in the world today?
Options: A. 300 million, B. 200 million, C. 2 billion, D. 5 billion
Correct Option: C

This new generated MCQ would be a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
take a look at this photo something really really cool happening in this photo can you tell what it is is it stage fright she's got sweaty palms maybe butterflies in her belly is it an aha moment whatever it is it's an I have something to say moment who's out there in the audience though will she make them laugh will she make them think what about the millions that might be watching online who will hear her words as a call to action whatever it is that's on our mind mrs. and I have something to say moment you guys have had these before right the sense of urgency it's full of a need a physical need to say that thing right now this moment the moment in which a human shares her or his idea with another person or other people has been happening since we've had words to express ideas I think it's one of the most important moments that happens in our human development in this moment we can shut down or we can speak up we can be shut down or we can be asked to speak up so that others in the room can hear we can be ignored or we can be heard what happens to us in these moments what we do with them how they're received whether or not they're encouraged determines so much about how we engage with the rest of the world about how we decide to act the next time we have one of these moments so the history of the origin of human language is a talk for a different day and incidentally it is something it is a very very deep rabbit hole to get into when you're procrastinating on something else that you should be doing despite lots of competing efforts theories as to how and when we started doing this it does seem like we humans have been communicating as a tool to advance humanity and as a measurement of our progress as a species human connection the ability to communicate to warn each other to ask questions to use our collective voice it's what saves us from danger it's what solves problems it's what makes us human as humans we've developed a lot of tools to kind of help us along the way in terms of of giving potential power to this moment we've created a lot of things the first alphabet the first book the first telegram the first telephone it's a sexy one the first radio the first TV this is where things start to speed up a little bit the first VCR the internet the first social network and the first smart phone that's right each of these inventions helped a human's voice go farther and faster than it ever had before but with the advent of each of these tools we see a pattern at first they're available to who to the wealthy to the powerful right the people who are able to communicate who are able to share their ideas were the philosophers the inventors the military guys in suits eventually though over a long period of time each of these tools makes communication more accessible here's the crazy thing about our modern world though the internet and I say this carefully because I realized that we have a lot of debilitating accessibility issues that we still need to work through but the internet and the things that go along with it social networks and smartphones are making communication more accessible than it ever has been before this is an especially big deal because unlike the VCR or the TV or even radio these new technologies allow you you not just the rich and the powerful but you to connect to the world outside of right here beyond the walls of your bedroom beyond your in unprecedented ways today all you need to get to get a voice out there is one glowing rectangle and some bandwidth this means that you no longer have to be part of some elite class to share your ideas with the world right thanks to smartphones and YouTube you can be this 10 year old kid sitting in his mom's after basketball practice Nyame is one example that says a lot about why we might be smarter as a society to get out of the way and invest more time in young people sharing their thoughts and ideas there are lots of other reasons for this really it just makes good sense you all are the ones that have the biggest the largest amount of time left to solve the big problems that we have not really been able to make too much of a dent in also you're naturally better equipped than we are to solve these problems you all are the first native speakers of this digital language you're the ones who are experts at Twitter and snapchat and whatever that new thing is that's probably come out during the time that I've been speaking that you've already mastered I think Celia over there probably already has 12 viral snap twit chats whatever the new thing is gonna be called already experts at it this is something that is additionally important because you all don't see things that can't be done you see things you haven't done yet you naturally question what we old consider to be the status quo because quite frankly your status hasn't been quote yet like to me this is the box that my Vitamix came in I don't I don't have a Vitamix I don't know why I said that to me this is a box to a seven-year-old it's a lab for doing experiments or a sweet plane to practice your upside down flight loops in or something that can take you all the way to Pluto because when you're seven you don't judge Pluto for having its planetary status downgraded you think sweet Pluto I am totally going there you'll pick the uncomfortable fight that we tiptoe around every day you'll name the elephant in the room because there's a freaking elephant in the room okay so this is these are the reasons that I think that you all are better equipped to handle these problems than we are so y'all got this all right Celia you're in charge no I'm kidding I'm kidding but this is the kind of thing that we actually do right we say that youth voice is important but that's a lot different than really giving it space to flourish it's a lot different than actually listening so I did a lot of prep as any expert would for this talk but what struck me was that I what I probably should do is get out of the way work to create some space for young people to share their ideas and then step aside which is exactly what my program there are over two billion school-aged individuals living in the world today that's more young people than any other time in human history and it's this generations creativity their actions their art their poetry their protests their questions their code their dreams it's this generations ideas that will define the future of our world one well articulated idea can reach and inspire millions that's why Ted's youth and education initiative Ted ed has created a program that's dedicated to sparking and celebrating the best ideas of young people around the world it was to create more confident individuals it was Eric lebas was won by us for the program is called ted-ed clubs it supports students in identifying their passions learning public speaking skills connecting with a global network of classrooms and sharing student ideas in the form of short TED style talks here's how it works participating students and teachers gain access to a free and flexible curriculum they can use to start a TED ed Club at their school each suggested meeting uses TED Talks to help students engage in critical thinking exercises and gain invaluable presentation skills in the final meeting students are invited to give their own TED talk and if they record their talk they can upload it to Ted Ed's award-winning platform where it can be referenced on a resume a college application and shared with participating clubs around the world over two billion young people empowered and encouraged to share their ideas imagine that future and bring TED ed clubs to your community today we are not the only organization that is trying to amplify youth voices FIRST Robotics inspires young people to become leaders in science and technology by having them design and build and program robots that solve real-world engineering challenges the YMCA Youth in government program encourages young people to take over state and national governments by researching debating and voting on policy issues that they care about for their own governments not that there's anything wrong with the way that my country or yours has been handling our governments lately the Stanford design schools project Wayfarer focuses on helping teens discover and navigate a path for their future for your future based on your unique qualities rather than some prepackaged school subjects each of these efforts have same fundamental assumption you have something uniquely valuable to say right now not in some distant future time when all of a sudden you go from becoming the leaders of tomorrow to right now leaders so what kinds of things do we talk about what kinds of things are on your mind well society like feeds off of insecurity and I think everyone should learn to like your peers and they know your bullying stress body image have been viewed on our platform over a million times these students are leaders right now in today's world everywhere you go is a potential stage your kitchen your mom's front seat your classroom and many of you are carrying a device in your pocket that will carry your thoughts your dreams your voice across the world you can connect to other cultures and perspectives you can brainstorm and collaborate in ways that I will never be able to understand because I don't get snapchat filters and I never will most importantly though you're all carrying a story that is uniquely yours it is your something to say just like this young girl has her something to say right on the tip of her tongue this moment frozen in time represents you and the millions of young people just like you and also not at all like you who will have thoughts ideas questions and curiosities and if you're brave enough to say it to share it it can travel farther and do more good now than any other time in history so I'm gonna get off the stage now because it's your turn what do you want to do with it thank you [Applause]

**Transcript**:
As a matter of fact, I was trying to think about my career
since I left the White House, and the best example I have is a cartoon
in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up
at his father, and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a former president." (Laughter) Well, I have had a great blessing
as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people
in the world have ever had to get to know so many people
around this whole universe. Not only am I familiar
with the 50 states in the United States, but also my wife and I have visited
more than 145 countries in the world, and the Carter Center has had full-time
programs in 80 nations on Earth. And a lot of times,
when we go into a country, we not only the meet
the king or the president, but we also meet the villagers who live
in the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment
at the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do,
I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse
of human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often,
is the abuse of women and girls. (Applause) There are a couple of reasons for this
that I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation
of religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament,
New Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men
who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches
and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules
to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated
to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem.
It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist,
a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach
Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention
in the year 2000 decided that women should play
a secondary position, a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests,
pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't
teach a man, and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures
are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer,
for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women
are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? Why should I pay them equal pay
for doing the same kind of work? The other very serious blight that causes this problem
is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing
tremendously around the world. In the United States of America,
for instance, we have had an enormous increase
in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities,
by putting them in prison. When I was in office
as governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans
were in prison. Nowadays, 7.3 people
per 1,000 are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase
in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have
[one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty
that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside
the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights
in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now,
and I figured out the other day that California has spent
four billion dollars in convicting 13 people
for the death penalty. If you add that up, that's 307 million
dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law
abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much. (Applause) So the resort to violence and abuse
of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase
in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few
abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
a limited amount of time, as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible
and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl,
very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away
by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and,
in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts
of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes, in more extreme cases
but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl
can just urinate or menstruate. And then later, when she gets married,
the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up
so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing, although
it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females
that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries,
it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way
before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing
is honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation,
again, of a holy scripture -- there's nothing in the Quran
that mandates this -- will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man
that her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she
wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members
of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings
so-called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt
not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent
of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father,
the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders
are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women
particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about 12.5 million people
sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in
the 19th century and the 18th century. There are 30 million people
now living in slavery. The United States Department of State
now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports
that 800,000 people are sold across international borders
every year into slavery, and that 80 percent
of those sold are women, into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living
in human bondage, or slavery. Atlanta, Georgia, where
the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women,
people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place
in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest
airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers
that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl
that has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars. A white-skinned girl brings
several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia. So this is another very serious problem,
and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not
a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief
of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one
of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought
increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps
and the male customers are prosecuted, and -- (Applause) --
prostitution has gone down. In the United States, we take
just the opposite position. For every male arrested
for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested
in the United States of America. Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now
towards this so-called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions
in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great
university system. In the military, they are now analyzing
how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got,
there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000. Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding
officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine,
or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer
has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want
is for anybody to know that under their command,
sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls
who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted
before she graduates, and this is now getting
a lot of publicity, partially because of my book,
but other things, and so 89 universities in America
are now condemned by the Department of Education
under Title IX because the officials of the universities
are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says
that more than half of the rapes on a college campus
take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody,
they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus,
they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things
that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious
about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know. (Applause) And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now
gets 23 percent less than a man. When I became president,
the difference was 39 percent. So we've made some progress,
partially because I was president and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) -- but in the last 15 years,
there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23
or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well, that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike
nation on Earth. We have been to war
with about 25 different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes, we've had soldiers
on the ground fighting. The other times,
we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times, of course, now, we have
drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war
with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years,
I won't say which ones, where we didn't -- (Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway, those kinds of things,
the resort to violence and the misinterpretation
of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes,
of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause
that I need not mention, and that is that in general,
men don't give a damn. (Applause)
That's true. The average man that might say,
I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged
position that we occupy, and this is very similar
to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination, legally,
had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War
Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time,
there were many white people that didn't think that
racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges
of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing
that exists today, because the average man
really doesn't care. Even though they say, "I'm against
discrimination against girls and women," they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get
the majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control
the military system, the majority of men that control
the governments of the world, and the majority of men that control
the great religions. So what is the basic thing
that we need to do today? I would say the best thing
that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence
and who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility
on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination
against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say
about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down
to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here 
will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses
and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters
and your granddaughters. I have 12 grandchildren,
four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they
will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt
or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women
and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much. (Applause)

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the proportion of girls who enter American universities and are sexually assaulted before graduation.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of content and intent, I would suggest:

**Generated MCQ Index: None (but Question 5 is the closest in terms of topic)**

To create a more similar generated MCQ, I would suggest:

**New Generated MCQ: About 1 out of ___ girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates. Options: A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5 Correct Option: C**

This new generated MCQ exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As a matter of fact, I was trying to think about my career
since I left the White House, and the best example I have is a cartoon
in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up
at his father, and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a former president." (Laughter) Well, I have had a great blessing
as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people
in the world have ever had to get to know so many people
around this whole universe. Not only am I familiar
with the 50 states in the United States, but also my wife and I have visited
more than 145 countries in the world, and the Carter Center has had full-time
programs in 80 nations on Earth. And a lot of times,
when we go into a country, we not only the meet
the king or the president, but we also meet the villagers who live
in the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment
at the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do,
I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse
of human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often,
is the abuse of women and girls. (Applause) There are a couple of reasons for this
that I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation
of religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament,
New Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men
who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches
and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules
to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated
to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem.
It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist,
a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach
Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention
in the year 2000 decided that women should play
a secondary position, a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests,
pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't
teach a man, and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures
are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer,
for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women
are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? Why should I pay them equal pay
for doing the same kind of work? The other very serious blight that causes this problem
is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing
tremendously around the world. In the United States of America,
for instance, we have had an enormous increase
in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities,
by putting them in prison. When I was in office
as governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans
were in prison. Nowadays, 7.3 people
per 1,000 are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase
in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have
[one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty
that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside
the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights
in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now,
and I figured out the other day that California has spent
four billion dollars in convicting 13 people
for the death penalty. If you add that up, that's 307 million
dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law
abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much. (Applause) So the resort to violence and abuse
of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase
in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few
abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
a limited amount of time, as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible
and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl,
very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away
by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and,
in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts
of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes, in more extreme cases
but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl
can just urinate or menstruate. And then later, when she gets married,
the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up
so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing, although
it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females
that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries,
it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way
before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing
is honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation,
again, of a holy scripture -- there's nothing in the Quran
that mandates this -- will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man
that her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she
wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members
of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings
so-called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt
not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent
of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father,
the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders
are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women
particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about 12.5 million people
sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in
the 19th century and the 18th century. There are 30 million people
now living in slavery. The United States Department of State
now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports
that 800,000 people are sold across international borders
every year into slavery, and that 80 percent
of those sold are women, into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living
in human bondage, or slavery. Atlanta, Georgia, where
the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women,
people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place
in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest
airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers
that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl
that has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars. A white-skinned girl brings
several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia. So this is another very serious problem,
and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not
a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief
of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one
of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought
increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps
and the male customers are prosecuted, and -- (Applause) --
prostitution has gone down. In the United States, we take
just the opposite position. For every male arrested
for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested
in the United States of America. Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now
towards this so-called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions
in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great
university system. In the military, they are now analyzing
how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got,
there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000. Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding
officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine,
or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer
has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want
is for anybody to know that under their command,
sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls
who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted
before she graduates, and this is now getting
a lot of publicity, partially because of my book,
but other things, and so 89 universities in America
are now condemned by the Department of Education
under Title IX because the officials of the universities
are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says
that more than half of the rapes on a college campus
take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody,
they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus,
they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things
that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious
about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know. (Applause) And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now
gets 23 percent less than a man. When I became president,
the difference was 39 percent. So we've made some progress,
partially because I was president and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) -- but in the last 15 years,
there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23
or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well, that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike
nation on Earth. We have been to war
with about 25 different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes, we've had soldiers
on the ground fighting. The other times,
we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times, of course, now, we have
drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war
with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years,
I won't say which ones, where we didn't -- (Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway, those kinds of things,
the resort to violence and the misinterpretation
of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes,
of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause
that I need not mention, and that is that in general,
men don't give a damn. (Applause)
That's true. The average man that might say,
I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged
position that we occupy, and this is very similar
to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination, legally,
had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War
Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time,
there were many white people that didn't think that
racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges
of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing
that exists today, because the average man
really doesn't care. Even though they say, "I'm against
discrimination against girls and women," they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get
the majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control
the military system, the majority of men that control
the governments of the world, and the majority of men that control
the great religions. So what is the basic thing
that we need to do today? I would say the best thing
that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence
and who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility
on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination
against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say
about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down
to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here 
will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses
and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters
and your granddaughters. I have 12 grandchildren,
four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they
will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt
or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women
and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: What process is used to create aerogels, and what is replaced in the solid molecular structure to create a porous, lightweight material?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the properties and creation of aerogels. Although the question phrasing is different, the content and intent are similar.

The correct option in Question 2 (B. Liquid is replaced by a gas at extremely high temperatures and pressures through a process involving a supercritical fluid.) is related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (D. All of the above), which mentions extremely high temperatures and pressures as one of the factors that contribute to the strength and stability of aerogels.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ. However, the most relevant generated MCQ related to the topic of invisibility cloaks is Question 5.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what muggle researchers need to experiment with to make an invisibility cloak like in "Harry Potter", and the correct answer is "Light". 

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about what is needed to make an invisibility cloak, it does discuss the challenges of scaling up the invisibility cloak technology, which involves designing gold antennas that can counteract light distortion.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly asks about the material or phenomenon that researchers need to experiment with to create an invisibility cloak.

However, given the available options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 5, with the understanding that it is not a direct match.

However, the best match is:

**None of the above questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ.**

But if I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but if I had to choose from the existing questions:

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

Question 4: How do scientists create materials that mimic the waterproof surfaces found in nature, such as the lotus leaf or butterfly wings? 
Options: A. By using smooth surfaces, B. By creating microscopically rough surfaces, C. By applying a layer of oil, D. By using UV light 
Correct Option: B

This question is related to the concept of super-hydrophobic materials, which is the topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, the question is not a direct match, as it asks about the method of creating such materials, rather than the behavior of water droplets on their surface.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, with an index of 4. However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more precise question would be needed to fully match the ground truth MCQ.

things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical

**Transcript**:
So say you just moved from England to the US and you've got your old school supplies from England and your new school supplies from the US and it's your first day of school and you get to class and find that your new American paper doesn't fit in your old English binder. The paper is too wide, and hangs out. So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper. And to keep yourself amused during your math class you start playing with them. And by you, I mean Arthur H. Stone in 1939. Anyway, there's lots of cool things you can do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into shapes. And more shapes. Maybe spiral it around snugly like this. Maybe make it into a square. Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts. In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip, and then your hexagon is pretty stable. And you're like, "I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting, but I guess it has symmetry or something." Maybe you could kinda fold it so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up. That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles, which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are, you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little bit during your class. And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry, you decide to try this three-way fold the other way, with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up. What? You close it back up and undo it. Everything seems the same as before, the center is not open-uppable. But when you fold it that way again, it, like, flips inside-out. Weird. This time, instead of going backwards, you try doing it again. And again. And again. And again. And you want to make one that's a little less messy, so you try again with another strip and tape it nicely into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide that it would be cool to color the sides, so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow. Now you can flip from yellow side to white side. Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go? So you go back, and this time you color the white side green, and find that your paper has three sides. Yellow, white, and green. Now this thing is definitely cool. Therefore, you need to name it. And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is. That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking about hexaflexagons. And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class you pull out your paper strips. You had made this sort of spirally folded paper that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper, and you decide to take that And use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon. Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier with the extra paper. And you color the three sides and are like, Orange, yellow, pink. And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class. Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second. Okay, so you color that one green. And now it's orange, yellow, green. Orange, yellow, green. Who knows where the pink side went? Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh. With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way, flappy way up. But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways. Yes, one goes from pink to blue, but the other, from pink to orange. And now, one way goes from orange to yellow, but the other way goes from orange to...neon yellow. During lunch you want to show this off to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman. You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon, which you call the trihexaflexagon. And he's like, whoa! and wants to learn how to make one. And you're like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip, fold it into equilateral triangles, and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric. The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not, then you're doing it wrong. And then you just tape the first triangle to the last along the edge, and you're good. But Tuckerman doesn't have tape. After all, it was invented only 10 years ago. So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine, and then glues the first to the last. Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it flat and trianglly, and then opening from the center. You decide to start a flexagon commitee together to explore the mysteries of flexagation. But that will have to wait until next time.

**Transcript**:
So say you just moved from England to the US and you've got your old school supplies from England and your new school supplies from the US and it's your first day of school and you get to class and find that your new American paper doesn't fit in your old English binder. The paper is too wide, and hangs out. So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper. And to keep yourself amused during your math class you start playing with them. And by you, I mean Arthur H. Stone in 1939. Anyway, there's lots of cool things you can do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into shapes. And more shapes. Maybe spiral it around snugly like this. Maybe make it into a square. Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts. In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip, and then your hexagon is pretty stable. And you're like, "I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting, but I guess it has symmetry or something." Maybe you could kinda fold it so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up. That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles, which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are, you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little bit during your class. And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry, you decide to try this three-way fold the other way, with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up. What? You close it back up and undo it. Everything seems the same as before, the center is not open-uppable. But when you fold it that way again, it, like, flips inside-out. Weird. This time, instead of going backwards, you try doing it again. And again. And again. And again. And you want to make one that's a little less messy, so you try again with another strip and tape it nicely into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide that it would be cool to color the sides, so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow. Now you can flip from yellow side to white side. Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go? So you go back, and this time you color the white side green, and find that your paper has three sides. Yellow, white, and green. Now this thing is definitely cool. Therefore, you need to name it. And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is. That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking about hexaflexagons. And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class you pull out your paper strips. You had made this sort of spirally folded paper that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper, and you decide to take that And use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon. Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier with the extra paper. And you color the three sides and are like, Orange, yellow, pink. And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class. Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second. Okay, so you color that one green. And now it's orange, yellow, green. Orange, yellow, green. Who knows where the pink side went? Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh. With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way, flappy way up. But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways. Yes, one goes from pink to blue, but the other, from pink to orange. And now, one way goes from orange to yellow, but the other way goes from orange to...neon yellow. During lunch you want to show this off to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman. You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon, which you call the trihexaflexagon. And he's like, whoa! and wants to learn how to make one. And you're like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip, fold it into equilateral triangles, and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric. The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not, then you're doing it wrong. And then you just tape the first triangle to the last along the edge, and you're good. But Tuckerman doesn't have tape. After all, it was invented only 10 years ago. So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine, and then glues the first to the last. Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it flat and trianglly, and then opening from the center. You decide to start a flexagon commitee together to explore the mysteries of flexagation. But that will have to wait until next time.

**Transcript**:
This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of species of songbirds. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions "songbirds" and discusses their behavior, which is the closest match in terms of topic.

However, if I had to choose a question that is vaguely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 9, which asks about an example of a genetically encoded or innate behavior in the animal kingdom, apart from songbirds. This question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, but it does mention a specific fact about the animal kingdom, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But since none of the questions match closely, I will not provide an index.

However, I can suggest a way to create a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Here is an example:

**Transcript**:
This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?

**Transcript**:
This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?

Reviewer: Camille Martínez I want you to look
around the room for a minute and try to find the most
paranoid person here -- (Laughter) And then I want you to point
at that person for me. (Laughter) OK, don't actually do it. (Laughter) But, as an organizational psychologist, I spend a lot of time in workplaces, and I find paranoia everywhere. Paranoia is caused by people
that I call "takers." Takers are self-serving
in their interactions. It's all about what can you do for me. The opposite is a giver. It's somebody who approaches
most interactions by asking, "What can I do for you?" I wanted to give you a chance
to think about your own style. We all have moments of giving and taking. Your style is how you treat
most of the people most of the time, your default. I have a short test you can take to figure out if you're more
of a giver or a taker, and you can take it right now. [The Narcissist Test] [Step 1: Take a moment
to think about yourself.] (Laughter) [Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,
you are not a narcissist.] (Laughter) This is the only thing I will say today
that has no data behind it, but I am convinced the longer it takes
for you to laugh at this cartoon, the more worried we should be
that you're a taker. (Laughter) Of course, not all takers are narcissists. Some are just givers who got burned
one too many times. Then there's another kind of taker
that we won't be addressing today, and that's called a psychopath. (Laughter) I was curious, though, about how
common these extremes are, and so I surveyed over 30,000
people across industries around the world's cultures. And I found that most people
are right in the middle between giving and taking. They choose this third style
called "matching." If you're a matcher, you try to keep
an even balance of give and take: quid pro quo -- I'll do something
for you if you do something for me. And that seems like a safe way
to live your life. But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life? The answer to that question
is a very definitive ... maybe. (Laughter) I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring
their productivity. (Laughter) I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue. (Laughter) And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers. The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors
than they got back. They were so busy doing
other people's jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed. In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students who agree most strongly
with statements like, "I love helping others," which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody. (Laughter) And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople. I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score. And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --" I didn't ask it that way, but -- (Laughter) "What's the cost of generosity in sales?" And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products." (Laughter) So just out of curiosity, how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers? Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data. But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here, because givers are often
sacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better. We have a huge body of evidence -- many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team
or an organization -- and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure: higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention -- even lower operating expenses. So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way. I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed. So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers, who are the best performers? Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers. Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers. If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world. And so when you meet a taker, you feel like it's your mission in life to just punish the hell
out of that person. (Laughter) And that way justice gets served. Well, most people are matchers. And that means if you're a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually; what goes around will come around. And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers
who are the best performers. But they're not. In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied, the best results belong
to the givers again. Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue. What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes. They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue. The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity and medical students' grades. Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Which raises the question: How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel? I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools -- even governments. Are you ready? (Cheers) I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm. (Laughter) The first thing that's really critical is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people, but if they're not careful, they burn out. So you have to protect
the givers in your midst. And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker. It's the guy, not the cat. (Laughter) His name is Adam Rifkin. He's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people. And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor. Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver. You just have to find small ways
to add large value to other people's lives." That could be as simple
as making an introduction between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other. It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback. Or It might be even something
as basic as saying, "You know, I'm going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed." And those five-minute favors
are really critical to helping givers set boundaries
and protect themselves. The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture
where givers succeed, is you actually need a culture
where help-seeking is the norm; where people ask a lot. This may hit a little too close
to home for some of you. [So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?] (Laughter) What you see with successful givers is they recognize that it's OK
to be a receiver, too. If you run an organization,
we can actually make this easier. We can make it easier
for people to ask for help. A couple colleagues and I
studied hospitals. We found that on certain floors,
nurses did a lot of help-seeking, and on other floors,
they did very little of it. The factor that stood out on the floors
where help-seeking was common, where it was the norm, was there was just one nurse
whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit. When that role was available, nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,
it's not vulnerable to ask for help -- it's actually encouraged." Help-seeking isn't important
just for protecting the success and the well-being of givers. It's also critical to getting
more people to act like givers, because the data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
of all giving in organizations starts with a request. But a lot of people don't ask. They don't want to look incompetent, they don't know where to turn,
they don't want to burden others. Yet if nobody ever asks for help, you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization who would love to step up and contribute, if they only knew
who could benefit and how. But I think the most important thing, if you want to build a culture
of successful givers, is to be thoughtful about who
you let onto your team. I figured, you want a culture
of productive generosity, you should hire a bunch of givers. But I was surprised to discover, actually,
that that was not right -- that the negative impact
of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple
the positive impact of a giver. Think about it this way: one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg
just does not make a dozen. I don't know what that means -- (Laughter) But I hope you do. No -- let even one taker into a team, and you will see that the givers
will stop helping. They'll say, "I'm surrounded
by a bunch of snakes and sharks. Why should I contribute?" Whereas if you let one giver into a team, you don't get an explosion of generosity. More often, people are like, "Great! That person can do all our work." So, effective hiring and screening
and team building is not about bringing in the givers; it's about weeding out the takers. If you can do that well, you'll be left with givers and matchers. The givers will be generous because they don't have to worry
about the consequences. And the beauty of the matchers
is that they follow the norm. So how do you catch a taker
before it's too late? We're actually pretty bad
at figuring out who's a taker, especially on first impressions. There's a personality trait
that throws us off. It's called agreeableness, one the major dimensions
of personality across cultures. Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
they're nice, they're polite. You find a lot of them in Canada -- (Laughter) Where there was actually
a national contest to come up with a new Canadian slogan
and fill in the blank, "As Canadian as ..." I thought the winning entry
was going to be, "As Canadian as maple syrup,"
or, "... ice hockey." But no, Canadians voted
for their new national slogan to be -- I kid you not -- "As Canadian as possible
under the circumstances." (Laughter) Now for those of you
who are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away. How could I ever say I'm any one thing when I'm constantly adapting
to try to please other people? Disagreeable people do less of it. They're more critical,
skeptical, challenging, and far more likely than their peers
to go to law school. (Laughter) That's not a joke,
that's actually an empirical fact. (Laughter) So I always assumed
that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers. But then I gathered the data, and I was stunned to find
no correlation between those traits, because it turns out
that agreeableness-disagreeableness is your outer veneer: How pleasant is it to interact with you? Whereas giving and taking
are more of your inner motives: What are your values?
What are your intentions toward others? If you really want to judge
people accurately, you have to get to the moment every
consultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two-by-two. (Laughter) The agreeable givers are easy to spot: they say yes to everything. The disagreeable takers
are also recognized quickly, although you might call them
by a slightly different name. (Laughter) We forget about the other
two combinations. There are disagreeable givers
in our organizations. There are people who are gruff
and tough on the surface but underneath have
others' best interests at heart. Or as an engineer put it, "Oh, disagreeable givers -- like somebody with a bad user interface
but a great operating system." (Laughter) If that helps you. (Laughter) Disagreeable givers are the most
undervalued people in our organizations, because they're the ones
who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear
but everyone needs to hear. We need to do a much better job
valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early, and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly, must be a selfish taker." The other combination we forget about
is the deadly one -- the agreeable taker,
also known as the faker. This is the person
who's nice to your face, and then will stab you right in the back. (Laughter) And my favorite way to catch
these people in the interview process is to ask the question, "Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have
fundamentally improved?" The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more
influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up
and then kicking down. Givers are more likely to name people
who are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good. And let's face it, you all know
you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone
treats their restaurant server or their Uber driver. So if we do all this well, if we can weed takers
out of organizations, if we can make it safe to ask for help, if we can protect givers from burnout and make it OK for them to be ambitious
in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people, we can actually change the way
that people define success. Instead of saying it's all about
winning a competition, people will realize success
is really more about contribution. I believe that the most
meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed. And if we can spread that belief, we can actually turn paranoia upside down. There's a name for that. It's called "pronoia." Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people
are plotting your well-being. (Laughter) That they're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally
glowing things about you. The great thing about a culture of givers
is that's not a delusion -- it's reality. I want to live in a world
where givers succeed, and I hope you will help me
create that world. Thank you. (Applause)

for you if you do something for me. And that seems like a safe way
to live your life. But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life? The answer to that question
is a very definitive ... maybe. (Laughter) I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring
their productivity. (Laughter) I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue. (Laughter) And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers. The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors
than they got back. They were so busy doing
other people's jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed. In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students who agree most strongly
with statements like, "I love helping others," which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody. (Laughter) And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople. I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score. And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --" I didn't ask it that way, but -- (Laughter) "What's the cost of generosity in sales?" And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products." (Laughter) So just out of curiosity, how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers? Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data. But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here, because givers are often
sacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better. We have a huge body of evidence -- many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team
or an organization -- and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure: higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention -- even lower operating expenses. So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way. I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed. So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers, who are the best performers? Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers. Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers. If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world. And so when you meet a taker, you feel like it's your mission in life to just punish the hell
out of that person. (Laughter) And that way justice gets served. Well, most people are matchers. And that means if you're a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually; what goes around will come around. And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers
who are the best performers. But they're not. In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied, the best results belong
to the givers again. Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue. What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes. They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue. The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity and medical students' grades. Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Which raises the question: How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel? I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools -- even governments. Are you ready? (Cheers) I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm. (Laughter) The first thing that's really critical is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people, but if they're not careful, they burn out. So you have to protect
the givers in your midst. And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker. It's the guy, not the cat. (Laughter) His name is Adam Rifkin. He's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people. And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor. Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver. You just have to find small ways
to add large value to other people's lives." That could be as simple
as making an introduction between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other. It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback. Or It might be even something
as basic as saying, "You know, I'm going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed." And those five-minute favors
are really critical to helping givers set boundaries
and protect themselves. The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture
where givers succeed, is you actually need a culture
where help-seeking is the norm; where people ask a lot. This may hit a little too close
to home for some of you. [So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?] (Laughter) What you see with successful givers is they recognize that it's OK
to be a receiver, too. If you run an organization,
we can actually make this easier. We can make it easier
for people to ask for help. A couple colleagues and I
studied hospitals. We found that on certain floors,
nurses did a lot of help-seeking, and on other floors,
they did very little of it. The factor that stood out on the floors
where help-seeking was common, where it was the norm, was there was just one nurse
whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit. When that role was available, nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,
it's not vulnerable to ask for help -- it's actually encouraged." Help-seeking isn't important
just for protecting the success and the well-being of givers. It's also critical to getting
more people to act like givers, because the data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
of all giving in organizations starts with a request. But a lot of people don't ask. They don't want to look incompetent, they don't know where to turn,
they don't want to burden others. Yet if nobody ever asks for help, you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization who would love to step up and contribute, if they only knew
who could benefit and how. But I think the most important thing, if you want to build a culture
of successful givers, is to be thoughtful about who
you let onto your team. I figured, you want a culture
of productive generosity, you should hire a bunch of givers. But I was surprised to discover, actually,
that that was not right -- that the negative impact
of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple
the positive impact of a giver. Think about it this way: one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg
just does not make a dozen. I don't know what that means -- (Laughter) But I hope you do. No -- let even one taker into a team, and you will see that the givers
will stop helping. They'll say, "I'm surrounded
by a bunch of snakes and sharks. Why should I contribute?" Whereas if you let one giver into a team, you don't get an explosion of generosity. More often, people are like, "Great! That person can do all our work." So, effective hiring and screening
and team building is not about bringing in the givers; it's about weeding out the takers. If you can do that well, you'll be left with givers and matchers. The givers will be generous because they don't have to worry
about the consequences. And the beauty of the matchers
is that they follow the norm. So how do you catch a taker
before it's too late? We're actually pretty bad
at figuring out who's a taker, especially on first impressions. There's a personality trait
that throws us off. It's called agreeableness, one the major dimensions
of personality across cultures. Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
they're nice, they're polite. You find a lot of them in Canada -- (Laughter) Where there was actually
a national contest to come up with a new Canadian slogan
and fill in the blank, "As Canadian as ..." I thought the winning entry
was going to be, "As Canadian as maple syrup,"
or, "... ice hockey." But no, Canadians voted
for their new national slogan to be -- I kid you not -- "As Canadian as possible
under the circumstances." (Laughter) Now for those of you
who are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away. How could I ever say I'm any one thing when I'm constantly adapting
to try to please other people? Disagreeable people do less of it. They're more critical,
skeptical, challenging, and far more likely than their peers
to go to law school. (Laughter) That's not a joke,
that's actually an empirical fact. (Laughter) So I always assumed
that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers. But then I gathered the data, and I was stunned to find
no correlation between those traits, because it turns out
that agreeableness-disagreeableness is your outer veneer: How pleasant is it to interact with you? Whereas giving and taking
are more of your inner motives: What are your values?
What are your intentions toward others? If you really want to judge
people accurately, you have to get to the moment every
consultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two-by-two. (Laughter) The agreeable givers are easy to spot: they say yes to everything. The disagreeable takers
are also recognized quickly, although you might call them
by a slightly different name. (Laughter) We forget about the other
two combinations. There are disagreeable givers
in our organizations. There are people who are gruff
and tough on the surface but underneath have
others' best interests at heart. Or as an engineer put it, "Oh, disagreeable givers -- like somebody with a bad user interface
but a great operating system." (Laughter) If that helps you. (Laughter) Disagreeable givers are the most
undervalued people in our organizations, because they're the ones
who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear
but everyone needs to hear. We need to do a much better job
valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early, and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly, must be a selfish taker." The other combination we forget about
is the deadly one -- the agreeable taker,
also known as the faker. This is the person
who's nice to your face, and then will stab you right in the back. (Laughter) And my favorite way to catch
these people in the interview process is to ask the question, "Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have
fundamentally improved?" The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more
influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up
and then kicking down. Givers are more likely to name people
who are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good. And let's face it, you all know
you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone
treats their restaurant server or their Uber driver. So if we do all this well, if we can weed takers
out of organizations, if we can make it safe to ask for help, if we can protect givers from burnout and make it OK for them to be ambitious
in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people, we can actually change the way
that people define success. Instead of saying it's all about
winning a competition, people will realize success
is really more about contribution. I believe that the most
meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed. And if we can spread that belief, we can actually turn paranoia upside down. There's a name for that. It's called "pronoia." Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people
are plotting your well-being. (Laughter) That they're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally
glowing things about you. The great thing about a culture of givers
is that's not a delusion -- it's reality. I want to live in a world
where givers succeed, and I hope you will help me
create that world. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
When the Wright brothers
had to decide who would be the first to 
fly their new airplane off a sand dune, 
they flipped a coin. That was fair: we all know there’s an equal chance 
of getting heads and tails. But what if they had 
a more complicated contest? What if they flipped coins repeatedly, so that Orville would win as soon as 
two heads showed up in a row on his coin, and Wilbur would win as soon as heads 
was immediately followed by tails on his? Would each brother still have had an equal
chance to be the first in flight? At first, it may seem they’d still have 
the same chance of winning. There are four combinations
for two consecutive flips. And if you do flip a coin just twice, there’s an equal chance 
of each one -- 25%. So your intuition might tell you 
that in any string of coin flips, each combination would have 
the same shot at appearing first. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Wilbur actually has
a big advantage in this contest. Imagine our sequence of coin flips 
as a sort of board game, where every flip determines which
path we take. The goal is to get from start to finish. The heads/tails board looks like this. And this is the head/head board. There’s one critical difference. Heads/heads has a move that sends you 
all the way back to the start that heads/tails doesn’t have. That’s why heads/heads
takes longer on average. So we can demonstrate that this is true
using probability and algebra to calculate the average number of flips
it would take to get each combination. Let’s start with the heads/tails board, and define x to be the average 
number of flips to advance one step. Focus only on the arrows. It has two identical steps, each with a 50/50 chance of staying 
in place or moving forward. Option 1: If we stay in place by getting 
tails, we waste one flip. Since we’re back in the same place, on average we must flip x more times 
to advance one step. Together with that first flip, this gives an average of x + 1 
total flips to advance. Option 2: If we get heads 
and move forward, then we have taken exactly one total flip 
to advance one step. We can now combine option 1 
and option 2 with their probabilities to get this expression. Solving that for x gives us an average 
of two moves to advance one step. Since each step is identical, we can multiply by two and arrive
at four flips to advance two steps. For heads/heads, 
the picture isn’t as simple. This time, let y be the average number 
of flips to move from start to finish. There are two options for the first move, 
each with 50/50 odds. Option 1 is the same as before, getting tails sends us back to the start, giving an average 
of y+1 total flips to finish. In Option 2, there are two equally 
likely cases for the next flip. With heads we’d be done after two flips. But tails would return us to the start. Since we’d return after two flips, we’d then need an average
of y+2 flips in total to finish. So our full expression will be this. And solving this equation 
gives us six flips. So the math calculates that it takes an
average of six flips to get heads/heads, and an average of four 
to get heads/tails. And, in fact, that’s what you’d see if you
tested it for yourself enough times. Of course, the Wright brothers didn’t 
need to work all this out; they only flipped the coin once,
and Wilbur won. But it didn’t matter: 
Wilbur’s flight failed, and Orville made 
aviation history, instead. Tough luck, Wilbur.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the options in Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ (it asks about "heads/tails" instead of "tails immediately followed by heads"), the question intent and content are similar. Both questions ask about the average number of flips required to achieve a specific sequence of coin flips.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If a new generated MCQ were created that asked about "tails immediately followed by heads" with the same options as the ground truth MCQ, that would be an even closer match.

chance to be the first in flight? At first, it may seem they’d still have 
the same chance of winning. There are four combinations
for two consecutive flips. And if you do flip a coin just twice, there’s an equal chance 
of each one -- 25%. So your intuition might tell you 
that in any string of coin flips, each combination would have 
the same shot at appearing first. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Wilbur actually has
a big advantage in this contest. Imagine our sequence of coin flips 
as a sort of board game, where every flip determines which
path we take. The goal is to get from start to finish. The heads/tails board looks like this. And this is the head/head board. There’s one critical difference. Heads/heads has a move that sends you 
all the way back to the start that heads/tails doesn’t have. That’s why heads/heads
takes longer on average. So we can demonstrate that this is true
using probability and algebra to calculate the average number of flips
it would take to get each combination. Let’s start with the heads/tails board, and define x to be the average 
number of flips to advance one step. Focus only on the arrows. It has two identical steps, each with a 50/50 chance of staying 
in place or moving forward. Option 1: If we stay in place by getting 
tails, we waste one flip. Since we’re back in the same place, on average we must flip x more times 
to advance one step. Together with that first flip, this gives an average of x + 1 
total flips to advance. Option 2: If we get heads 
and move forward, then we have taken exactly one total flip 
to advance one step. We can now combine option 1 
and option 2 with their probabilities to get this expression. Solving that for x gives us an average 
of two moves to advance one step. Since each step is identical, we can multiply by two and arrive
at four flips to advance two steps. For heads/heads, 
the picture isn’t as simple. This time, let y be the average number 
of flips to move from start to finish. There are two options for the first move, 
each with 50/50 odds. Option 1 is the same as before, getting tails sends us back to the start, giving an average 
of y+1 total flips to finish. In Option 2, there are two equally 
likely cases for the next flip. With heads we’d be done after two flips. But tails would return us to the start. Since we’d return after two flips, we’d then need an average
of y+2 flips in total to finish. So our full expression will be this. And solving this equation 
gives us six flips. So the math calculates that it takes an
average of six flips to get heads/heads, and an average of four 
to get heads/tails. And, in fact, that’s what you’d see if you
tested it for yourself enough times. Of course, the Wright brothers didn’t 
need to work all this out; they only flipped the coin once,
and Wilbur won. But it didn’t matter: 
Wilbur’s flight failed, and Orville made 
aviation history, instead. Tough luck, Wilbur.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the main difference between the "heads/heads" board and the "heads/tails" board in the author's analogy?**

Options: A. The number of steps required to win, B. The probability of getting heads or tails, C. The presence of a move that sends you back to the start, D. The color of the boards

Correct Option: C

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about what causes you to move from Start to H in either board, and the correct answer is "You were at Start and your next flip comes up heads." Question 8 asks about the main difference between the two boards, and the correct answer is related to the movement in the boards.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, I recommend creating a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **8**

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a new MCQ should be generated to more accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the expected outcome of the contest with multiple coin flips between Orville and Wilbur. The options are also similar, with the correct option (C) stating that Wilbur has a higher chance of winning. However, note that the ground truth MCQ actually states that the correct answer is "C. They have equal chances of winning", which is incorrect according to the transcript. The correct answer should be "B. Wilbur", as stated in the transcript. 

So, while Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ, it actually corrects the mistake in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try? Turns out there are. Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go? We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality it consists mostly of empty space With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years So our galaxy is... pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it's part of the "local group" a region of space about ten million light years in diameter It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster. Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics. In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening. Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the smallest scale, there is constant action. Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions. Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well, and subatomic distances became galactic distances. With dense, and less dense regions. After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together. At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious. So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe... grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait, what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here, dark energy makes everything complicated. About six billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly. In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group... that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away. But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match. We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded, the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years. But it becomes even more depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away... that they will be too faint to detect ... and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions, forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe! When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing what we know today. The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end. They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System... and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time, to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated and remote as the Local Group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now. Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the ground truth MCQ is related to the expansion of the observable universe, which is mentioned in the transcript as expanding from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in fractions of a second.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's still not a good match. Question 5 talks about the expansion of the universe, but it's focused on the galaxies outside of the Local Group moving away from us, whereas the ground truth MCQ is focused on the expansion of the observable universe itself.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try? Turns out there are. Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go? We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality it consists mostly of empty space With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years So our galaxy is... pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it's part of the "local group" a region of space about ten million light years in diameter It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster. Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics. In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening. Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the smallest scale, there is constant action. Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions. Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well, and subatomic distances became galactic distances. With dense, and less dense regions. After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together. At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious. So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe... grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait, what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here, dark energy makes everything complicated. About six billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly. In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group... that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away. But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match. We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded, the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years. But it becomes even more depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away... that they will be too faint to detect ... and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions, forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe! When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing what we know today. The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end. They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System... and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time, to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated and remote as the Local Group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now. Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.

**Transcript**:
[Subtitles submitted by: Zacháry Dorris] Today I want to let you in on a really neat trick that I learned from a very famous mathematician; how to subtract ∞ from ∞ to get exactly π. So for that I'll return to this blackboard here I found in the Simpsons, and I discussed in this video up there. And particularly that infinite series down there at the bottom. Okay, so it's 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5, all the way to infinity - an infinite series, with sum log 2 [ln(2)]. So that's about...0.69. What I want to do here is something that somebody discovered about 150 years ago So just, just see what I do, it's a bit of a paradox. So what I do is I take a bit more of this, and I really need the whole board, so we'll take out every fourth term, and then what's left over has odd denominator and even denominator terms, so let's separate those out, too. Now we're going to work our way in from the left, ah, pick those two guys  and put them down there, take those two guys, and put them down in the gap, take those two guys and put them down in the next gap, and you keep on going like this, and obviously when you do this, you use up all the terms that were there in the beginning, and just rearrange them here and rebracket them a little bit. Now we're going to work our way through the brackets, so first one here, (1 - 1/2) is 1/2. (1/3 - 1/6) is 1/6 And so on, right, so we can see how this works, this nice pattern here, um, that's what happens, so we've just rearranged the terms, and we rebracketed them a little bit, and that shouldn't change anything about the sum of this thing, right? So, if you compare what we've got now to what we started with, well, the bit that we started with is what? ln(2). But now we can compare term by term, so one half of 1 is 1/2. One half of 1/2 is 1/4. And half of 1/3 is 1/6, and so on, and so what you see is that term by term. The bit at the bottom here is always one half of the bit at the top, and so what it means is it should really be equal to ... 1/2*ln(2). Now if you put all this stuff together, you get ln(2) is equal to 1/2*ln(2),  which really amounts the same thing as saying that 1 is equal to 2. *groans tiredly* *laughing* and whenever you come across something like this, you start worrying. So there's really, you know, two different options here, the first one is maths is broken. Or, we made a mistake. What do you think is more likely here, well, yes, we made a mistake. So where's the mistake? So let's have a close look, so there was three different identities, so here, here, and there. So two of these are correct, and one of these is not correct. So, the first bit, well, I already said this, and just believe me, this is equal to ln(2). Then the bottom bit is also correct. In fact, that bracketing here, and I'll just say this now, you can put in brackets anywhere you want, it's not going to change anything about this sum here. It's always going to add up to 1/2*ln(2) here, that's correct. So what's really messing things up is that we are rearranging the terms, so we're changing the order of the terms. And that really creates an infinite series with a different sum than the one before. So basically when we're dealing with these infinite series, unlike with the finite ones, order matters, and rearranging may change the sum. Okay, well some people are getting really worried oh no,  maths is broken anyway, no it's not broken - we just have to get used to this. *laughs* we gotta be careful about this sort of stuffs. So we just saw that we can rearrange this series into another series with a different sum, and actually there's a famous mathematician, Riemann, Bernhard Riemann, who came up with a theorem, the Riemann rearrangement theorem, which says that, well, in this case of this particular series, you can rearrange this thing into series that add up to anything you want. For example, π, and I'm going to show you how that is done, how he...how he makes up these different sums. Now you've probably heard this name, the Riemann hypothesis, is at the moment the most sought after thing that you can prove in mathematics. So eternal fame awaits if you can do this, and that's all about the Riemann zeta function, and there's also the Riemann integral, which you use all the time, and lots and lots of Riemann named bits in mathematics, so this guy is  a mathematical superhero. Usually, when it comes to these things that are named after him, they are quite...difficult to explain properly, but that Riemann rearrangement theorem I can do like this with my animation magic. So let's just do it, but before we do it,  I really have to remind you of what it actually means for one of those series to add up to a certain number, okay, so what we do is we translate this, series, into a sequence of numbers, the 'partial sums', the sequence of partial sums. So the first partial sum is just the first term, which is 1, the second partial sum is just those two guys added up. That's...0.5 in this case, and then, third partial sum, fourth partial sum, and so you get this sequence of numbers here, and in the case of this series, the sequence of numbers 'converges' to a certain number. which is ln(2). And then we say that this series has sum, that number, ln(2) in this case. That's the definition of a sum of an infinite series. This is an example of a 'convergent' series. A series that actually has a sum which is a finite number. Ah, now there's also lots of series that don't converge. And they are called 'divergent'. So for example, if we replace all the minuses in here by pluses, I already showed in that other video up there, that this adds up to +∞. But there's other types of divergence, For example, if we take this guy there, that's 1 - 1 + 1 - 1+... ; the partial sums here are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 They don't settle down to anything; not finite, not infinite, that's also divergent. So there are different sorts of divergent. To explain what's going on here, let's have a look at the positive terms, and the negative terms separately. So if you just add up all the positive terms, you'll actually find you get ∞. And if you actually add up the negative terms, you get -∞. And, actually if you've watched the other video you should be able to prove that yourself, and maybe do it in the comments. So what we're really doing here is we're subtracting ∞ from ∞ in a controlled manner. What Riemann's rearrangement theorem says is that if you've got a convergent series, whose positive terms add up to ∞, and whose negative terms add up to -∞, then you can rearrange the series into series that have any sum you want. So let me demonstrate this now for π, with this particular series. Okay, so we want pi. [CAPTIONER'S NOTE: Don't we all, Mathologer :)] That's positive, so we're going to start with some positive terms. So the first term of my new series is going to be 1. So the first partial sum is also going to be 1. The partial sums, I put up there. Now, that is not enough, so we add a few more of those positive terms, let's get close to π. Now we actually have to add quite a few of them to get close to π, we are still just under here, so let's add one more, and that gets us just over. This string of terms, we choose as the beginning bit of our new series. So we're just over, now we're going to use some negative terms to get just under. Okay, so we use the, actually, the -1/2 is good enough, so, that gets us under. *thoughtful pause* 2.6 and so on. *dramatic pause* Alright, now let's go over again, so for that,  we'll just use some positive terms. Um, we actually need quite a few again, but we can be absolutely sure that we can get over because, at any stage of this process, the positive terms that are left over will add up to ∞, and the negative terms that are left over will add up to ∞, so I can always be sure that no matter how far I'm under, or how far I'm over, I can always take enough terms to get under or over. Alright, now we can just keep on going like this, so then a negative term to get us under again, then a positive, positive terms again to get us over, and we go, flip back and forth, and eventually we get to π. And we can also be sure that we get to π because the terms themselves, they get smaller and smaller in magnitude, so that means that as I overshoot and undershoot, I get closer and closer to π. And actually,  uh, I can rearrange this initial series in infinitely many ways, different ways, to get me π; I can also rearrange it to get me an infinite sum, all sorts of other things, so maybe you'll also want to do this in the comments, figure out the details there. Now, for other series, you can actually have the situation where nothing changes no matter what you do. So there's lots of convergent series where the positive terms add up to a positive number and the negative terms add up to a negative number, so for example, it could be, you know, 2, the positive terms, and minus 7, the negative terms. And then, no matter how you reshuffle,  this series, the sum will always be 2 - 7 is -5. Okay, now there's something else that we're actually doing here, we're actually bracketing, alright, so we're bracketing. So we can bracket like this, we can bracket like that, or maybe we don't do any brackets whatsoever, And actually, as long as we're dealing with, infinite series, that converge, either this type or of that type, doesn't matter what, you can put in brackets wherever you want, and the sum won't change. So I mean, that's a bit reassuring *chuckles anxiously* so, basically commutativity is broken, but but, uh, associativity, at least for convergent series, doesn't get mucked up, so it's quite nice. *excited* BUT, there's at least one more surprise happening here; that's just for convergent series. So if you actually look at some divergent series, strange things can happen even when you bracket them. So for example, this guy here, the 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 divergent series, if you just bracket it right, you'll actually get a convergent series. with a certain sum, and actually you can bracket this in many, many different ways, and get different sums out. And maybe that's also a puzzle for you to sort out; how can you rebracket this thing to get different, different sums out? Well, there's really amazing things to be discovered yet, um, the first one is basically saying, and you can actually, with what I showed you today, you can actually figure out the details yourself. *deep breath* is that if I give you an arbitrary infinite series, there's three different cases; so you can ask, in how many different sums can I rearrange this thing? So the first case is, no matter how I rearrange this thing, I'll never get a sum. The second case is it rearranges in all possible...sums. And the third case is, it just is one sum, no matter how you rearrange it. Now this gets even freakier when you are considering infinite series of complex numbers, or infinite series of vectors, and you can do this in Banach spaces, and you can do this in all kinds of other things, but maybe, maybe that's um, *exhales* maybe that's enough for today.

That's...0.5 in this case, and then, third partial sum, fourth partial sum, and so you get this sequence of numbers here, and in the case of this series, the sequence of numbers 'converges' to a certain number. which is ln(2). And then we say that this series has sum, that number, ln(2) in this case. That's the definition of a sum of an infinite series. This is an example of a 'convergent' series. A series that actually has a sum which is a finite number. Ah, now there's also lots of series that don't converge. And they are called 'divergent'. So for example, if we replace all the minuses in here by pluses, I already showed in that other video up there, that this adds up to +∞. But there's other types of divergence, For example, if we take this guy there, that's 1 - 1 + 1 - 1+... ; the partial sums here are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 They don't settle down to anything; not finite, not infinite, that's also divergent. So there are different sorts of divergent. To explain what's going on here, let's have a look at the positive terms, and the negative terms separately. So if you just add up all the positive terms, you'll actually find you get ∞. And if you actually add up the negative terms, you get -∞. And, actually if you've watched the other video you should be able to prove that yourself, and maybe do it in the comments. So what we're really doing here is we're subtracting ∞ from ∞ in a controlled manner. What Riemann's rearrangement theorem says is that if you've got a convergent series, whose positive terms add up to ∞, and whose negative terms add up to -∞, then you can rearrange the series into series that have any sum you want. So let me demonstrate this now for π, with this particular series. Okay, so we want pi. [CAPTIONER'S NOTE: Don't we all, Mathologer :)] That's positive, so we're going to start with some positive terms. So the first term of my new series is going to be 1. So the first partial sum is also going to be 1. The partial sums, I put up there. Now, that is not enough, so we add a few more of those positive terms, let's get close to π. Now we actually have to add quite a few of them to get close to π, we are still just under here, so let's add one more, and that gets us just over. This string of terms, we choose as the beginning bit of our new series. So we're just over, now we're going to use some negative terms to get just under. Okay, so we use the, actually, the -1/2 is good enough, so, that gets us under. *thoughtful pause* 2.6 and so on. *dramatic pause* Alright, now let's go over again, so for that,  we'll just use some positive terms. Um, we actually need quite a few again, but we can be absolutely sure that we can get over because, at any stage of this process, the positive terms that are left over will add up to ∞, and the negative terms that are left over will add up to ∞, so I can always be sure that no matter how far I'm under, or how far I'm over, I can always take enough terms to get under or over. Alright, now we can just keep on going like this, so then a negative term to get us under again, then a positive, positive terms again to get us over, and we go, flip back and forth, and eventually we get to π. And we can also be sure that we get to π because the terms themselves, they get smaller and smaller in magnitude, so that means that as I overshoot and undershoot, I get closer and closer to π. And actually,  uh, I can rearrange this initial series in infinitely many ways, different ways, to get me π; I can also rearrange it to get me an infinite sum, all sorts of other things, so maybe you'll also want to do this in the comments, figure out the details there. Now, for other series, you can actually have the situation where nothing changes no matter what you do. So there's lots of convergent series where the positive terms add up to a positive number and the negative terms add up to a negative number, so for example, it could be, you know, 2, the positive terms, and minus 7, the negative terms. And then, no matter how you reshuffle,  this series, the sum will always be 2 - 7 is -5. Okay, now there's something else that we're actually doing here, we're actually bracketing, alright, so we're bracketing. So we can bracket like this, we can bracket like that, or maybe we don't do any brackets whatsoever, And actually, as long as we're dealing with, infinite series, that converge, either this type or of that type, doesn't matter what, you can put in brackets wherever you want, and the sum won't change. So I mean, that's a bit reassuring *chuckles anxiously* so, basically commutativity is broken, but but, uh, associativity, at least for convergent series, doesn't get mucked up, so it's quite nice. *excited* BUT, there's at least one more surprise happening here; that's just for convergent series. So if you actually look at some divergent series, strange things can happen even when you bracket them. So for example, this guy here, the 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 divergent series, if you just bracket it right, you'll actually get a convergent series. with a certain sum, and actually you can bracket this in many, many different ways, and get different sums out. And maybe that's also a puzzle for you to sort out; how can you rebracket this thing to get different, different sums out? Well, there's really amazing things to be discovered yet, um, the first one is basically saying, and you can actually, with what I showed you today, you can actually figure out the details yourself. *deep breath* is that if I give you an arbitrary infinite series, there's three different cases; so you can ask, in how many different sums can I rearrange this thing? So the first case is, no matter how I rearrange this thing, I'll never get a sum. The second case is it rearranges in all possible...sums. And the third case is, it just is one sum, no matter how you rearrange it. Now this gets even freakier when you are considering infinite series of complex numbers, or infinite series of vectors, and you can do this in Banach spaces, and you can do this in all kinds of other things, but maybe, maybe that's um, *exhales* maybe that's enough for today.

**Transcript**:
Modern fashion trends can be... weird. I mean, skinny jeans can get a little uncomfortable,
yes. And maybe you have a friend who spends more
time waxing his mustache and trimming his beard than he does actually bathing himself. But your fashion choices probably won’t
kill, burn, or poison you. However, people haven't always been so lucky. Historically, some pretty dangerous clothing,
cosmetics, and accessories have come in vogue, endangering their wearers and makers alike. It turns out there are just some things that
you really don’t want to put on or in your body… even if everyone else is doing it. [INTRO] Let’s start in the 1700s, when skirts were
huge, cool guys wore wigs, and the hottest color in Europe was green. Specifically, two special pigments known as
Scheele’s Green and Emerald Green. In 1775, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele
developed copper arsenate, an intense, yellow-green pigment that was more brilliant and longer-lasting
than any other green dye. It was also a lot more toxic because it was
made with arsenic. German scientists soon improved on Scheele’s
recipe by inventing an even more vivid green dye -- copper acetoarsenite, commonly known
as Emerald Green or Paris Green. And society loved it. They used it to decorate everything from fake
plants to ball gowns. For fashionistas, the danger emerged when
they’d sweat through their green gloves, stockings, or socks, and transfer the toxins
to their skin. This caused chemical burns and open sores
that absorbed even more of the poison. A poisonous dust would also flake off of dyed
objects, especially wallpapers or twirling dresses as people danced at balls. If you breathed in enough arsenic, the poisoning
could cause vomiting, ulcers, nerve damage, and eventually even death. But arsenic pigments weren’t the only harmful
ones. Some of the first synthetic dyes for clothes
and shoes could cause some pretty nasty health problems all on their own. Aniline is a toxic organic compound that was
first isolated from the indigo plant in the 1820s. When ingested, it interferes with blood cells’
ability to carry oxygen. But in 1856, a chemistry student named William
Henry Perkin was trying to use aniline to create an antimalarial drug, when he accidentally
created mauveine, a bright purple dye. And soon, aniline dyes were all the rage. Their vibrant reds and deep blacks made natural
dyes look muted by comparison. But I bet you can guess what happened next. People who wore socks, gloves, and shirts
colored with aniline, or shoes that had been shined with an aniline-based polish, often
suffered inflammatory skin reactions or headaches and dizziness… because the dye was poisoning
their blood. Our next dangerous trend is more like a single
horrible incident. The culprit in this case was zinc chloride,
which wasn’t used to dye fabrics, but it was used in a coating that goes on wool to
protect the fabric. The compound had, and still has, lots of applications,
because it’s both highly corrosive and highly soluble in water. But, one day, in December 1898, over 60 men
were hired to clean the streets of Birmingham, England after a snowstorm. And they were all given new wool overcoats
to keep them warm. Nice, right? Well, most of the men ended up in the hospital,
with large patches of destroyed skin around their knees and wrists. It turns out, their coats had been treated
with an excess of zinc chloride, and when they got wet from the snow, the toxin dripped
onto their skin and caused serious chemical burns. Now, we’ve talked before about how asbestos
has been misused over the ages. But before anyone knew that asbestos equals
dying, it was often worn for protection. It can form lightweight fibers that can be
woven into fabric, and it's famously flame retardant. So, from ancient Rome until at least the early
1980s, lots of dangerous, fire-related jobs involved wearing uniforms with some amount
of asbestos in them. This was especially true for firefighters. But, asbestos fibers are incredibly dangerous
for human health. Even when they’re woven into clothing, asbestos
fibers can break off into tiny pieces that can enter the lungs. When too many fibers build up in your lungs,
they cause irritation, inflammation, and scarring, hindering the ability to absorb oxygen and
making it hard to breathe. Asbestos is also a carcinogen. People who are exposed to large amounts of
it tend to develop an otherwise-rare lung cancer called mesothelioma. So even though we were using it as protection,
asbestos was doing tremendous damage to our bodies all along. Another fabric that proved to be more harmful
than we expected is viscose rayon. In the late 1800s, chemists were looking for
an artificial substitute for natural silk, which, as sexy as it is, is incredibly time-consuming
and expensive to produce. In 1905, a British company began making a
new material: They started with a sticky solution of dissolved wood pulp, which contains lots
of the natural plant polymer cellulose. They aged it, dumped in some chemicals, and
eventually extracted fibers that looked and felt a lot like silk. We know those fibers today as rayon. One of the key steps in making viscose rayon
involved a compound called carbon disulfide, which is -- as you might guess-- highly toxic! The fabric was safe to wear, but factory workers
suffered. Prolonged exposure to carbon disulfide can
damage the cardiovascular and nervous systems. This was linked to behavioral and health problems
among workers ranging from bouts of mania to strokes. But even with these hazards, the popularity
of artificial silk kept booming, well into the 1900s. So you might know the Mad Hatter from Lewis
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland -- kind of crazy, drinks a lot of tea? Turns out, he might have some basis in reality. The phrase “mad as a hatter” was actually
used to describe industrial hat-makers in the mid-1800s, who were poisoned by mercury
just by doing their jobs. Most hats were felted, or made from the fur
of small animals. And to make felt, hatters used a process called
“carroting,” where they washed the pelts in an orange solution containing mercury nitrate
to separate the fur from the skin and shrink it into a thin mat. But the price they paid for dapper hats was
mercury poisoning, which drastically harmed hatters’ central nervous systems. Mercurial disease, or Mad Hatter Disease,
causes extreme emotional states plus physical effects, like tremors and difficulty walking,
speaking, and writing. Since these hats didn’t poison the general
public, the occupational hazards of being a hatter persisted. It took half a century or longer for countries
to start banning the use of mercury in the felt hat industry. But what about cosmetics? One fashion trend that emerged in the 1500s
was an obsession with blindingly white skin. In 16th and 17th-century England, women painted
their faces with a whitening paste called Venetian ceruse. The pigment was made by mixing metallic lead
with acetic acid -- also known as vinegar -- in the presence of carbon dioxide to make
lead carbonate, a powdery white lead. This gave the illusion of a snow-white face,
but over time, it would eat away at people’s skin and caused scarring, headaches, nausea,
muscle damage, baldness, and eventually early death. In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie famously discovered
radium, in the form of radium chloride, by extracting it from the radioactive mineral
called uraninite, or pitchblende. After a couple decades of work, in 1910, they
were able to isolate radium as a pure metal. And this discovery not only thrilled scientific
researchers, but it also caused a wave of “science-based” consumer goods to sweep
the world. We are talking... radium makeup! For example, the London-based Radior in 1917
used radium in products like face creams, soaps, powders, and blush. In the 1930s, ladies in Paris could wear Tho-Radia
brand cosmetics, made from both thorium chloride and radium bromide -- apparently, the more
radioactive elements, the better. Thankfully, most of these products contained
such low amounts of radium that they were pretty much harmless -- although it’s possible
that customers suffered health effects later in life. Instead, the most serious poisoning cases
were in the factories where radium products were made. Especially in the “Radium Girls,” a group
of about 4,000 factory workers in the United States who painted watch faces with glowing
paint and were pretty much bathed in radioactive dust every day. By the 1920s, they began to suffer from anemia,
“radium jaw” and bone cancers. Within about 20 years, largely because of
their plight, radium-branded products had all but disappeared from the market. And people weren’t just putting toxins on
their face for the sake of beauty. They also put poison in their eyes to look
more attractive. The poison in question here is atropine, a
compound derived from a poisonous plant called Deadly Nightshade, or Atropa belladonna. “Belladonna” means “beautiful lady”
in Italian, and it stems from a dangerous beauty practice. In some ancient cultures, women were said
to put drops of juice from Deadly Nightshade berries in their eyes to dilate, or enlarge,
their pupils for that striking doe-eyed look. Atropine is a smooth muscle relaxant, and
your irises are full of smooth muscles that expand and contract to let in different amounts
of light. By adding atropine to your eye, you’re stopping
your iris from being able to respond to light. Putting lots of atropine in your eyes is a
pretty horrible idea, because constantly dilated eyes can expose your retinas to too much light,
damaging the sensory tissues and affecting your vision. Plus, forcing your eye muscles into unnatural
positions has been found to affect your internal eye pressure and damage your optic nerve,
which could lead to blindness. Today, doctors still use atropine for its
muscle relaxing and anesthetic effects, mainly to dilate your pupils before eye exams. They just use it in very small, controlled
doses. Finally, let’s go out with a bang with combustible
fashion accessories! Celluloid was the most successful early, synthetic
plastic. It was cheap, light, strong, easily molded
to whatever shape you wanted. So in the late 1800s and early 1900s, celluloid
accessories were everywhere -- buttons, jewelry, eyeglass frames, toys, and little hair combs
that ladies would wear. But, what people didn’t realize was that
celluloid was manufactured using a compound called cellulose nitrate. Now, cellulose is that naturally-occurring
plant polymer I mentioned earlier. And when you expose cellulose, like in wood
pulp or cotton, to nitric acid, it forms cellulose nitrate -- which is highly flammable. So flammable that it’s also called guncotton
because of its tendency to … explode. So with the rise in popularity of celluloid
accessories came a wave of newspaper articles about combs combusting in people’s hair,
setting their whole body on fire, just from the heat from a curling iron or a nearby electric
lamp. There were even reports of entire stores burning
down because they stored their celluloid stuff too close to windows and mirrors on hot summer
days. So, in comparison, those skinny jeans and
mustache waxes don’t seem so bad now, do they? All told, it’s much safer to commit a fashion
faux-pas than have your skin burned or your hair catch on fire, all because of a trend. Thanks for watching this SciShow List Show,

were in the factories where radium products were made. Especially in the “Radium Girls,” a group
of about 4,000 factory workers in the United States who painted watch faces with glowing
paint and were pretty much bathed in radioactive dust every day. By the 1920s, they began to suffer from anemia,
“radium jaw” and bone cancers. Within about 20 years, largely because of
their plight, radium-branded products had all but disappeared from the market. And people weren’t just putting toxins on
their face for the sake of beauty. They also put poison in their eyes to look
more attractive. The poison in question here is atropine, a
compound derived from a poisonous plant called Deadly Nightshade, or Atropa belladonna. “Belladonna” means “beautiful lady”
in Italian, and it stems from a dangerous beauty practice. In some ancient cultures, women were said
to put drops of juice from Deadly Nightshade berries in their eyes to dilate, or enlarge,
their pupils for that striking doe-eyed look. Atropine is a smooth muscle relaxant, and
your irises are full of smooth muscles that expand and contract to let in different amounts
of light. By adding atropine to your eye, you’re stopping
your iris from being able to respond to light. Putting lots of atropine in your eyes is a
pretty horrible idea, because constantly dilated eyes can expose your retinas to too much light,
damaging the sensory tissues and affecting your vision. Plus, forcing your eye muscles into unnatural
positions has been found to affect your internal eye pressure and damage your optic nerve,
which could lead to blindness. Today, doctors still use atropine for its
muscle relaxing and anesthetic effects, mainly to dilate your pupils before eye exams. They just use it in very small, controlled
doses. Finally, let’s go out with a bang with combustible
fashion accessories! Celluloid was the most successful early, synthetic
plastic. It was cheap, light, strong, easily molded
to whatever shape you wanted. So in the late 1800s and early 1900s, celluloid
accessories were everywhere -- buttons, jewelry, eyeglass frames, toys, and little hair combs
that ladies would wear. But, what people didn’t realize was that
celluloid was manufactured using a compound called cellulose nitrate. Now, cellulose is that naturally-occurring
plant polymer I mentioned earlier. And when you expose cellulose, like in wood
pulp or cotton, to nitric acid, it forms cellulose nitrate -- which is highly flammable. So flammable that it’s also called guncotton
because of its tendency to … explode. So with the rise in popularity of celluloid
accessories came a wave of newspaper articles about combs combusting in people’s hair,
setting their whole body on fire, just from the heat from a curling iron or a nearby electric
lamp. There were even reports of entire stores burning
down because they stored their celluloid stuff too close to windows and mirrors on hot summer
days. So, in comparison, those skinny jeans and
mustache waxes don’t seem so bad now, do they? All told, it’s much safer to commit a fashion
faux-pas than have your skin burned or your hair catch on fire, all because of a trend. Thanks for watching this SciShow List Show,

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds

**Transcript**:
- Hello there, my name's Gavin, and welcome to this
episode of The Slow Mo Guys very oddly presented from my living room. A while ago, I made a video called "How a Camera Works In Slow Mo", and the response was great. So I thought a good natural
progression to that video would be how a TV works in slow mo. This is an 85-inch LCD TV, and whenever I'm playing something on it or watching something on it, my eyes and brain are
being misled and tricked, giving me the illusion of
watching a moving object when in fact I'm just
watching several still images just shown to me very, very fast. If I'm watching a film, I'm being shown 24 images
every second, and to my eyes, that looks like I'm
looking at a moving object when in fact I'm looking
at 24 individual pictures. If I'm playing a game, it's the same, except maybe 30 to 60 frames a second, and if I'm on a PC, it could be 100s, PC master race. But a TV like this is actually incapable of showing you one image and
then 1/24 of a second later just switching all at
once to the next image, and to illustrate this next point, I'm gonna use a very old
and very crap CRT TV. That stands for cathode ray tube. If you've ever seen one of these filmed, you may notice that it looks
slightly different on camera than it does to your eye. Look at that. The reason it looks like this is because the shutter speed
of this camera is out of sync with the refresh rate of this screen. The frame is constructed
from the top to the bottom multiple times per second; that's 60 times in the US, 60 Hertz. I've prepared for you
some high speed footage that I shot a long time ago on the v2511 of this screen and this
screen and some others. A lot of it is Dan paying "Super Mario" on the NES extremely badly. Here's the TV and the
cat played back at 25; this is how it would be
perceived in real time. And now at 1600 frames a second, you can actually see the scan line moving from the top to the bottom, and you'll notice that on a CRT screen, it's only the active line
of pixels that's bright, and your persistence of vision will actually build that
into a complete image. It's messing with my eyes, this. - It's like a dance floor. Oh, I didn't even make
it past the first guy. - Slowed all the way down
to 2500 frames a second, you can now differentiate
each individual frame being built from top to bottom. It takes an extremely fast camera to see that each frame
is built line by line from top to bottom, but it
takes an even faster camera to see that each line is
drawn from left to right. Slowed down to 28,500 frames a second, we're now seeing glimpses of that, but we do need to go even slower. This is now 118,000 frames a second, and I'm gonna put the
stats up for you here so you can see the actual
amount of time that it took, and you can see now that
the line is being drawn from left to right on the screen. Now at 146,000 frames a second, to gain perspective on just
how slow this actually is, you can see the exact time I shot this. So this is hours, it
was just past midnight, 23 minutes, 41 seconds,
this is 1/10 of a second, 1/100 of a second, 1/1000 of
a second or a millisecond, and then over here you've
got 1/10,000 of a second, 1/100,000 of a second, and this unit here is the millionth of a
second, or a microsecond. We are now at 380,000 frames a second as our recording frame rate. That is the highest frame
rate we've ever shot so far on this channel,
and using this information, here's a little bonus fact: a CRT screen can draw Mario's mustache in less than 1/380,000 of a second. That is some seriously fast facial hair. And if you're wondering why this footage looks extremely mucky and blurry, it's because the resolution
is only 256 by 128, which, plonked into a
4K frame, is this big. That CRT screen is standard def; this is a 4K screen, which
means it's 3840 by 2160 pixels. That's over eight million pixels. So think of the processing
power that this TV has to have to update an image that big
that many times every second. The first thing you'll notice
about a modern LCD screen is that it's not only
the active line of pixels that retains brightness;
it's the entire image. So you can actually see the full image as each scan-line passes down the screen. This is every frame of the
start-up sequence on an Xbox One. I also recorded myself
playing a game of "Halo". Nothing will make you feel
worse about your performance than watching your lousy aim
in slow mo, look at that. It's crazy to think that
when you're playing "Halo", this is actually what
is happening on your TV. If only you could see at this speed, your aim would be incredible. It honestly makes me feel bad when I fall asleep watching TV, knowing that this TV is
doing all this intensive work changing literally 10s of
millions of pixels every second, and there's no one there watching it. Here's a fun fact: the
same applies to an iPhone, except it's in portrait mode. So if you're watching a video in landscape mode on your iPhone, you're actually getting
updates from left to right, or right to left, depending on
which way you've flipped it, and that just proved to me that you can't see the refresh direction with your naked eye,
because I had no idea, whenever I was watching a
YouTube video on my iPhone, that the screen was updating in a completely different direction. I'm not sure if this is the
case for all smartphones, but it's certainly the
case on an iPhone 7 Plus, which is what I filmed this on. So we've talked about one illusion of TVs, the illusion of movement. The second illusion I wanna talk about is the illusion of color. For this next part, I'm
gonna need a second camera. Here's one, that's you, hello, you. So in order to film this
screen extremely close, I'm gonna have to set my focus to the minimum possible distance, so it's sort of like right here now. Set to my minimum focus, as I slowly move towards the screen, it becomes sharper, and you will then, at the last minute, see a very odd looking pattern. And what you're seeing there is an effect caused by the camera, this camera, trying to resolve individual pixels on the surface of this screen. As I push further forward,
the effect disappears, and everything goes out of focus. That's because I'm now beyond
the minimum focal distance of this lens, which is about,
well, that's about there. Not close enough. In order to get closer, I'm
gonna need a macro lens. Here's one. As I approach the white, and everything starts to become in focus, you can see that white
isn't so white anymore. It looks like I have to
go closer even than that. Thankfully, I can go all the way to five times magnification. Now, one thing from this point, I am definitely gonna need a tripod, because there's no way my arms are sturdy enough to hold this in place, but I'll just ease it in just to show you the level of magnification
we're talking about now. Well, this close, it's a
different story altogether. I'm gonna get a tripod. Here's one. What a mission this is, all right, let's see what we can do here. We're so close up right now that I can actually disturb this image by blowing on the lens. We're now looking at the sub-pixel level. A pixel is made up of three sub-pixels, red, green, and blue, RGB, you
may have heard that before, and this creates the
illusion of different colors. By dimming and brightening
different sub-pixels to different intensities,
this screen can create the illusion of literally
millions of different colors. When all three are lit to full
brightness, you get white. When all three dim, you go through gray all the way down to black. So if green dims away, and
red and blue are still lit, then you go into magenta,
purple, that sort of area, and that's how the colors are made. So every time on your TV you're
looking at a white image, you're looking at tons of
blue, green, and red lights. They're just so small they
look like white to your eye. Before you get white;
red, green, and blue blurs into yellow, cyan, and magenta, and that's what happens here when I move the screen
slightly out of focus. This is too close to watch
a Slow Mo Guys video. I might vomit. It's the same situation, just entire blocks and they're bigger. As I mentioned before,
this is a 4K LCD screen, which, a while back, were typically lit by CCFLs, or a cold
cathode fluorescent lamp, which means the entire panel is backlit by fluorescent tubes. Nowadays, they are backlit by LEDs. This is why this would actually
be marketed as an LED TV. The benefit of LED
screens over CCFL screens is that they're a lot thinner. Now I'm gonna point it at
where some black text is. Now, interestingly, even
though this area is black because all the sub-pixels have dimmed, they are still in fact backlit. Let me show you that right now. Now you can see, as we push in here, you have to pardon the noise, we're at an extremely high ISO to get this shot through a macro lens, but you can see even the dimmed pixels, part of the liquid crystal display as it's now trying to block all light from penetrating through, but
it's still a backlit pixel, and that's one of the
fundamental limitations of an LCD screen. You can see this effect on an LCD screen in the credits of a film, 'cause you've got an almost
completely black image, but because there's white text, the entire backlight has to
be on to display the white, which means light will leak
out from the black pixels, which means it's not true black. There is another technology that's becoming much
more common these days, and that is an OLED screen,
organic light-emitting diode. I did wanna include a comparison between an LCD panel and an OLED panel, but I didn't actually have an OLED TV, and by sheer luck, right in the middle of me shooting all this footage, LG got in touch and offered
to supply me with an OLED TV for the purpose of making this video, which I really appreciate. Thanks, LG. Why don't we go and take a look at it. This is a 77-inch LG OLED TV. The way OLED technology works is that each pixel is self-illuminating, depending on how much voltage
is passing through it, which means there's no
global backlight on the TV. Each pixel is individually in
control of how bright it is, and it's not being lit from behind. And that means, when we go
to our high ISO experiment, just like we did on the LCD, that when there's an area
of black on the screen, all of those pixels are off, and you can see here where
I'm putting my cursor in front of the lens, you can see each sub-pixel lighting up and then completely turning
off when it goes away. This technology means much deeper blacks, and the possibility of a very thin screen. And there you have it: a brief explanation of how a TV works in slow mo. If you found that video interesting, chances are you might find
some other videos interesting on this channel, so make sure you boop, and once you've booped,
feel free to check out our it's just there. Thank you very much for watching. That was good timing, weren't it? TV timed out, and now there's fireworks.

**Transcript**:
- Hello there, my name's Gavin, and welcome to this
episode of The Slow Mo Guys very oddly presented from my living room. A while ago, I made a video called "How a Camera Works In Slow Mo", and the response was great. So I thought a good natural
progression to that video would be how a TV works in slow mo. This is an 85-inch LCD TV, and whenever I'm playing something on it or watching something on it, my eyes and brain are
being misled and tricked, giving me the illusion of
watching a moving object when in fact I'm just
watching several still images just shown to me very, very fast. If I'm watching a film, I'm being shown 24 images
every second, and to my eyes, that looks like I'm
looking at a moving object when in fact I'm looking
at 24 individual pictures. If I'm playing a game, it's the same, except maybe 30 to 60 frames a second, and if I'm on a PC, it could be 100s, PC master race. But a TV like this is actually incapable of showing you one image and
then 1/24 of a second later just switching all at
once to the next image, and to illustrate this next point, I'm gonna use a very old
and very crap CRT TV. That stands for cathode ray tube. If you've ever seen one of these filmed, you may notice that it looks
slightly different on camera than it does to your eye. Look at that. The reason it looks like this is because the shutter speed
of this camera is out of sync with the refresh rate of this screen. The frame is constructed
from the top to the bottom multiple times per second; that's 60 times in the US, 60 Hertz. I've prepared for you
some high speed footage that I shot a long time ago on the v2511 of this screen and this
screen and some others. A lot of it is Dan paying "Super Mario" on the NES extremely badly. Here's the TV and the
cat played back at 25; this is how it would be
perceived in real time. And now at 1600 frames a second, you can actually see the scan line moving from the top to the bottom, and you'll notice that on a CRT screen, it's only the active line
of pixels that's bright, and your persistence of vision will actually build that
into a complete image. It's messing with my eyes, this. - It's like a dance floor. Oh, I didn't even make
it past the first guy. - Slowed all the way down
to 2500 frames a second, you can now differentiate
each individual frame being built from top to bottom. It takes an extremely fast camera to see that each frame
is built line by line from top to bottom, but it
takes an even faster camera to see that each line is
drawn from left to right. Slowed down to 28,500 frames a second, we're now seeing glimpses of that, but we do need to go even slower. This is now 118,000 frames a second, and I'm gonna put the
stats up for you here so you can see the actual
amount of time that it took, and you can see now that
the line is being drawn from left to right on the screen. Now at 146,000 frames a second, to gain perspective on just
how slow this actually is, you can see the exact time I shot this. So this is hours, it
was just past midnight, 23 minutes, 41 seconds,
this is 1/10 of a second, 1/100 of a second, 1/1000 of
a second or a millisecond, and then over here you've
got 1/10,000 of a second, 1/100,000 of a second, and this unit here is the millionth of a
second, or a microsecond. We are now at 380,000 frames a second as our recording frame rate. That is the highest frame
rate we've ever shot so far on this channel,
and using this information, here's a little bonus fact: a CRT screen can draw Mario's mustache in less than 1/380,000 of a second. That is some seriously fast facial hair. And if you're wondering why this footage looks extremely mucky and blurry, it's because the resolution

**Transcript**:
Well, we all need a reason to wake up. For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I
were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead. Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet,
and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! (Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death -- and it also began
my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share
of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents for a system that too often
does not serve. Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity
for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled
and concentrated. There are no do-overs. My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking
into this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow. It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens. Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday -- suffering together. Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand, so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed
something we can affect. Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction between necessary
and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three
design cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care, is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something
of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in
the next moment. Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could. It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind
so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective. After my accident,
when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family,
nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body
with flower petals. It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image
to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience
in the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit room
lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop
even when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in,
the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person
had never really existed. Well-intended, of course,
in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for
within those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally
the opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do;
I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma
and treatable illness. They are no place to live and die;
that's not what they were designed for. Now mind you -- I am not
giving up on the notion that our institutions
can become more humane. Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital
in Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really
great care at every turn, including good
palliative care for my pain. And one night, it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses
complaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it
coming down all sticky. Next day, one of my nurses
smuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping
onto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt
and turn into water. In that moment, just being any part of this planet
in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packed
all the inspiration I needed to both try to live
and be OK if I did not. In a hospital, that's a stolen moment. In my work over the years,
I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die. Not because they had found
some final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed
by what their lives had become -- in a word, cut off, or ugly. There are already record numbers of us
living with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age. And we are nowhere near ready
or prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructure
dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. Now is the time to create
something new, something vital. I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar. We have tons of input
for designers of all stripes to work with. We know, for example, from research what's most important to people
who are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened
and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense
of wonderment and spirituality. Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more
from our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette. She finds it harder to breathe
one day to the next due to ALS. Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again -- and French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled
while she has them. Priorities change. Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying
at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy
coursing through her veins -- she's done that. Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,
where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down to
loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the very thing
doing the living and the dying. Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house
is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents
can eat very little, if anything at all. But we realize we are providing
sustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane. Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff
happening under our roof, one of the most tried and true
interventions we know of, is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least
the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people
living and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that say
the things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present -- no need for a past or a future. So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out
of the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity
by way of the senses, by way of the body --
the aesthetic realm -- is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the third
and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights,
to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life
more wonderful, rather than just less horrible. Beneficence. Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient-
or human-centered model of care, and here is where caring
becomes a creative, generative, even playful act. "Play" may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of our
highest forms of adaptation. Consider every major compulsory effort
it takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine. The need for shelter
has given rise to architecture. The need for cover, fashion. And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. So, since dying
is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By "play" I am in no way suggesting
we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate
any particular way of dying. There are mountains of sorrow
that cannot move, and one way or another,
we will all kneel there. Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life
to play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just
getting out of the way, aging and dying can become
a process of crescendo through to the end. We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this. (Laughter) Meanwhile, we can -- (Laughter) We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say
one way or another. I got to redesign my life
around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find
a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting
for a perfect moment, all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it. Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Well, we all need a reason to wake up. For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I
were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead. Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet,
and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! (Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death -- and it also began
my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share
of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents for a system that too often
does not serve. Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity
for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled
and concentrated. There are no do-overs. My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking
into this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow. It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens. Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday -- suffering together. Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand, so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed
something we can affect. Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction between necessary
and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three
design cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care, is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something
of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in
the next moment. Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could. It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind
so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective. After my accident,
when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family,
nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body

**Transcript**:
After a massive storm tears 
through the Hex Archipelago, you find five grizzled 
survivors in the water. Shivering their timbers, they explain that they’re the former crew 
of the great pirate Greenbeard, who marooned them 
after they tried to mutiny. Each was bound up in a different 
spot on a small island, until the storm washed them out to sea. In gratitude for saving them, 
they reveal a secret: the island they were on is also where 
Greenbeard has buried his treasure hoard. But when the sailors try to describe 
the island, something seems off. All agree it was flat and barren with no 
prominent features except for some trees. Yet each pirate claims they saw 
a different number of trees, ranging from two to six. The pirate who saw two trees says the
treasure was buried right at his feet. When you fly your hot air balloon 
over the area to investigate, you see hundreds of small islands,
each with exactly six trees. The next storm will be here soon, so you’ll have to hurry 
and narrow your search. What does the island with Greenbeard’s
treasure look like from the sky? And where will the treasure be 
on that island? Pause here if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It might seem like the pirates 
are delirious from dehydration. But that’s not what’s going on. Remember, each was confined 
to a separate point on the island, and no two of them could see 
the same number of trees. That means that for all but one pirate, 
something was blocking their view. And since there are no other 
features on the island, that something could only 
have been other trees. A pirate would see fewer trees 
when two or more fell along a straight line 
from their vantage point. So we need to find the island where five different pirates standing 
in different spots would each see a
different number of trees. Virtually every island has a position 
from which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a
position where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations
to find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees
to line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees 
were lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end 
of the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from 
which you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel
and they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position 
where the two lines converge from which you could 
see exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which 
you could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only 
one island in the archipelago with two non-parallel lines of trees, and it’ll be buried at the intersection 
of the two lines. You land on this island and dig up a chest
containing a massive pile of tree seeds, ready for planting. Was this treasure really worth 
all that trouble? That’s a matter of perspective.

**Transcript**:
After a massive storm tears 
through the Hex Archipelago, you find five grizzled 
survivors in the water. Shivering their timbers, they explain that they’re the former crew 
of the great pirate Greenbeard, who marooned them 
after they tried to mutiny. Each was bound up in a different 
spot on a small island, until the storm washed them out to sea. In gratitude for saving them, 
they reveal a secret: the island they were on is also where 
Greenbeard has buried his treasure hoard. But when the sailors try to describe 
the island, something seems off. All agree it was flat and barren with no 
prominent features except for some trees. Yet each pirate claims they saw 
a different number of trees, ranging from two to six. The pirate who saw two trees says the
treasure was buried right at his feet. When you fly your hot air balloon 
over the area to investigate, you see hundreds of small islands,
each with exactly six trees. The next storm will be here soon, so you’ll have to hurry 
and narrow your search. What does the island with Greenbeard’s
treasure look like from the sky? And where will the treasure be 
on that island? Pause here if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It might seem like the pirates 
are delirious from dehydration. But that’s not what’s going on. Remember, each was confined 
to a separate point on the island, and no two of them could see 
the same number of trees. That means that for all but one pirate, 
something was blocking their view. And since there are no other 
features on the island, that something could only 
have been other trees. A pirate would see fewer trees 
when two or more fell along a straight line 
from their vantage point. So we need to find the island where five different pirates standing 
in different spots would each see a
different number of trees. Virtually every island has a position 
from which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a
position where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations
to find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees
to line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees 
were lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end 
of the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from 
which you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel
and they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position 
where the two lines converge from which you could 
see exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which 
you could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only 
one island in the archipelago with two non-parallel lines of trees, and it’ll be buried at the intersection 
of the two lines. You land on this island and dig up a chest
containing a massive pile of tree seeds, ready for planting. Was this treasure really worth 
all that trouble? That’s a matter of perspective.

**Transcript**:
In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll

**Transcript**:
In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Male lions and bears will often cannibalize ______.
Options: A. Cubs sired by another male, B. Other males who are competing with them, C. Older adults in times of food shortage, D. Their own cubs if they refuse to pick up after themselves
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is a common reason why male animals, such as lions and bears, kill and eat the offspring of other males?
Options: A. To reduce competition for food among the offspring., B. To cull the weak and bolster the strong among the offspring., C. To bring the female into heat more quickly, allowing them to mate and produce their own offspring., D. To protect their territory from other males.
Correct Option: C

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is closely related to the ground truth question, but it focuses on the reason behind the behavior rather than the behavior itself.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 1.0000 (The correct answer in the generated question matches the ground truth answer, as both indicate that male lions and bears cannibalize cubs sired by another male to bring the female into heat more quickly.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.8000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible but could be improved. Options A and B are related to the benefits of cannibalism, but they are not directly relevant to the specific behavior of male lions and bears.

**Transcript**:
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true? How much of yourself can you remove, before you stop being you? And does the question even make sense? Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there are stars in the milky way. A cell is a living being, a machine make of up to 50,000 different proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose; it just is. But it is still an individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the enviroment, and so on. If you extract cells from your body, and put them in the right enviroment, they will continue to stay alive for a while. So, your cells can exist without you, but you can't exist without them. If we take all the cells away, there is no 'you' anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person? Or is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine an experiment: you and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time, your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells. At which point would they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you? Let's make this more complicated! The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable. Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven year period most of your cells are replaced at least once. Everytime you cells set up changes, you are slightly different than before. So, a part of you is dying contantly. If you are lucky enough to become old, you would have cycled through roughly a million billion cells. So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes, cells are broken and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer is not an outside invader; it's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours. But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes an other entity inside us - another being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell story, is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually, cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still alive, and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So, there are living parts around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you, anyway? Maybe the information contained in it: your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than one thousand mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria, that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things, made from more little things, that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So, we might just be a self-sustaining pattern, without clear borders, that gained self awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question about ourselves, but it is also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us - while still in the skull... Click here to go to my channel, and watch the next part.

Here's a strange thing wolves and coyotes
have these big upright ears. All the better to hear you with. But my dog Zeke here has floppy ears. Why the difference? Doesn't he need to hear too? Charles Darwin himself actually thought a
lot about this question. 150 years ago, he published a book that said,
"Look—it's not just pet dogs!” Pigs have floppier ears than wild boars. Farmed goats have floppier ears than wild
goats. There are floppy-eared rabbits, cows and sheep. And that's not the only weird thing! Tame animals tend to have shorter snouts,
and their fur tends to be paler or have patches with color missing. All these mysterious traits put together have
been called "domestication syndrome." So, what's going on here? The story starts thousands and thousands of years ago when humans were surrounded by animals. Some animals were scary, and some were a bit more approachable even potentially useful. Our ancestors wanted them to be tamer, so sometimes they tried breeding the friendliest ones. At some point, strange side effects started to show up Thousands of years later, good old Darwin
noticed the domestication syndrome pattern, but all he'd learned about change in the animal kingdom couldn't explain this connection between
behavior and appearance. Scientists who came after him
couldn't figure it out either. But for the past few years, scientists have
been throwing around a fascinating hypothesis. They think the answer to this whole puzzle
lies in a special group of cells. They're called neural crest cells, and coincidentally, they were discovered by Wilhelm His the exact same year Darwin published his book. Neural crest cells show up very early in the
development of all vertebrate embryos. As the embryo grows into a goat or a pig or a wolf, these special cells travel to every corner of the body and take on all sorts of different jobs. Now, here's the thing: Some of these cells
end up right here above the kidneys. They become cells that secrete adrenaline —that famous fight-or-flight hormone. Wild animals are always fighting or fleeing to survive, and that makes it hard for humans to get close. But what if an animal was born with fewer
of these neural crest cells, or those cells didn't work so well? That animal would have less adrenaline. It would probably be less freaked out by humans— and it would pass that behavior on to its offspring. The idea is that this is what's going on in
domesticated animals. Their neural crest cells have been dialed back. And this would explain all the appearance
stuff, too because neural crest derived cells do a lot more than just make adrenaline. Some of the cells end up forming parts of the face. Some of them become cells that control the
color of skin and hair. And some make their way into the ears—and
help make cartilage. It's likely this is how dogs first got floppy ears. And then centuries of intentional human breeding
helped accentuate or reverse that change. But the neural crest cell hypothesis doesn't
quite explain every bit of domestication syndrome. Like—what's going on with other tame species
that do have upright ears? This be might be the excuse scientists need
to spend more time with their pets. This is Skunk Bear—NPR's science show Please subscribe and check out some papers about the neural crest cell hypothesis down in the description.

"Look—it's not just pet dogs!” Pigs have floppier ears than wild boars. Farmed goats have floppier ears than wild
goats. There are floppy-eared rabbits, cows and sheep. And that's not the only weird thing! Tame animals tend to have shorter snouts,
and their fur tends to be paler or have patches with color missing. All these mysterious traits put together have
been called "domestication syndrome." So, what's going on here? The story starts thousands and thousands of years ago when humans were surrounded by animals. Some animals were scary, and some were a bit more approachable even potentially useful. Our ancestors wanted them to be tamer, so sometimes they tried breeding the friendliest ones. At some point, strange side effects started to show up Thousands of years later, good old Darwin
noticed the domestication syndrome pattern, but all he'd learned about change in the animal kingdom couldn't explain this connection between
behavior and appearance. Scientists who came after him
couldn't figure it out either. But for the past few years, scientists have
been throwing around a fascinating hypothesis. They think the answer to this whole puzzle
lies in a special group of cells. They're called neural crest cells, and coincidentally, they were discovered by Wilhelm His the exact same year Darwin published his book. Neural crest cells show up very early in the
development of all vertebrate embryos. As the embryo grows into a goat or a pig or a wolf, these special cells travel to every corner of the body and take on all sorts of different jobs. Now, here's the thing: Some of these cells
end up right here above the kidneys. They become cells that secrete adrenaline —that famous fight-or-flight hormone. Wild animals are always fighting or fleeing to survive, and that makes it hard for humans to get close. But what if an animal was born with fewer
of these neural crest cells, or those cells didn't work so well? That animal would have less adrenaline. It would probably be less freaked out by humans— and it would pass that behavior on to its offspring. The idea is that this is what's going on in
domesticated animals. Their neural crest cells have been dialed back. And this would explain all the appearance
stuff, too because neural crest derived cells do a lot more than just make adrenaline. Some of the cells end up forming parts of the face. Some of them become cells that control the
color of skin and hair. And some make their way into the ears—and
help make cartilage. It's likely this is how dogs first got floppy ears. And then centuries of intentional human breeding
helped accentuate or reverse that change. But the neural crest cell hypothesis doesn't
quite explain every bit of domestication syndrome. Like—what's going on with other tame species
that do have upright ears? This be might be the excuse scientists need
to spend more time with their pets. This is Skunk Bear—NPR's science show Please subscribe and check out some papers about the neural crest cell hypothesis down in the description.

**Transcript**:
In Margaret Atwood's near-future novel,
"The Handmaid's Tale," a Christian fundamentalist regime
called the Republic of Gilead has staged a military coup
and established a theocratic government in the United States. The regime theoretically 
restricts everyone, but in practice a few men have structured
Gilead so they have all the power, especially over women. The Handmaid's Tale is what Atwood calls
speculative fiction, meaning it theorizes 
about possible futures. This is a fundamental characteristic shared by both utopian 
and dystopian texts. The possible futures in Atwood's novels
are usually negative, or dystopian, where the actions of a small group
have destroyed society as we know it. Utopian and dystopian writing
tends to parallel political trends. Utopian writing frequently depicts
an idealized society that the author puts forth as a blueprint
to strive toward. Dystopias, on the other hand, are not necessarily predictions 
of apocalyptic futures, but rather warnings about the ways
in which societies can set themselves on the path to destruction. The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1985,
when many conservative groups attacked the gains made 
by the second-wave feminist movement. This movement had been advocating greater
social and legal equality for women since the early 1960s. The Handmaid's Tale imagines a future
in which the conservative counter-movement gains 
the upper hand and not only demolishes the progress
women had made toward equality, but makes women completely 
subservient to men. Gilead divides women in the regime
into distinct social classes based upon their function
as status symbols for men. Even their clothing is color-coded. Women are no longer allowed to read or move about freely in public, and fertile women are subject
to state-engineered rape in order to give birth to children
for the regime. Although The Handmaid's Tale
is set in the future, one of Atwood's self-imposed
rules in writing it was that she wouldn't use any event or practice that hadn't already 
happened in human history. The book is set 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city that during 
the American colonial period had been ruled by the theocratic Puritans. In many ways, the Republic of Gilead
resembles the strict rules that were present in Puritan society: rigid moral codes, modest clothing, banishment of dissenters, and regulation of every aspect 
of people's lives and relationships. For Atwood, the parallels 
to Massachusett's Puritans were personal as well as theoretical. She spent several years studying
the Puritans at Harvard and she's possibly descended from
Mary Webster, a Puritan woman accused
of witchcraft who survived her hanging. Atwood is a master storyteller. The details of Gilead, 
which we've only skimmed the surface of, slowly come into focus through the eyes
of its characters, mainly the novel's protagonist Offred, a handmaid in the household 
of a commander. Before the coup that established Gilead, Offred had a husband, a child, a job,
and a normal, middle-class American life. But when the fundamentalist regime
comes into power, Offred is denied her identity, separated from her family, and reduced to being, in Offred's words, "a two-legged womb for increasing 
Gilead's waning population." She initially accepts the loss 
of her fundamental human rights in the name of stabilizing 
the new government. But state control soon extends
into attempts to control the language, behavior, and thoughts of herself
and other individuals. Early on, Offred says, "I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must compose, 
as one composes a speech." She likens language 
to the formulation of identity. Her words also acknowledge 
the possibility of resistance, and it's resistance, the actions of people
who dare to break the political, intellectual, and sexual rules, that drives the plot 
of the Handmaid's Tale. Ultimately, the novel's exploration
of the consequences of complacency, and how power can be wielded unfairly, makes Atwood's chilling vision
of a dystopian regime ever relevant.

**Transcript**:
In Margaret Atwood's near-future novel,
"The Handmaid's Tale," a Christian fundamentalist regime
called the Republic of Gilead has staged a military coup
and established a theocratic government in the United States. The regime theoretically 
restricts everyone, but in practice a few men have structured
Gilead so they have all the power, especially over women. The Handmaid's Tale is what Atwood calls
speculative fiction, meaning it theorizes 
about possible futures. This is a fundamental characteristic shared by both utopian 
and dystopian texts. The possible futures in Atwood's novels
are usually negative, or dystopian, where the actions of a small group
have destroyed society as we know it. Utopian and dystopian writing
tends to parallel political trends. Utopian writing frequently depicts
an idealized society that the author puts forth as a blueprint
to strive toward. Dystopias, on the other hand, are not necessarily predictions 
of apocalyptic futures, but rather warnings about the ways
in which societies can set themselves on the path to destruction. The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1985,
when many conservative groups attacked the gains made 
by the second-wave feminist movement. This movement had been advocating greater
social and legal equality for women since the early 1960s. The Handmaid's Tale imagines a future
in which the conservative counter-movement gains 
the upper hand and not only demolishes the progress
women had made toward equality, but makes women completely 
subservient to men. Gilead divides women in the regime
into distinct social classes based upon their function
as status symbols for men. Even their clothing is color-coded. Women are no longer allowed to read or move about freely in public, and fertile women are subject
to state-engineered rape in order to give birth to children
for the regime. Although The Handmaid's Tale
is set in the future, one of Atwood's self-imposed
rules in writing it was that she wouldn't use any event or practice that hadn't already 
happened in human history. The book is set 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city that during 
the American colonial period had been ruled by the theocratic Puritans. In many ways, the Republic of Gilead
resembles the strict rules that were present in Puritan society: rigid moral codes, modest clothing, banishment of dissenters, and regulation of every aspect 
of people's lives and relationships. For Atwood, the parallels 
to Massachusett's Puritans were personal as well as theoretical. She spent several years studying
the Puritans at Harvard and she's possibly descended from
Mary Webster, a Puritan woman accused
of witchcraft who survived her hanging. Atwood is a master storyteller. The details of Gilead, 
which we've only skimmed the surface of, slowly come into focus through the eyes
of its characters, mainly the novel's protagonist Offred, a handmaid in the household 
of a commander. Before the coup that established Gilead, Offred had a husband, a child, a job,
and a normal, middle-class American life. But when the fundamentalist regime
comes into power, Offred is denied her identity, separated from her family, and reduced to being, in Offred's words, "a two-legged womb for increasing 
Gilead's waning population." She initially accepts the loss 
of her fundamental human rights in the name of stabilizing 
the new government. But state control soon extends
into attempts to control the language, behavior, and thoughts of herself
and other individuals. Early on, Offred says, "I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must compose, 
as one composes a speech." She likens language 
to the formulation of identity. Her words also acknowledge 
the possibility of resistance, and it's resistance, the actions of people
who dare to break the political, intellectual, and sexual rules, that drives the plot 
of the Handmaid's Tale. Ultimately, the novel's exploration
of the consequences of complacency, and how power can be wielded unfairly, makes Atwood's chilling vision
of a dystopian regime ever relevant.

**Transcript**:
Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead through
the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm 34 years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly
to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor; I'm a chef, I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information, education. I profoundly believe
that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful, awful reality right now. America, you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy
countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have
children in this room today? Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up,
aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We, the adults of the last
four generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents. Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food
that we've built around them. Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically
overweight or obese. You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry. (Laughter) The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid
about death, murder, homicide, you name it; it's on the front page
of every paper, CNN. Look at homicide
at the bottom, for God's sake. Right? (Laughter) (Applause) Every single one of those in the red
is a diet-related disease. Any doctor, any specialist
will tell you that. Fact: diet-related disease
is the biggest killer in the United States,
right now, here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you, as usual. (Laughter) I know they were close,
but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems
of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans
10 percent of your health-care bills, 150 billion dollars a year. In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year. Let's be honest, guys,
you haven't got that cash. (Laughter) I came here to start a food revolution
that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping-point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America
for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe --
ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia,
the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year,
but we'll work on that next season. (Laughter) Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people, your public, around the statistics
that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you
to some of the people that I care about: your public, your children. I want to show a picture
of my friend Brittany. She's 16 years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up
within a food environment where they've been taught
to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy, the Edwards family. This is a normal family, guys. Stacy does her best,
but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook
at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here, 12 years old,
he's 350 pounds. He gets bullied, for God's sake. The daughter there, Katie,
she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets
to primary school. Marissa, she's all right,
she's one of your lot. But you know what? Her father, who was obese,
died in her arms, And then the second
most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families,
brothers, sisters. Pastor Steve: an inspirational man, one of my early allies
in Huntington, West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife-edge
of this problem. He has to bury the people, OK? And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends,
his family, his community. Come winter, three times
as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease.
Waste of life. By the way, this is
what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door,
and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK, I see it as a triangle, OK? This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped
the heart out of this country? Let's be frank and honest. Well, modern-day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over
the whole country; we know that. The big brands are
some of the most important powers, powerful powers, in this country. (Sighs) Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed
and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients,
and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously
a massive, massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country
is a disgrace. The industry wants
to self-police themselves. What, in this kind of climate?
They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low-fat
when it's full of so much sugar? Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart
of passing on food culture, what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know, as we go
to work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have
to look at it holistically -- step back for a moment,
and re-address the balance. It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now;
the Edwards family. (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk. This stuff goes through you
and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill
your children early. How are you feeling? Stacy: Just feeling really sad
and depressed right now. But, you know, I want
my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO: Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much
a specialist in. OK, school. What is school? Who invented it?
What's the purpose of school? School was always invented
to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc. You know, it's been kind of in this sort
of tight box for a long, long time, OK? But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health
catastrophes of America, OK? School food is something that most kids --
31 million a day, actually -- have twice a day, more than often,
breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year. So you could say that school
food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances. (Laughter) Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for -- (Laughter) I need to say one thing,
and it's so important in, hopefully, the magic
that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies,
the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being
told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any,
food-knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem: If you're not a food expert,
and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter,
then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive
and write different things around things. If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do
in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get
every day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough
fresh food in there at all. You know, the amount
of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe -- there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast.
They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks?
No, they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No. And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives
and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food,
because it's handheld. And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas,
it's all of that stuff. (Sighs) Ten percent of what we spend
on health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right
to teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK? We don't teach kids about food, right? And this is a little clip
from an elementary school, which is very common in England. (Video) Who knows what this is? Child: Potatoes. Jamie Oliver: Potato?
So, you think these are potatoes? Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is? Child: Broccoli? JO: What about this? Our good old friend. Child: Celery. JO: No. What do you think this is? Child: Onion.
JO: Onion? No. JO: Immediately you
get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything
about where food comes from?" Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear? JO: What do you think this is?
Child: I don't know. JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it. (Laughter) JO: Normal. England and America, England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one-hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids
about food in schools, period. (Applause) I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble
that we're in, guys, OK? I want to talk about something
so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk
at school, breakfast and lunch, right? They'll be having two bottles, OK? And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong, I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money
for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples
they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean? For me, there isn't any need
to flavor the milk. Okay? There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs
of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern-day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar
as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop, and they are having two a day. So, let me just show you. We've got one kid, here -- having, you know,
eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know, there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years
of elementary school sugar, just from milk. Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics
and the evidence, and they would find any government
of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I came up here, and I wish
I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting
and scrambling to get to me. This, all this bad news, is preventable. That's the good news. It's very, very preventable. So, let's just think about,
we got a problem here, we need to reboot. Okay so, in my world,
what do we need to do? Here is the thing, right, it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you
in the white of the eyes and say, "In 10 years' time, the history of your children's lives, happiness -- and let's not forget,
you're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff,
it will look different. OK?" So, supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously? Week in, week out. How much money do you spend,
in your life, in a supermarket? Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador
in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook
quick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some, and it needs
to be done across the board in America soon, and quick. The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education
at the heart of their businesses. I know, easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive. I've had loads
of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean, basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar,
salt and fat, and x, y, and z, and everyone loves them, right? So, these guys are going
to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors
and the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar and all the other
non-food ingredients. Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier,
is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK, school. Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year, from that little precious age of four, until 18, 20, 24, whatever, they need to be cooked proper, fresh food from local growers on site, OK? There needs to be a new
standard of fresh, proper food for your children, yeah? (Applause) Under the circumstances,
it's profoundly important that every single
American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life. Life skills. (Applause) That means that they can be
students, young parents, and be able to sort of duck and dive
around the basics of cooking, no matter what recession hits
them next time. If you can cook,
recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook, time doesn't matter. The workplace, we haven't
really talked about it. You know, it's now time
for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed
or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads
of America's children. Marissa, her father died in her hand, I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start
feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now, look, if we do
all this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on
cooking again, for sure. For sure, pass it on as a philosophy. And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person
teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole
population of America. Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts
makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington, where I made this program, we've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people
to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen.
I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area
from the junk, onto the fresh food: six-and-a-half grand per school. (Applause) That's all it takes,
six-and-a-half grand per school. The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay? This can do 5,000 people a year, which is 10 percent of their population, and it's people on people. You know, it's local cooks
teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons,
guys, in the Main Street. This is real, tangible change,
real, tangible change. Around America, if we just look back now, there is plenty of wonderful
things going on. There is plenty of beautiful
things going on. There are angels
around America doing great things in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups, garden set-ups, education -- there are amazing people
doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts
and the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them
to easily find the resource to keep rolling out
what they're already doing, and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things
that she wants to do. (Applause) And look, I know it's weird having an English person
standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is: I care. I'm a father, and I love this country. And I believe truly, actually, that if change can be made
in this country, beautiful things will happen
around the world. If America does it,
other people will follow. It's incredibly important. (Audience) Yeah! (Applause) When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work
when they weren't, I thought "If I had a magic wand,
what would I do?" And I thought, "You know what? I'd just love to be put in front
of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America." And a month later, TED phoned me up
and gave me this award. I'm here. So, my wish. Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong,
sustainable movement to educate every child about food, to inspire families to cook again, and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause continues)

**Transcript**:
Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead through
the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm 34 years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly
to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor; I'm a chef, I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information, education. I profoundly believe
that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful, awful reality right now. America, you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy
countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have
children in this room today? Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up,
aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We, the adults of the last
four generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents. Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food
that we've built around them. Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically
overweight or obese. You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry. (Laughter) The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid
about death, murder, homicide, you name it; it's on the front page
of every paper, CNN. Look at homicide
at the bottom, for God's sake. Right? (Laughter) (Applause) Every single one of those in the red
is a diet-related disease. Any doctor, any specialist
will tell you that. Fact: diet-related disease
is the biggest killer in the United States,
right now, here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you, as usual. (Laughter) I know they were close,
but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems
of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans
10 percent of your health-care bills, 150 billion dollars a year. In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year. Let's be honest, guys,
you haven't got that cash. (Laughter) I came here to start a food revolution
that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping-point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America
for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe --
ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia,
the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year,
but we'll work on that next season. (Laughter) Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people, your public, around the statistics
that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you
to some of the people that I care about: your public, your children. I want to show a picture
of my friend Brittany. She's 16 years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up
within a food environment where they've been taught
to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy, the Edwards family. This is a normal family, guys. Stacy does her best,
but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook
at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here, 12 years old,
he's 350 pounds. He gets bullied, for God's sake. The daughter there, Katie,
she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets
to primary school. Marissa, she's all right,
she's one of your lot. But you know what? Her father, who was obese,
died in her arms, And then the second
most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families,
brothers, sisters. Pastor Steve: an inspirational man, one of my early allies
in Huntington, West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife-edge
of this problem. He has to bury the people, OK? And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends,
his family, his community. Come winter, three times
as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease.
Waste of life. By the way, this is
what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door,
and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK, I see it as a triangle, OK? This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped
the heart out of this country? Let's be frank and honest. Well, modern-day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over
the whole country; we know that. The big brands are
some of the most important powers, powerful powers, in this country. (Sighs) Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed
and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients,
and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously
a massive, massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country
is a disgrace. The industry wants
to self-police themselves. What, in this kind of climate?
They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low-fat
when it's full of so much sugar? Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart
of passing on food culture, what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know, as we go
to work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have
to look at it holistically -- step back for a moment,
and re-address the balance. It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now;
the Edwards family. (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk. This stuff goes through you
and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill
your children early. How are you feeling? Stacy: Just feeling really sad
and depressed right now. But, you know, I want
my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO: Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much
a specialist in. OK, school. What is school? Who invented it?
What's the purpose of school? School was always invented
to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc. You know, it's been kind of in this sort
of tight box for a long, long time, OK? But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health
catastrophes of America, OK? School food is something that most kids --
31 million a day, actually -- have twice a day, more than often,
breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year. So you could say that school
food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances. (Laughter) Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for -- (Laughter) I need to say one thing,
and it's so important in, hopefully, the magic
that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies,
the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being
told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any,
food-knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem: If you're not a food expert,
and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter,
then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive
and write different things around things. If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do
in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get
every day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough
fresh food in there at all. You know, the amount
of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe -- there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast.
They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks?
No, they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No. And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives
and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food,
because it's handheld. And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas,
it's all of that stuff. (Sighs) Ten percent of what we spend
on health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right
to teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK? We don't teach kids about food, right? And this is a little clip
from an elementary school, which is very common in England. (Video) Who knows what this is? Child: Potatoes. Jamie Oliver: Potato?
So, you think these are potatoes? Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is? Child: Broccoli? JO: What about this? Our good old friend. Child: Celery. JO: No. What do you think this is? Child: Onion.
JO: Onion? No. JO: Immediately you
get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything
about where food comes from?" Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear? JO: What do you think this is?
Child: I don't know. JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it. (Laughter) JO: Normal. England and America, England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one-hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids
about food in schools, period. (Applause) I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble
that we're in, guys, OK? I want to talk about something
so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk
at school, breakfast and lunch, right? They'll be having two bottles, OK? And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong, I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money
for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples
they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean? For me, there isn't any need
to flavor the milk. Okay? There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs
of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern-day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar
as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop, and they are having two a day. So, let me just show you. We've got one kid, here -- having, you know,
eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know, there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years
of elementary school sugar, just from milk. Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics
and the evidence, and they would find any government
of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I came up here, and I wish
I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting
and scrambling to get to me. This, all this bad news, is preventable. That's the good news. It's very, very preventable. So, let's just think about,
we got a problem here, we need to reboot. Okay so, in my world,
what do we need to do? Here is the thing, right, it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you
in the white of the eyes and say, "In 10 years' time, the history of your children's lives, happiness -- and let's not forget,
you're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff,
it will look different. OK?" So, supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously? Week in, week out. How much money do you spend,
in your life, in a supermarket? Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador
in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook
quick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some, and it needs
to be done across the board in America soon, and quick. The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education
at the heart of their businesses. I know, easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive. I've had loads
of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean, basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar,
salt and fat, and x, y, and z, and everyone loves them, right? So, these guys are going
to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors
and the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar and all the other
non-food ingredients. Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier,
is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK, school. Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year, from that little precious age of four, until 18, 20, 24, whatever, they need to be cooked proper, fresh food from local growers on site, OK? There needs to be a new
standard of fresh, proper food for your children, yeah? (Applause) Under the circumstances,
it's profoundly important that every single
American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life. Life skills. (Applause) That means that they can be
students, young parents, and be able to sort of duck and dive
around the basics of cooking, no matter what recession hits
them next time. If you can cook,
recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook, time doesn't matter. The workplace, we haven't
really talked about it. You know, it's now time
for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed
or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads
of America's children. Marissa, her father died in her hand, I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start
feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now, look, if we do
all this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on
cooking again, for sure. For sure, pass it on as a philosophy. And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person
teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole
population of America. Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts
makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington, where I made this program, we've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people
to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen.
I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area
from the junk, onto the fresh food: six-and-a-half grand per school. (Applause) That's all it takes,
six-and-a-half grand per school. The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay? This can do 5,000 people a year, which is 10 percent of their population, and it's people on people. You know, it's local cooks
teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons,
guys, in the Main Street. This is real, tangible change,
real, tangible change. Around America, if we just look back now, there is plenty of wonderful
things going on. There is plenty of beautiful
things going on. There are angels
around America doing great things in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups, garden set-ups, education -- there are amazing people
doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts
and the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them
to easily find the resource to keep rolling out
what they're already doing, and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things
that she wants to do. (Applause) And look, I know it's weird having an English person
standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is: I care. I'm a father, and I love this country. And I believe truly, actually, that if change can be made
in this country, beautiful things will happen
around the world. If America does it,
other people will follow. It's incredibly important. (Audience) Yeah! (Applause) When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work
when they weren't, I thought "If I had a magic wand,
what would I do?" And I thought, "You know what? I'd just love to be put in front
of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America." And a month later, TED phoned me up
and gave me this award. I'm here. So, my wish. Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong,
sustainable movement to educate every child about food, to inspire families to cook again, and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause continues)

**Transcript**:
In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults.

eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults.

**Transcript**:
In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So today we're in the rocket van and I've got two little science helpers here right? Kids: Yes, right. Are you wearing your seatbelts? Yes. OK we're gonna do something pretty interesting. Check this out. I've got a pendulum suspended from the top of our family van and we're just gonna drive forward, we're gonna accelerate, so if we're going that way, which direction do you think this pendulum should go? What do you think? 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Kids: Yes. Which way is it going? Kids: My way. That's right. It's because I'm accelerating right? Does that make sense to you guys? Yes sir. OK very good, I was hoping it would make sense. So we're gonna change it up just a little bit. OK so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna replace this pendulum with a balloon. We should see the same thing right? Let me cut this off. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna accelerate that way so we have the mass of the balloon and the acceleration that should net in a force and will have to react with this string right? You guys ready? Yes sir. 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Wait a second. What just happened? What happens when I stop? The balloon goes backwards when I stop. What's happening? 3.. 2.. 1..Go. There it is. It's coming right at me. Why's it doing that? Do you wanna know? Yeah. Alright, I brought something to show you. You remember I told you I was gonna bring this jar earlier? Remember that? So it's like this. Imagine this entire van is just like this jar, and all the air inside this van is just like the water in the jar. Does that make sense? So let's imagine that the balloon is this bubble on top, because the helium in the balloon is lighter than air right? So that causes it to do what? Kids: Go up. Go up, that's right. So if I've got this air that's just like it, what happens if I move the jar that way? All that water sloshes to the back. And when that water sloshes back this way, which direction does the bubble go? You see that? So the air bubble moves in the direction of acceleration, does that make sense? I know you're five but I think you can get this. OK so I've got my seatbelt on. If I drive forward real fast right now which direction is the balloon gonna go? Forward. Why will it go forward? Because all the air's sloshing back. That's right! Very good! Watch this. Look at that. You see that? So you know what that means don't you? That means you have more air to breathe than daddy does when I'm going fast. Did you realise that? Kids: Nooo! Yeah that means when I go fast, that means more air sloshes back there to you and you have more oxygen to breathe. Doesn't it feel good back there? OK so now we have the plumb bob right next to the balloon, so if I go forward they should spread apart right? Let's check it out. Is it working? Kids: Yeah. So what I want to do is I want to tell everybody on Smarter Every Day that if they go download a free audio book that it'll help Smarter Every Day by sponsoring us. Audible will, if they go to audible.com/smarter. And so they get a free audio book, but I'm gonna do it in a funny way. Now lean in towards me and look straight at the camera. I know you don't know what I'm gonna do but don't laugh because I want people to realize that they can send you to school if they get a audio book. Does that make sense? Yeah. So whatever happens don't laugh. OK? Look straight at the camera. Ready? You don't know what I'm doing, do you? OK you ready? (High pitched helium voice) Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day and if you would please download an audio book at audible.com/smarter. Did you know daddy could talk like this? No. You didn't know that happened, did you? So if you go get a free audio book it'll support Smarter Every Day and it'll help me send these kids to school. Does that sound like a good idea? Yes. You should never do that, by the way. That's only for adults. How'd you do that? It's magical. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Please subscribe to Smarter Every Day and support our sponsor audible, I'll leave a link somewhere and you can check it out. Thanks, bye. How'd you change your voice? OK now we have the sunroof, the side window and the back open. I'm gonna go forward, where do you think it's gonna go? Daughter: Forward. Son: Backwards. 3.. 2.. 1.. Dad: So this is air, not helium? Yes sir. OK I think it's gonna act like the pendulum. Dad: 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. (laughs) Backwards. Oh it does. We're gonna use that one.

**Transcript**:
Your interstellar police squad
has tracked a group of dangerous rebels to a cluster of of seven small planets. Now you must apprehend them quickly 
before their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put. They’ll try to dodge you
by moving from planet to planet. But you have one major advantage. Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser 
can warp between any two planets, while their beat-up smuggling ship can only jump to an adjacent planet 
in that same time. These rebels don’t like to stay put. Every time they can relocate, they will. Your scouts tell you that the approaching
rebel fleet is 10 hours away. You can’t risk letting the rebels escape. Can you devise a sequence 
for searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them 
in 10 warps or less, no matter what moves they make? Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy. For one, you have no way of knowing which 
planet they’re on to begin with. And without that information, it’s hard 
to determine where they’ll move next. So where do you begin? When tackling problems of this kind 
it often helps to simplify things, so you can better understand 
their dynamics. Let’s imagine that this cluster 
has the same arrangement but no outermost planets,
leaving only the four in the center. We still don’t know which planet 
the rebels start on. But there’s one key feature: the third planet 
is adjacent to all others, which means the rebels either start there 
and move somewhere else, or start on one of the other planets and have no choice 
but to move to planet three. Simply checking planet three
twice in a row would do the trick. Adding the three outer planet 
adds a bit more complexity, but the same strategy remains. We want to check the planets in an order 
that will eventually corner the rebels. And there’s another insight 
that can help us: each hour, the rebels move from 
an even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. This gives us a way 
to simplify the problem by dividing the planets into two subsets, and tackling each one separately. For starters, let’s assume the rebels 
begin on an even-numbered planet: either two, four, or six. So we’ll search planet two first. If they’re not there, they must have 
started on either four or six. which means they can move to three, five, or seven. Planet three at the center gives them 
the most options for their next move, so we’ll want to check there next. If we don’t find them, they must have been
at planet five or seven, meaning they’ll next move to four or six. Let’s now search planet four. If they’re not there, they must have gone 
to the sixth planet and can only flee to three or seven. If we next scour planet three 
and don’t find them, we know they went to planet seven 
and are now cornered. They can only move to planet six, where
we’ll apprehend them on our fifth search. Of course, this plan only works assuming that the rebels were on 
an even-numbered planet in the first hour. But what if that assumption was wrong? In that case, they must’ve started 
on an odd-numbered planet. And because they move to an adjacent 
planet every hour, their location must alternate between
odd and even-numbered planets. This means that if they were on 
an odd-numbered planet to start, after five moves, they'd be 
on an even-numbered planet. So if our first five searches missed them because our assumption that they started 
on an even-numbered planet was wrong, all we have to do now 
is repeat the sequence! Searching the planets in order two, three, four, three, six, two, three, four, three, six, leaves the rebels nowhere to run. Thanks to your deductive reasoning, 
order is restored to the galaxy.

**Transcript**:
Your interstellar police squad
has tracked a group of dangerous rebels to a cluster of of seven small planets. Now you must apprehend them quickly 
before their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put. They’ll try to dodge you
by moving from planet to planet. But you have one major advantage. Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser 
can warp between any two planets, while their beat-up smuggling ship can only jump to an adjacent planet 
in that same time. These rebels don’t like to stay put. Every time they can relocate, they will. Your scouts tell you that the approaching
rebel fleet is 10 hours away. You can’t risk letting the rebels escape. Can you devise a sequence 
for searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them 
in 10 warps or less, no matter what moves they make? Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy. For one, you have no way of knowing which 
planet they’re on to begin with. And without that information, it’s hard 
to determine where they’ll move next. So where do you begin? When tackling problems of this kind 
it often helps to simplify things, so you can better understand 
their dynamics. Let’s imagine that this cluster 
has the same arrangement but no outermost planets,
leaving only the four in the center. We still don’t know which planet 
the rebels start on. But there’s one key feature: the third planet 
is adjacent to all others, which means the rebels either start there 
and move somewhere else, or start on one of the other planets and have no choice 
but to move to planet three. Simply checking planet three
twice in a row would do the trick. Adding the three outer planet 
adds a bit more complexity, but the same strategy remains. We want to check the planets in an order 
that will eventually corner the rebels. And there’s another insight 
that can help us: each hour, the rebels move from 
an even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. This gives us a way 
to simplify the problem by dividing the planets into two subsets, and tackling each one separately. For starters, let’s assume the rebels 
begin on an even-numbered planet: either two, four, or six. So we’ll search planet two first. If they’re not there, they must have 
started on either four or six. which means they can move to three, five, or seven. Planet three at the center gives them 
the most options for their next move, so we’ll want to check there next. If we don’t find them, they must have been
at planet five or seven, meaning they’ll next move to four or six. Let’s now search planet four. If they’re not there, they must have gone 
to the sixth planet and can only flee to three or seven. If we next scour planet three 
and don’t find them, we know they went to planet seven 
and are now cornered. They can only move to planet six, where
we’ll apprehend them on our fifth search. Of course, this plan only works assuming that the rebels were on 
an even-numbered planet in the first hour. But what if that assumption was wrong? In that case, they must’ve started 
on an odd-numbered planet. And because they move to an adjacent 
planet every hour, their location must alternate between
odd and even-numbered planets. This means that if they were on 
an odd-numbered planet to start, after five moves, they'd be 
on an even-numbered planet. So if our first five searches missed them because our assumption that they started 
on an even-numbered planet was wrong, all we have to do now 
is repeat the sequence! Searching the planets in order two, three, four, three, six, two, three, four, three, six, leaves the rebels nowhere to run. Thanks to your deductive reasoning, 
order is restored to the galaxy.

take a look at this photo something really really cool happening in this photo can you tell what it is is it stage fright she's got sweaty palms maybe butterflies in her belly is it an aha moment whatever it is it's an I have something to say moment who's out there in the audience though will she make them laugh will she make them think what about the millions that might be watching online who will hear her words as a call to action whatever it is that's on our mind mrs. and I have something to say moment you guys have had these before right the sense of urgency it's full of a need a physical need to say that thing right now this moment the moment in which a human shares her or his idea with another person or other people has been happening since we've had words to express ideas I think it's one of the most important moments that happens in our human development in this moment we can shut down or we can speak up we can be shut down or we can be asked to speak up so that others in the room can hear we can be ignored or we can be heard what happens to us in these moments what we do with them how they're received whether or not they're encouraged determines so much about how we engage with the rest of the world about how we decide to act the next time we have one of these moments so the history of the origin of human language is a talk for a different day and incidentally it is something it is a very very deep rabbit hole to get into when you're procrastinating on something else that you should be doing despite lots of competing efforts theories as to how and when we started doing this it does seem like we humans have been communicating as a tool to advance humanity and as a measurement of our progress as a species human connection the ability to communicate to warn each other to ask questions to use our collective voice it's what saves us from danger it's what solves problems it's what makes us human as humans we've developed a lot of tools to kind of help us along the way in terms of of giving potential power to this moment we've created a lot of things the first alphabet the first book the first telegram the first telephone it's a sexy one the first radio the first TV this is where things start to speed up a little bit the first VCR the internet the first social network and the first smart phone that's right each of these inventions helped a human's voice go farther and faster than it ever had before but with the advent of each of these tools we see a pattern at first they're available to who to the wealthy to the powerful right the people who are able to communicate who are able to share their ideas were the philosophers the inventors the military guys in suits eventually though over a long period of time each of these tools makes communication more accessible here's the crazy thing about our modern world though the internet and I say this carefully because I realized that we have a lot of debilitating accessibility issues that we still need to work through but the internet and the things that go along with it social networks and smartphones are making communication more accessible than it ever has been before this is an especially big deal because unlike the VCR or the TV or even radio these new technologies allow you you not just the rich and the powerful but you to connect to the world outside of right here beyond the walls of your bedroom beyond your in unprecedented ways today all you need to get to get a voice out there is one glowing rectangle and some bandwidth this means that you no longer have to be part of some elite class to share your ideas with the world right thanks to smartphones and YouTube you can be this 10 year old kid sitting in his mom's after basketball practice Nyame is one example that says a lot about why we might be smarter as a society to get out of the way and invest more time in young people sharing their thoughts and ideas there are lots of other reasons for this really it just makes good sense you all are the ones that have the biggest the largest amount of time left to solve the big problems that we have not really been able to make too much of a dent in also you're naturally better equipped than we are to solve these problems you all are the first native speakers of this digital language you're the ones who are experts at Twitter and snapchat and whatever that new thing is that's probably come out during the time that I've been speaking that you've already mastered I think Celia over there probably already has 12 viral snap twit chats whatever the new thing is gonna be called already experts at it this is something that is additionally important because you all don't see things that can't be done you see things you haven't done yet you naturally question what we old consider to be the status quo because quite frankly your status hasn't been quote yet like to me this is the box that my Vitamix came in I don't I don't have a Vitamix I don't know why I said that to me this is a box to a seven-year-old it's a lab for doing experiments or a sweet plane to practice your upside down flight loops in or something that can take you all the way to Pluto because when you're seven you don't judge Pluto for having its planetary status downgraded you think sweet Pluto I am totally going there you'll pick the uncomfortable fight that we tiptoe around every day you'll name the elephant in the room because there's a freaking elephant in the room okay so this is these are the reasons that I think that you all are better equipped to handle these problems than we are so y'all got this all right Celia you're in charge no I'm kidding I'm kidding but this is the kind of thing that we actually do right we say that youth voice is important but that's a lot different than really giving it space to flourish it's a lot different than actually listening so I did a lot of prep as any expert would for this talk but what struck me was that I what I probably should do is get out of the way work to create some space for young people to share their ideas and then step aside which is exactly what my program there are over two billion school-aged individuals living in the world today that's more young people than any other time in human history and it's this generations creativity their actions their art their poetry their protests their questions their code their dreams it's this generations ideas that will define the future of our world one well articulated idea can reach and inspire millions that's why Ted's youth and education initiative Ted ed has created a program that's dedicated to sparking and celebrating the best ideas of young people around the world it was to create more confident individuals it was Eric lebas was won by us for the program is called ted-ed clubs it supports students in identifying their passions learning public speaking skills connecting with a global network of classrooms and sharing student ideas in the form of short TED style talks here's how it works participating students and teachers gain access to a free and flexible curriculum they can use to start a TED ed Club at their school each suggested meeting uses TED Talks to help students engage in critical thinking exercises and gain invaluable presentation skills in the final meeting students are invited to give their own TED talk and if they record their talk they can upload it to Ted Ed's award-winning platform where it can be referenced on a resume a college application and shared with participating clubs around the world over two billion young people empowered and encouraged to share their ideas imagine that future and bring TED ed clubs to your community today we are not the only organization that is trying to amplify youth voices FIRST Robotics inspires young people to become leaders in science and technology by having them design and build and program robots that solve real-world engineering challenges the YMCA Youth in government program encourages young people to take over state and national governments by researching debating and voting on policy issues that they care about for their own governments not that there's anything wrong with the way that my country or yours has been handling our governments lately the Stanford design schools project Wayfarer focuses on helping teens discover and navigate a path for their future for your future based on your unique qualities rather than some prepackaged school subjects each of these efforts have same fundamental assumption you have something uniquely valuable to say right now not in some distant future time when all of a sudden you go from becoming the leaders of tomorrow to right now leaders so what kinds of things do we talk about what kinds of things are on your mind well society like feeds off of insecurity and I think everyone should learn to like your peers and they know your bullying stress body image have been viewed on our platform over a million times these students are leaders right now in today's world everywhere you go is a potential stage your kitchen your mom's front seat your classroom and many of you are carrying a device in your pocket that will carry your thoughts your dreams your voice across the world you can connect to other cultures and perspectives you can brainstorm and collaborate in ways that I will never be able to understand because I don't get snapchat filters and I never will most importantly though you're all carrying a story that is uniquely yours it is your something to say just like this young girl has her something to say right on the tip of her tongue this moment frozen in time represents you and the millions of young people just like you and also not at all like you who will have thoughts ideas questions and curiosities and if you're brave enough to say it to share it it can travel farther and do more good now than any other time in history so I'm gonna get off the stage now because it's your turn what do you want to do with it thank you [Applause]

**Transcript**:
take a look at this photo something really really cool happening in this photo can you tell what it is is it stage fright she's got sweaty palms maybe butterflies in her belly is it an aha moment whatever it is it's an I have something to say moment who's out there in the audience though will she make them laugh will she make them think what about the millions that might be watching online who will hear her words as a call to action whatever it is that's on our mind mrs. and I have something to say moment you guys have had these before right the sense of urgency it's full of a need a physical need to say that thing right now this moment the moment in which a human shares her or his idea with another person or other people has been happening since we've had words to express ideas I think it's one of the most important moments that happens in our human development in this moment we can shut down or we can speak up we can be shut down or we can be asked to speak up so that others in the room can hear we can be ignored or we can be heard what happens to us in these moments what we do with them how they're received whether or not they're encouraged determines so much about how we engage with the rest of the world about how we decide to act the next time we have one of these moments so the history of the origin of human language is a talk for a different day and incidentally it is something it is a very very deep rabbit hole to get into when you're procrastinating on something else that you should be doing despite lots of competing efforts theories as to how and when we started doing this it does seem like we humans have been communicating as a tool to advance humanity and as a measurement of our progress as a species human connection the ability to communicate to warn each other to ask questions to use our collective voice it's what saves us from danger it's what solves problems it's what makes us human as humans we've developed a lot of tools to kind of help us along the way in terms of of giving potential power to this moment we've created a lot of things the first alphabet the first book the first telegram the first telephone it's a sexy one the first radio the first TV this is where things start to speed up a little bit the first VCR the internet the first social network and the first smart phone that's right each of these inventions helped a human's voice go farther and faster than it ever had before but with the advent of each of these tools we see a pattern at first they're available to who to the wealthy to the powerful right the people who are able to communicate who are able to share their ideas were the philosophers the inventors the military guys in suits eventually though over a long period of time each of these tools makes communication more accessible here's the crazy thing about our modern world though the internet and I say this carefully because I realized that we have a lot of debilitating accessibility issues that we still need to work through but the internet and the things that go along with it social networks and smartphones are making communication more accessible than it ever has been before this is an especially big deal because unlike the VCR or the TV or even radio these new technologies allow you you not just the rich and the powerful but you to connect to the world outside of right here beyond the walls of your bedroom beyond your in unprecedented ways today all you need to get to get a voice out there is one glowing rectangle and some bandwidth this means that you no longer have to be part of some elite class to share your ideas with the world right thanks to smartphones and YouTube you can be this 10 year old kid sitting in his mom's after basketball practice Nyame is one example that says a lot about why we might be smarter as a society to get out of the way and invest more time in young people sharing their thoughts and ideas there are lots of other reasons for this really it just makes good sense you all are the ones that have the biggest the largest amount of time left to solve the big problems that we have not really been able to make too much of a dent in also you're naturally better equipped than we are to solve these problems you all are the first native speakers of this digital language you're the ones who are experts at Twitter and snapchat and whatever that new thing is that's probably come out during the time that I've been speaking that you've already mastered I think Celia over there probably already has 12 viral snap twit chats whatever the new thing is gonna be called already experts at it this is something that is additionally important because you all don't see things that can't be done you see things you haven't done yet you naturally question what we old consider to be the status quo because quite frankly your status hasn't been quote yet like to me this is the box that my Vitamix came in I don't I don't have a Vitamix I don't know why I said that to me this is a box to a seven-year-old it's a lab for doing experiments or a sweet plane to practice your upside down flight loops in or something that can take you all the way to Pluto because when you're seven you don't judge Pluto for having its planetary status downgraded you think sweet Pluto I am totally going there you'll pick the uncomfortable fight that we tiptoe around every day you'll name the elephant in the room because there's a freaking elephant in the room okay so this is these are the reasons that I think that you all are better equipped to handle these problems than we are so y'all got this all right Celia you're in charge no I'm kidding I'm kidding but this is the kind of thing that we actually do right we say that youth voice is important but that's a lot different than really giving it space to flourish it's a lot different than actually listening so I did a lot of prep as any expert would for this talk but what struck me was that I what I probably should do is get out of the way work to create some space for young people to share their ideas and then step aside which is exactly what my program there are over two billion school-aged individuals living in the world today that's more young people than any other time in human history and it's this generations creativity their actions their art their poetry their protests their questions their code their dreams it's this generations ideas that will define the future of our world one well articulated idea can reach and inspire millions that's why Ted's youth and education initiative Ted ed has created a program that's dedicated to sparking and celebrating the best ideas of young people around the world it was to create more confident individuals it was Eric lebas was won by us for the program is called ted-ed clubs it supports students in identifying their passions learning public speaking skills connecting with a global network of classrooms and sharing student ideas in the form of short TED style talks here's how it works participating students and teachers gain access to a free and flexible curriculum they can use to start a TED ed Club at their school each suggested meeting uses TED Talks to help students engage in critical thinking exercises and gain invaluable presentation skills in the final meeting students are invited to give their own TED talk and if they record their talk they can upload it to Ted Ed's award-winning platform where it can be referenced on a resume a college application and shared with participating clubs around the world over two billion young people empowered and encouraged to share their ideas imagine that future and bring TED ed clubs to your community today we are not the only organization that is trying to amplify youth voices FIRST Robotics inspires young people to become leaders in science and technology by having them design and build and program robots that solve real-world engineering challenges the YMCA Youth in government program encourages young people to take over state and national governments by researching debating and voting on policy issues that they care about for their own governments not that there's anything wrong with the way that my country or yours has been handling our governments lately the Stanford design schools project Wayfarer focuses on helping teens discover and navigate a path for their future for your future based on your unique qualities rather than some prepackaged school subjects each of these efforts have same fundamental assumption you have something uniquely valuable to say right now not in some distant future time when all of a sudden you go from becoming the leaders of tomorrow to right now leaders so what kinds of things do we talk about what kinds of things are on your mind well society like feeds off of insecurity and I think everyone should learn to like your peers and they know your bullying stress body image have been viewed on our platform over a million times these students are leaders right now in today's world everywhere you go is a potential stage your kitchen your mom's front seat your classroom and many of you are carrying a device in your pocket that will carry your thoughts your dreams your voice across the world you can connect to other cultures and perspectives you can brainstorm and collaborate in ways that I will never be able to understand because I don't get snapchat filters and I never will most importantly though you're all carrying a story that is uniquely yours it is your something to say just like this young girl has her something to say right on the tip of her tongue this moment frozen in time represents you and the millions of young people just like you and also not at all like you who will have thoughts ideas questions and curiosities and if you're brave enough to say it to share it it can travel farther and do more good now than any other time in history so I'm gonna get off the stage now because it's your turn what do you want to do with it thank you [Applause]

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As a matter of fact, I was trying to think about my career
since I left the White House, and the best example I have is a cartoon
in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up
at his father, and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a former president." (Laughter) Well, I have had a great blessing
as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people
in the world have ever had to get to know so many people
around this whole universe. Not only am I familiar
with the 50 states in the United States, but also my wife and I have visited
more than 145 countries in the world, and the Carter Center has had full-time
programs in 80 nations on Earth. And a lot of times,
when we go into a country, we not only the meet
the king or the president, but we also meet the villagers who live
in the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment
at the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do,
I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse
of human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often,
is the abuse of women and girls. (Applause) There are a couple of reasons for this
that I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation
of religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament,
New Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men
who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches
and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules
to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated
to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem.
It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist,
a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach
Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention
in the year 2000 decided that women should play
a secondary position, a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests,
pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't
teach a man, and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures
are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer,
for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women
are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? Why should I pay them equal pay
for doing the same kind of work? The other very serious blight that causes this problem
is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing
tremendously around the world. In the United States of America,
for instance, we have had an enormous increase
in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities,
by putting them in prison. When I was in office
as governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans
were in prison. Nowadays, 7.3 people
per 1,000 are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase
in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have
[one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty
that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside
the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights
in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now,
and I figured out the other day that California has spent
four billion dollars in convicting 13 people
for the death penalty. If you add that up, that's 307 million
dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law
abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much. (Applause) So the resort to violence and abuse
of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase
in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few
abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
a limited amount of time, as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible
and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl,
very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away
by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and,
in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts
of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes, in more extreme cases
but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl
can just urinate or menstruate. And then later, when she gets married,
the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up
so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing, although
it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females
that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries,
it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way
before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing
is honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation,
again, of a holy scripture -- there's nothing in the Quran
that mandates this -- will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man
that her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she
wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members
of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings
so-called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt
not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent
of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father,
the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders
are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women
particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about 12.5 million people
sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in
the 19th century and the 18th century. There are 30 million people
now living in slavery. The United States Department of State
now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports
that 800,000 people are sold across international borders
every year into slavery, and that 80 percent
of those sold are women, into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living
in human bondage, or slavery. Atlanta, Georgia, where
the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women,
people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place
in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest
airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers
that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl
that has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars. A white-skinned girl brings
several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia. So this is another very serious problem,
and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not
a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief
of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one
of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought
increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps
and the male customers are prosecuted, and -- (Applause) --
prostitution has gone down. In the United States, we take
just the opposite position. For every male arrested
for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested
in the United States of America. Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now
towards this so-called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions
in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great
university system. In the military, they are now analyzing
how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got,
there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000. Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding
officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine,
or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer
has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want
is for anybody to know that under their command,
sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls
who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted
before she graduates, and this is now getting
a lot of publicity, partially because of my book,
but other things, and so 89 universities in America
are now condemned by the Department of Education
under Title IX because the officials of the universities
are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says
that more than half of the rapes on a college campus
take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody,
they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus,
they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things
that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious
about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know. (Applause) And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now
gets 23 percent less than a man. When I became president,
the difference was 39 percent. So we've made some progress,
partially because I was president and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) -- but in the last 15 years,
there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23
or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well, that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike
nation on Earth. We have been to war
with about 25 different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes, we've had soldiers
on the ground fighting. The other times,
we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times, of course, now, we have
drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war
with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years,
I won't say which ones, where we didn't -- (Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway, those kinds of things,
the resort to violence and the misinterpretation
of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes,
of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause
that I need not mention, and that is that in general,
men don't give a damn. (Applause)
That's true. The average man that might say,
I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged
position that we occupy, and this is very similar
to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination, legally,
had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War
Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time,
there were many white people that didn't think that
racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges
of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing
that exists today, because the average man
really doesn't care. Even though they say, "I'm against
discrimination against girls and women," they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get
the majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control
the military system, the majority of men that control
the governments of the world, and the majority of men that control
the great religions. So what is the basic thing
that we need to do today? I would say the best thing
that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence
and who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility
on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination
against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say
about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down
to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here 
will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses
and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters
and your granddaughters. I have 12 grandchildren,
four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they
will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt
or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women
and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much. (Applause)

to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem.
It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist,
a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach
Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention
in the year 2000 decided that women should play
a secondary position, a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests,
pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't
teach a man, and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures
are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer,
for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women
are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? Why should I pay them equal pay
for doing the same kind of work? The other very serious blight that causes this problem
is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing
tremendously around the world. In the United States of America,
for instance, we have had an enormous increase
in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities,
by putting them in prison. When I was in office
as governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans
were in prison. Nowadays, 7.3 people
per 1,000 are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase
in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have
[one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty
that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside
the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights
in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now,
and I figured out the other day that California has spent
four billion dollars in convicting 13 people
for the death penalty. If you add that up, that's 307 million
dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law
abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much. (Applause) So the resort to violence and abuse
of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase
in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few
abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
a limited amount of time, as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible
and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl,
very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away
by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and,
in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts
of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes, in more extreme cases
but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl
can just urinate or menstruate. And then later, when she gets married,
the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up
so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing, although
it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females
that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries,
it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way
before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing
is honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation,
again, of a holy scripture -- there's nothing in the Quran
that mandates this -- will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man
that her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she
wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members
of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings
so-called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt
not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent
of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father,
the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders
are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women
particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about 12.5 million people
sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in
the 19th century and the 18th century. There are 30 million people
now living in slavery. The United States Department of State
now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports
that 800,000 people are sold across international borders
every year into slavery, and that 80 percent
of those sold are women, into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living
in human bondage, or slavery. Atlanta, Georgia, where
the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women,
people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place
in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest
airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers
that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl
that has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars. A white-skinned girl brings
several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia. So this is another very serious problem,
and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not
a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief
of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one
of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought
increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps
and the male customers are prosecuted, and -- (Applause) --
prostitution has gone down. In the United States, we take
just the opposite position. For every male arrested
for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested
in the United States of America. Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now
towards this so-called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions
in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great
university system. In the military, they are now analyzing
how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got,
there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000. Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding
officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine,
or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer
has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want
is for anybody to know that under their command,
sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls
who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted
before she graduates, and this is now getting
a lot of publicity, partially because of my book,
but other things, and so 89 universities in America
are now condemned by the Department of Education
under Title IX because the officials of the universities
are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says
that more than half of the rapes on a college campus
take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody,
they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus,
they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things
that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious
about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know. (Applause) And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now
gets 23 percent less than a man. When I became president,
the difference was 39 percent. So we've made some progress,
partially because I was president and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) -- but in the last 15 years,
there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23
or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well, that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike
nation on Earth. We have been to war
with about 25 different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes, we've had soldiers
on the ground fighting. The other times,
we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times, of course, now, we have
drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war
with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years,
I won't say which ones, where we didn't -- (Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway, those kinds of things,
the resort to violence and the misinterpretation
of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes,
of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause
that I need not mention, and that is that in general,
men don't give a damn. (Applause)
That's true. The average man that might say,
I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged
position that we occupy, and this is very similar
to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination, legally,
had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War
Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time,
there were many white people that didn't think that
racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges
of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing
that exists today, because the average man
really doesn't care. Even though they say, "I'm against
discrimination against girls and women," they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get
the majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control
the military system, the majority of men that control
the governments of the world, and the majority of men that control
the great religions. So what is the basic thing
that we need to do today? I would say the best thing
that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence
and who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility
on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination
against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say
about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down
to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here 
will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses
and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters
and your granddaughters. I have 12 grandchildren,
four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they
will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt
or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women
and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your

the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough

the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen
it? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back
in time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer
Scotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that
it makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff
is not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and
it pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials
that seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing
concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable

concrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials
in the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like
solids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid
in place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has
been replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert
and sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps
its dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like
silicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures
and pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical
fluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift
out of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,
lightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because
the air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit
and spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which
means we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are
you’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things
invisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak
technology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating
flexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very
thin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has
to bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped
gold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,
any light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding
the fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold
antennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic
level right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can
make larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,
but what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your
average raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic
the waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough
surfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize
the interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have
things like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are
covered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,
thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water
droplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical
devices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used
to keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to
make a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,
if you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material
we know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular
structure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms
an exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but
it’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked
diamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme
heat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial
jobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful
than regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure
changes that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,
also known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,
the atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,
which makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms
are in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,
before its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,
the malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low
stiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than
other forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used
as coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like
golf club heads. But eventually the material could be used
to easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger
car parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like
aluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep
many of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting
electricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different
ways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of
gas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the
gas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little
bubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful
for building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech
shock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they
can absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability
of a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential
for building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like
aluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent
aluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing
is really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material
starts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline
structure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely
strong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging
from bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully
we’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re
familiar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in
fact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete
hopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from
one end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of
its strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings
or roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels
and walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to
pour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical
yet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing
sidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan
of concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,
the basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that
can create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks
and expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more
damage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable
capsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping
in dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing
calcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years
if there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very
small cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge
for fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of
new materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all
these technologies, and more. Someday, Scotty will have been proven right! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
So say you just moved from England to the US and you've got your old school supplies from England and your new school supplies from the US and it's your first day of school and you get to class and find that your new American paper doesn't fit in your old English binder. The paper is too wide, and hangs out. So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper. And to keep yourself amused during your math class you start playing with them. And by you, I mean Arthur H. Stone in 1939. Anyway, there's lots of cool things you can do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into shapes. And more shapes. Maybe spiral it around snugly like this. Maybe make it into a square. Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts. In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip, and then your hexagon is pretty stable. And you're like, "I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting, but I guess it has symmetry or something." Maybe you could kinda fold it so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up. That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles, which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are, you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little bit during your class. And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry, you decide to try this three-way fold the other way, with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up. What? You close it back up and undo it. Everything seems the same as before, the center is not open-uppable. But when you fold it that way again, it, like, flips inside-out. Weird. This time, instead of going backwards, you try doing it again. And again. And again. And again. And you want to make one that's a little less messy, so you try again with another strip and tape it nicely into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide that it would be cool to color the sides, so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow. Now you can flip from yellow side to white side. Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go? So you go back, and this time you color the white side green, and find that your paper has three sides. Yellow, white, and green. Now this thing is definitely cool. Therefore, you need to name it. And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is. That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking about hexaflexagons. And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class you pull out your paper strips. You had made this sort of spirally folded paper that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper, and you decide to take that And use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon. Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier with the extra paper. And you color the three sides and are like, Orange, yellow, pink. And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class. Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second. Okay, so you color that one green. And now it's orange, yellow, green. Orange, yellow, green. Who knows where the pink side went? Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh. With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way, flappy way up. But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways. Yes, one goes from pink to blue, but the other, from pink to orange. And now, one way goes from orange to yellow, but the other way goes from orange to...neon yellow. During lunch you want to show this off to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman. You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon, which you call the trihexaflexagon. And he's like, whoa! and wants to learn how to make one. And you're like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip, fold it into equilateral triangles, and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric. The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not, then you're doing it wrong. And then you just tape the first triangle to the last along the edge, and you're good. But Tuckerman doesn't have tape. After all, it was invented only 10 years ago. So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine, and then glues the first to the last. Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it flat and trianglly, and then opening from the center. You decide to start a flexagon commitee together to explore the mysteries of flexagation. But that will have to wait until next time.

And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is. That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking about hexaflexagons. And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class you pull out your paper strips. You had made this sort of spirally folded paper that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper, and you decide to take that And use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon. Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier with the extra paper. And you color the three sides and are like, Orange, yellow, pink. And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class. Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second. Okay, so you color that one green. And now it's orange, yellow, green. Orange, yellow, green. Who knows where the pink side went? Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh. With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way, flappy way up. But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways. Yes, one goes from pink to blue, but the other, from pink to orange. And now, one way goes from orange to yellow, but the other way goes from orange to...neon yellow. During lunch you want to show this off to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman. You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon, which you call the trihexaflexagon. And he's like, whoa! and wants to learn how to make one. And you're like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip, fold it into equilateral triangles, and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric. The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not, then you're doing it wrong. And then you just tape the first triangle to the last along the edge, and you're good. But Tuckerman doesn't have tape. After all, it was invented only 10 years ago. So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine, and then glues the first to the last. Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it flat and trianglly, and then opening from the center. You decide to start a flexagon commitee together to explore the mysteries of flexagation. But that will have to wait until next time.

**Transcript**:
So say you just moved from England to the US and you've got your old school supplies from England and your new school supplies from the US and it's your first day of school and you get to class and find that your new American paper doesn't fit in your old English binder. The paper is too wide, and hangs out. So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper. And to keep yourself amused during your math class you start playing with them. And by you, I mean Arthur H. Stone in 1939. Anyway, there's lots of cool things you can do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into shapes. And more shapes. Maybe spiral it around snugly like this. Maybe make it into a square. Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts. In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip, and then your hexagon is pretty stable. And you're like, "I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting, but I guess it has symmetry or something." Maybe you could kinda fold it so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up. That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles, which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are, you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little bit during your class. And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry, you decide to try this three-way fold the other way, with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up. What? You close it back up and undo it. Everything seems the same as before, the center is not open-uppable. But when you fold it that way again, it, like, flips inside-out. Weird. This time, instead of going backwards, you try doing it again. And again. And again. And again. And you want to make one that's a little less messy, so you try again with another strip and tape it nicely into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide that it would be cool to color the sides, so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow. Now you can flip from yellow side to white side. Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go? So you go back, and this time you color the white side green, and find that your paper has three sides. Yellow, white, and green. Now this thing is definitely cool. Therefore, you need to name it.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?

have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song

to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than

**Transcript**:
Translator: Leslie Gauthier
Reviewer: Camille Martínez I want you to look
around the room for a minute and try to find the most
paranoid person here -- (Laughter) And then I want you to point
at that person for me. (Laughter) OK, don't actually do it. (Laughter) But, as an organizational psychologist, I spend a lot of time in workplaces, and I find paranoia everywhere. Paranoia is caused by people
that I call "takers." Takers are self-serving
in their interactions. It's all about what can you do for me. The opposite is a giver. It's somebody who approaches
most interactions by asking, "What can I do for you?" I wanted to give you a chance
to think about your own style. We all have moments of giving and taking. Your style is how you treat
most of the people most of the time, your default. I have a short test you can take to figure out if you're more
of a giver or a taker, and you can take it right now. [The Narcissist Test] [Step 1: Take a moment
to think about yourself.] (Laughter) [Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,
you are not a narcissist.] (Laughter) This is the only thing I will say today
that has no data behind it, but I am convinced the longer it takes
for you to laugh at this cartoon, the more worried we should be
that you're a taker. (Laughter) Of course, not all takers are narcissists. Some are just givers who got burned
one too many times. Then there's another kind of taker
that we won't be addressing today, and that's called a psychopath. (Laughter) I was curious, though, about how
common these extremes are, and so I surveyed over 30,000
people across industries around the world's cultures. And I found that most people
are right in the middle between giving and taking. They choose this third style
called "matching." If you're a matcher, you try to keep
an even balance of give and take: quid pro quo -- I'll do something
for you if you do something for me. And that seems like a safe way
to live your life. But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life? The answer to that question
is a very definitive ... maybe. (Laughter) I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring
their productivity. (Laughter) I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue. (Laughter) And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers. The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors
than they got back. They were so busy doing
other people's jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed. In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students who agree most strongly
with statements like, "I love helping others," which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody. (Laughter) And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople. I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score. And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --" I didn't ask it that way, but -- (Laughter) "What's the cost of generosity in sales?" And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products." (Laughter) So just out of curiosity, how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers? Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data. But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here, because givers are often
sacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better. We have a huge body of evidence -- many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team
or an organization -- and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure: higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention -- even lower operating expenses. So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way. I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed. So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers, who are the best performers? Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers. Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers. If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world. And so when you meet a taker, you feel like it's your mission in life to just punish the hell
out of that person. (Laughter) And that way justice gets served. Well, most people are matchers. And that means if you're a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually; what goes around will come around. And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers
who are the best performers. But they're not. In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied, the best results belong
to the givers again. Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue. What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes. They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue. The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity and medical students' grades. Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Which raises the question: How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel? I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools -- even governments. Are you ready? (Cheers) I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm. (Laughter) The first thing that's really critical is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people, but if they're not careful, they burn out. So you have to protect
the givers in your midst. And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker. It's the guy, not the cat. (Laughter) His name is Adam Rifkin. He's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people. And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor. Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver. You just have to find small ways
to add large value to other people's lives." That could be as simple
as making an introduction between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other. It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback. Or It might be even something
as basic as saying, "You know, I'm going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed." And those five-minute favors
are really critical to helping givers set boundaries
and protect themselves. The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture
where givers succeed, is you actually need a culture
where help-seeking is the norm; where people ask a lot. This may hit a little too close
to home for some of you. [So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?] (Laughter) What you see with successful givers is they recognize that it's OK
to be a receiver, too. If you run an organization,
we can actually make this easier. We can make it easier
for people to ask for help. A couple colleagues and I
studied hospitals. We found that on certain floors,
nurses did a lot of help-seeking, and on other floors,
they did very little of it. The factor that stood out on the floors
where help-seeking was common, where it was the norm, was there was just one nurse
whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit. When that role was available, nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,
it's not vulnerable to ask for help -- it's actually encouraged." Help-seeking isn't important
just for protecting the success and the well-being of givers. It's also critical to getting
more people to act like givers, because the data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
of all giving in organizations starts with a request. But a lot of people don't ask. They don't want to look incompetent, they don't know where to turn,
they don't want to burden others. Yet if nobody ever asks for help, you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization who would love to step up and contribute, if they only knew
who could benefit and how. But I think the most important thing, if you want to build a culture
of successful givers, is to be thoughtful about who
you let onto your team. I figured, you want a culture
of productive generosity, you should hire a bunch of givers. But I was surprised to discover, actually,
that that was not right -- that the negative impact
of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple
the positive impact of a giver. Think about it this way: one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg
just does not make a dozen. I don't know what that means -- (Laughter) But I hope you do. No -- let even one taker into a team, and you will see that the givers
will stop helping. They'll say, "I'm surrounded
by a bunch of snakes and sharks. Why should I contribute?" Whereas if you let one giver into a team, you don't get an explosion of generosity. More often, people are like, "Great! That person can do all our work." So, effective hiring and screening
and team building is not about bringing in the givers; it's about weeding out the takers. If you can do that well, you'll be left with givers and matchers. The givers will be generous because they don't have to worry
about the consequences. And the beauty of the matchers
is that they follow the norm. So how do you catch a taker
before it's too late? We're actually pretty bad
at figuring out who's a taker, especially on first impressions. There's a personality trait
that throws us off. It's called agreeableness, one the major dimensions
of personality across cultures. Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
they're nice, they're polite. You find a lot of them in Canada -- (Laughter) Where there was actually
a national contest to come up with a new Canadian slogan
and fill in the blank, "As Canadian as ..." I thought the winning entry
was going to be, "As Canadian as maple syrup,"
or, "... ice hockey." But no, Canadians voted
for their new national slogan to be -- I kid you not -- "As Canadian as possible
under the circumstances." (Laughter) Now for those of you
who are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away. How could I ever say I'm any one thing when I'm constantly adapting
to try to please other people? Disagreeable people do less of it. They're more critical,
skeptical, challenging, and far more likely than their peers
to go to law school. (Laughter) That's not a joke,
that's actually an empirical fact. (Laughter) So I always assumed
that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers. But then I gathered the data, and I was stunned to find
no correlation between those traits, because it turns out
that agreeableness-disagreeableness is your outer veneer: How pleasant is it to interact with you? Whereas giving and taking
are more of your inner motives: What are your values?
What are your intentions toward others? If you really want to judge
people accurately, you have to get to the moment every
consultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two-by-two. (Laughter) The agreeable givers are easy to spot: they say yes to everything. The disagreeable takers
are also recognized quickly, although you might call them
by a slightly different name. (Laughter) We forget about the other
two combinations. There are disagreeable givers
in our organizations. There are people who are gruff
and tough on the surface but underneath have
others' best interests at heart. Or as an engineer put it, "Oh, disagreeable givers -- like somebody with a bad user interface
but a great operating system." (Laughter) If that helps you. (Laughter) Disagreeable givers are the most
undervalued people in our organizations, because they're the ones
who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear
but everyone needs to hear. We need to do a much better job
valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early, and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly, must be a selfish taker." The other combination we forget about
is the deadly one -- the agreeable taker,
also known as the faker. This is the person
who's nice to your face, and then will stab you right in the back. (Laughter) And my favorite way to catch
these people in the interview process is to ask the question, "Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have
fundamentally improved?" The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more
influential than them, because takers are great at kissing up
and then kicking down. Givers are more likely to name people
who are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good. And let's face it, you all know
you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone
treats their restaurant server or their Uber driver. So if we do all this well, if we can weed takers
out of organizations, if we can make it safe to ask for help, if we can protect givers from burnout and make it OK for them to be ambitious
in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people, we can actually change the way
that people define success. Instead of saying it's all about
winning a competition, people will realize success
is really more about contribution. I believe that the most
meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed. And if we can spread that belief, we can actually turn paranoia upside down. There's a name for that. It's called "pronoia." Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people
are plotting your well-being. (Laughter) That they're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally
glowing things about you. The great thing about a culture of givers
is that's not a delusion -- it's reality. I want to live in a world
where givers succeed, and I hope you will help me
create that world. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Translator: Leslie Gauthier
Reviewer: Camille Martínez I want you to look
around the room for a minute and try to find the most
paranoid person here -- (Laughter) And then I want you to point
at that person for me. (Laughter) OK, don't actually do it. (Laughter) But, as an organizational psychologist, I spend a lot of time in workplaces, and I find paranoia everywhere. Paranoia is caused by people
that I call "takers." Takers are self-serving
in their interactions. It's all about what can you do for me. The opposite is a giver. It's somebody who approaches
most interactions by asking, "What can I do for you?" I wanted to give you a chance
to think about your own style. We all have moments of giving and taking. Your style is how you treat
most of the people most of the time, your default. I have a short test you can take to figure out if you're more
of a giver or a taker, and you can take it right now. [The Narcissist Test] [Step 1: Take a moment
to think about yourself.] (Laughter) [Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,
you are not a narcissist.] (Laughter) This is the only thing I will say today
that has no data behind it, but I am convinced the longer it takes
for you to laugh at this cartoon, the more worried we should be
that you're a taker. (Laughter) Of course, not all takers are narcissists. Some are just givers who got burned
one too many times. Then there's another kind of taker
that we won't be addressing today, and that's called a psychopath. (Laughter) I was curious, though, about how
common these extremes are, and so I surveyed over 30,000
people across industries around the world's cultures. And I found that most people
are right in the middle between giving and taking. They choose this third style
called "matching." If you're a matcher, you try to keep
an even balance of give and take: quid pro quo -- I'll do something
for you if you do something for me. And that seems like a safe way
to live your life. But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life? The answer to that question
is a very definitive ... maybe. (Laughter) I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring
their productivity. (Laughter) I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue. (Laughter) And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers. The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors
than they got back. They were so busy doing
other people's jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed. In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students who agree most strongly
with statements like, "I love helping others," which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody. (Laughter) And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople. I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score. And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --" I didn't ask it that way, but -- (Laughter) "What's the cost of generosity in sales?" And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products." (Laughter) So just out of curiosity, how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers? Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data. But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here, because givers are often
sacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better. We have a huge body of evidence -- many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team
or an organization -- and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure: higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention -- even lower operating expenses. So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way. I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed. So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers, who are the best performers? Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers. Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers. If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world. And so when you meet a taker, you feel like it's your mission in life to just punish the hell
out of that person. (Laughter) And that way justice gets served. Well, most people are matchers. And that means if you're a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually; what goes around will come around. And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers
who are the best performers. But they're not. In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied, the best results belong
to the givers again. Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue. What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes. They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue. The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity and medical students' grades. Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Which raises the question: How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel? I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools -- even governments. Are you ready? (Cheers) I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm. (Laughter) The first thing that's really critical is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people, but if they're not careful, they burn out. So you have to protect
the givers in your midst. And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker. It's the guy, not the cat. (Laughter) His name is Adam Rifkin. He's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people. And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor. Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver. You just have to find small ways
to add large value to other people's lives." That could be as simple
as making an introduction between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other. It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback. Or It might be even something
as basic as saying, "You know, I'm going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed." And those five-minute favors

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When the Wright brothers
had to decide who would be the first to 
fly their new airplane off a sand dune, 
they flipped a coin. That was fair: we all know there’s an equal chance 
of getting heads and tails. But what if they had 
a more complicated contest? What if they flipped coins repeatedly, so that Orville would win as soon as 
two heads showed up in a row on his coin, and Wilbur would win as soon as heads 
was immediately followed by tails on his? Would each brother still have had an equal
chance to be the first in flight? At first, it may seem they’d still have 
the same chance of winning. There are four combinations
for two consecutive flips. And if you do flip a coin just twice, there’s an equal chance 
of each one -- 25%. So your intuition might tell you 
that in any string of coin flips, each combination would have 
the same shot at appearing first. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Wilbur actually has
a big advantage in this contest. Imagine our sequence of coin flips 
as a sort of board game, where every flip determines which
path we take. The goal is to get from start to finish. The heads/tails board looks like this. And this is the head/head board. There’s one critical difference. Heads/heads has a move that sends you 
all the way back to the start that heads/tails doesn’t have. That’s why heads/heads
takes longer on average. So we can demonstrate that this is true
using probability and algebra to calculate the average number of flips
it would take to get each combination. Let’s start with the heads/tails board, and define x to be the average 
number of flips to advance one step. Focus only on the arrows. It has two identical steps, each with a 50/50 chance of staying 
in place or moving forward. Option 1: If we stay in place by getting 
tails, we waste one flip. Since we’re back in the same place, on average we must flip x more times 
to advance one step. Together with that first flip, this gives an average of x + 1 
total flips to advance. Option 2: If we get heads 
and move forward, then we have taken exactly one total flip 
to advance one step. We can now combine option 1 
and option 2 with their probabilities to get this expression. Solving that for x gives us an average 
of two moves to advance one step. Since each step is identical, we can multiply by two and arrive
at four flips to advance two steps. For heads/heads, 
the picture isn’t as simple. This time, let y be the average number 
of flips to move from start to finish. There are two options for the first move, 
each with 50/50 odds. Option 1 is the same as before, getting tails sends us back to the start, giving an average 
of y+1 total flips to finish. In Option 2, there are two equally 
likely cases for the next flip. With heads we’d be done after two flips. But tails would return us to the start. Since we’d return after two flips, we’d then need an average
of y+2 flips in total to finish. So our full expression will be this. And solving this equation

average of six flips to get heads/heads, and an average of four 
to get heads/tails. And, in fact, that’s what you’d see if you

**Transcript**:
When the Wright brothers
had to decide who would be the first to 
fly their new airplane off a sand dune, 
they flipped a coin. That was fair: we all know there’s an equal chance 
of getting heads and tails. But what if they had 
a more complicated contest? What if they flipped coins repeatedly, so that Orville would win as soon as 
two heads showed up in a row on his coin, and Wilbur would win as soon as heads 
was immediately followed by tails on his? Would each brother still have had an equal
chance to be the first in flight? At first, it may seem they’d still have 
the same chance of winning. There are four combinations
for two consecutive flips. And if you do flip a coin just twice, there’s an equal chance 
of each one -- 25%. So your intuition might tell you 
that in any string of coin flips, each combination would have 
the same shot at appearing first. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Wilbur actually has
a big advantage in this contest. Imagine our sequence of coin flips 
as a sort of board game, where every flip determines which
path we take. The goal is to get from start to finish. The heads/tails board looks like this. And this is the head/head board. There’s one critical difference. Heads/heads has a move that sends you 
all the way back to the start that heads/tails doesn’t have. That’s why heads/heads
takes longer on average. So we can demonstrate that this is true
using probability and algebra to calculate the average number of flips
it would take to get each combination. Let’s start with the heads/tails board, and define x to be the average 
number of flips to advance one step. Focus only on the arrows. It has two identical steps, each with a 50/50 chance of staying 
in place or moving forward. Option 1: If we stay in place by getting 
tails, we waste one flip. Since we’re back in the same place, on average we must flip x more times 
to advance one step. Together with that first flip, this gives an average of x + 1 
total flips to advance. Option 2: If we get heads 
and move forward, then we have taken exactly one total flip 
to advance one step. We can now combine option 1 
and option 2 with their probabilities to get this expression. Solving that for x gives us an average 
of two moves to advance one step. Since each step is identical, we can multiply by two and arrive
at four flips to advance two steps. For heads/heads, 
the picture isn’t as simple. This time, let y be the average number 
of flips to move from start to finish. There are two options for the first move, 
each with 50/50 odds. Option 1 is the same as before, getting tails sends us back to the start, giving an average 
of y+1 total flips to finish. In Option 2, there are two equally 
likely cases for the next flip. With heads we’d be done after two flips. But tails would return us to the start. Since we’d return after two flips, we’d then need an average
of y+2 flips in total to finish. So our full expression will be this. And solving this equation 
gives us six flips. So the math calculates that it takes an
average of six flips to get heads/heads, and an average of four 
to get heads/tails. And, in fact, that’s what you’d see if you
tested it for yourself enough times. Of course, the Wright brothers didn’t

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try? Turns out there are. Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go? We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality it consists mostly of empty space With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years So our galaxy is... pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it's part of the "local group" a region of space about ten million light years in diameter It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster. Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics. In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening. Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the smallest scale, there is constant action. Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions. Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well, and subatomic distances became galactic distances. With dense, and less dense regions. After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together. At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious. So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe... grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait, what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here, dark energy makes everything complicated. About six billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly. In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group... that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away. But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match. We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded, the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years. But it becomes even more depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away... that they will be too faint to detect ... and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions, forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe! When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing what we know today. The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end. They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System... and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time, to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated and remote as the Local Group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now. Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.

It's awesome that you watched this far, so we've made a playlist for you about more universe stuff.
