Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question is about declarative memory, which is the type of memory mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. Although the options are not identical, the question content and intent are similar, as both questions aim to assess the understanding of declarative memory.

However, a more precise match would be a question that directly asks about the type of memory used to remember a specific piece of information, such as a home address. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, Question 3 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match. If I had to choose an index, I would say 3.

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So in one of the last episodes, I introduced you to a legend with a longbow. He's from my hometown and his name is Byron Ferguson. He shot an aspirin out of the air in slow-motion. But there's something that happened in the arrow I didn't understand. It was deflecting and it has something to do with what's called the "archer's paradox". What do you think, Byron? - "The archer's paradox is the demon for all archers, but there are ways to work around it." Not bad! Alright, so today on Smarter Every Day, we're gonna understand how an arrow deflects and what's called the "archer's paradox". A paradox is a situation involving two things with a contradictory nature. So what is the archer's paradox? What are the two things an archer has to deconflict? My friend John explained it to me like this. Let's pretend that this pecan tree is the bow and this is the line of our bowstring. If we take an arrow and we put it into our bow and we draw the bow back, and we're trying to hit that target over there, watch what happens. As we release the bowstring and it travels closer to the bow - look at that -, the fact that the bow is sitting here in our way between us and the target, causes the arrow to point off in a different direction. So how can we possibly hit that target, when our arrow is pointed over there? This is the archer's paradox, because we know they actually do hit targets like that. Toy designers are cheaters: they don't deal with the paradox, they just get around it. For example, the guy who designed this suction cup bow, he doesn't go around the handle, straight through the middle. Check that out! Whoever designed this crossbow, instead of being in line with the bow itself, the string is offset by this big rail. That way, the string is always pushing along the dart. So how does a longbow shooter get around this problem? Here's how: they don't have a completely rigid arrow like that, they have a bendable arrow like this. See when it vibrates? You can see these nodal points? That's important. Check this out. As we put this real arrow into the bow here and we shoot, as we go towards the bow, the fact that we're accelerating this arrow causes it to build strain energy, causing this big curvature. That curvature then snaps back in the other direction once it bends to a certain point and look what we have. We have the arrow bending around the bow. When we release, it does something cool. It snakes around the bow, just like this and you're able to fly all the way to the target. So the archer's paradox is the fact that you have a bow in between you and the target and you're still able to get around the bow. "The first that happens, is the arrow bends from the pressure of the string and the front arrow being against the riser of the bow. As it leaves the bow, or has already cleared the bow, it bends in the opposite direction. When those two cross, determines where the arrow will fly. One hundred percent of the time, the arrow will fly where these two points are crossed, are pointed. Whereas if this one had been here, then the arrow's gonna fly to the left. If it was here, the arrow flies off to the right. We want those two lined up to go straight to the target." - "Gotcha. So the fact that it bends, helps it get around the arrow rest without going off in an angle, as if it were a straight line." - "Correct." - "You're pushing the string straight towards the handle, but somehow it makes it around the handle." - "Right." - "Yeah, and the bends is how it does that?" - "That's correct." Alright, my buddy Sander actually shoots with a compound bow. You don't do any of that longbow stuff, right? - "I have one, but I'm not really good at it." - "Alright, so what's the deal here?" - "So a compound, there's a whole lot more going on on a compound. There are more things that can go wrong, too, but there are several advantages if they're working." - "Yeah." - "So a compound, you see that's it cut out in the middle, you get this -" - "Oh, so the riser's not stout, is that what you're saying?" - "Yes, so the arrow is travelling straight, it doesn't have to go around a riser." - "Okay." - "And many people shoot also a drop-away rest, so it's gonna drop down. Whenever you pull the  bow back. a string attached to one of the bowstrings, pulls the rest up -" - "Nice!" "- centers your arrow, if you have it lined all up and square, your arrow is nice and level and then when you shoot, that arrow would dr- the rest would drop away -" - "Well, shoot it, shoot it. Let's do it. Oh no, wait, let me zoom in." "Hold on, so I'm looking at that rest, it's gonna fall away, right? - "Real fast!" - "Okay I'm ready. Dude, that is super fast. So is the arrow touching the rest as it goes through?" - "A little bit." - "Really?" - "'Cause it drops but it's not, I mean, immediate, it's down before the arrow passes it." - "So the goal here is, you don't have to bend around the riser, but I bet the arrow still bends, though?" - "It does bend and that's actually important in the straightness of the arrow flight." Isn't that interesting?But something else is going on here. Byron Ferguson is able to predict the wobbling of that arrow so good, that he's able to hit an aspirin tablet with a vibrating arrow, just like that. So one of two things is going on. Either a) he knows some science that we don't; or b) he's a warlock and this is all black magic. - "Okay, the stiffness of an arrow is called the spine, right? And so the spine is what, Byron?" - "The stiffness of the arrow." - "Oh, right! So this is your spine tester?" - "This is the spine tester, set up right now to test the flexion of a carbon arrow." - "Okay." - "So we actually have a two pound weight and the arrow's suspended at 26 inches. That's for carbon." - "Okay." - "And we read the inside of the scale here, to see how much it deflects." - "So you, you test all of your arrows before you shoot, so that you can normalize the paradox?" - "Correct, I want all the arrows to have the same stiffness." - "And that's how you're able to hit things like an aspirin?" - "That's part of it, yes." -"There's a little bit of skill. If it's out of tolerance, you just don't even put it in your quiver?" - "That's what those are." - "Really? Really? You've just a got a box of stuff that you don't shoot?" - "Yeah, they're too far out of tolerance." - "Really? That's amazing. So, people were asking in the last video - that arrow was deflecting so much -, they're saying "How do you time that?" and the way you time that, is you know the exact spine of the arrow." - "Correct." - "That's awesome. This is pretty good information.So this isn't black magic, this is science?" - "Correct." - "That's awesome." Byron is using science to normalize the wobble of his arrows. But less it been, there's a little bit of wizardry here, right? Because of the certain distance from his bow, he still has to know which side of the arrow that wobble's gonna be on. And then he has to line that up with an aspirin tablet. So this is a pretty good shot. In order to fully appreciate this trick shot, I'm gonna do a trick shot of my own, using the Phantom Miro. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, it was sponsored by Harrys.com. Harry's makes subscription razors, that are really high-quality. They end up being about the same price the old razors I used to use So, I have no need for my old razors, so Byron's gonna help me get rid of it. If you're interested in getting a Harry's razor - I actually shaved with one today -, go to Harrys.com and use the promocode "Smarter". - "What are you gonna try?" - "I'm gonna try to hit it down in here, around the neck part." - "Get it of it that way?" - "Cut its head off." - "Excellent. Alright, I'm gonna film this with the Phantom v711. I hope you hit it, this would be awesome! You did it! Like, I thought you would do it, but you did it! That's the first shot, Byron!" - "Luckily!" - "Whatever, man!" Alright, there you go. So, if you want to support Smarter Every Day, go to Harrys.com, use the promocode "Smarter", get you a discount on some razors. Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day, please considering subscribing and thank you as always, Byron. - "Can I get some Harry's razors, too?" - "You can!" I'm Destin, you get smarter every day, have a good one - he actually that! BEEP - "You make your own arrowheads, right?" - "Uh no, I designed the head, it's actually made in Austria. This is what called a destructive test." - "Holy cow, it didn't break, man! It didn't break! It didn't break! - "Did you think it would do that?" - "I was hoping for it."

As it leaves the bow, or has already cleared the bow, it bends in the opposite direction. When those two cross, determines where the arrow will fly. One hundred percent of the time, the arrow will fly where these two points are crossed, are pointed. Whereas if this one had been here, then the arrow's gonna fly to the left. If it was here, the arrow flies off to the right. We want those two lined up to go straight to the target." - "Gotcha. So the fact that it bends, helps it get around the arrow rest without going off in an angle, as if it were a straight line." - "Correct." - "You're pushing the string straight towards the handle, but somehow it makes it around the handle." - "Right." - "Yeah, and the bends is how it does that?" - "That's correct." Alright, my buddy Sander actually shoots with a compound bow. You don't do any of that longbow stuff, right? - "I have one, but I'm not really good at it." - "Alright, so what's the deal here?" - "So a compound, there's a whole lot more going on on a compound. There are more things that can go wrong, too, but there are several advantages if they're working." - "Yeah." - "So a compound, you see that's it cut out in the middle, you get this -" - "Oh, so the riser's not stout, is that what you're saying?" - "Yes, so the arrow is travelling straight, it doesn't have to go around a riser." - "Okay." - "And many people shoot also a drop-away rest, so it's gonna drop down. Whenever you pull the  bow back. a string attached to one of the bowstrings, pulls the rest up -" - "Nice!" "- centers your arrow, if you have it lined all up and square, your arrow is nice and level and then when you shoot, that arrow would dr- the rest would drop away -" - "Well, shoot it, shoot it. Let's do it. Oh no, wait, let me zoom in." "Hold on, so I'm looking at that rest, it's gonna fall away, right? - "Real fast!" - "Okay I'm ready. Dude, that is super fast. So is the arrow touching the rest as it goes through?" - "A little bit." - "Really?" - "'Cause it drops but it's not, I mean, immediate, it's down before the arrow passes it." - "So the goal here is, you don't have to bend around the riser, but I bet the arrow still bends, though?" - "It does bend and that's actually important in the straightness of the arrow flight." Isn't that interesting?But something else is going on here. Byron Ferguson is able to predict the wobbling of that arrow so good, that he's able to hit an aspirin tablet with a vibrating arrow, just like that. So one of two things is going on. Either a) he knows some science that we don't; or b) he's a warlock and this is all black magic. - "Okay, the stiffness of an arrow is called the spine, right? And so the spine is what, Byron?" - "The stiffness of the arrow." - "Oh, right! So this is your spine tester?" - "This is the spine tester, set up right now to test the flexion of a carbon arrow." - "Okay." - "So we actually have a two pound weight and the arrow's suspended at 26 inches. That's for carbon." - "Okay." - "And we read the inside of the scale here, to see how much it deflects." - "So you, you test all of your arrows before you shoot, so that you can normalize the paradox?" - "Correct, I want all the arrows to have the same stiffness." - "And that's how you're able to hit things like an aspirin?" - "That's part of it, yes." -"There's a little bit of skill. If it's out of tolerance, you just don't even put it in your quiver?" - "That's what those are." - "Really? Really? You've just a got a box of stuff that you don't shoot?" - "Yeah, they're too far out of tolerance." - "Really? That's amazing. So, people were asking in the last video - that arrow was deflecting so much -, they're saying "How do you time that?" and the way you time that, is you know the exact spine of the arrow." - "Correct." - "That's awesome. This is pretty good information.So this isn't black magic, this is science?" - "Correct." - "That's awesome." Byron is using science to normalize the wobble of his arrows. But less it been, there's a little bit of wizardry here, right? Because of the certain distance from his bow, he still has to know which side of the arrow that wobble's gonna be on. And then he has to line that up with an aspirin tablet. So this is a pretty good shot. In order to fully appreciate this trick shot, I'm gonna do a trick shot of my own, using the Phantom Miro. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, it was sponsored by Harrys.com. Harry's makes subscription razors, that are really high-quality. They end up being about the same price the old razors I used to use So, I have no need for my old razors, so Byron's gonna help me get rid of it. If you're interested in getting a Harry's razor - I actually shaved with one today -, go to Harrys.com and use the promocode "Smarter". - "What are you gonna try?" - "I'm gonna try to hit it down in here, around the neck part." - "Get it of it that way?" - "Cut its head off." - "Excellent. Alright, I'm gonna film this with the Phantom v711. I hope you hit it, this would be awesome! You did it! Like, I thought you would do it, but you did it! That's the first shot, Byron!" - "Luckily!" - "Whatever, man!" Alright, there you go.

**Transcript**:
There are no blue tigers. No blue bats, no blue squirrels, or blue dogs. Even blue whales aren’t that blue. Animals come in pretty much every color, but
blue seems to be the rarest. What’s cool, though, is when we do find
a blue animal, they’re awesome looking. Nature doesn’t do halfway with blue. To understand why this is, we’re gonna journey
through evolution, chemistry, and some very cool physics. But, first we’re gonna need to understand
why animals are any color at all, and to do that, we need to go look at some butterflies…
because butterflies are awesome… and if you don’t think so, you’re wrong This is Bob Robbins. He’s curator of Lepidoptera at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. Butterflies ARE awesome. Make no mistake about it. They’re a group of moths that evolved to
be active during the day, and if you’re active during the day, you have an advantage:
You can use light to communicate. You probably realize this, but out of all insects, butterflies display the brightest and most detailed patterns. And there’s a good reason for that: The colors in butterfly wings deliver messages,
like “I’m toxic”, or “I’m a male and this is my territory”, but not all butterfly
colors are created equal. If we zoom way in on a butterfly wing, we
see the colors come from tiny scales. It’s actually how moths and butterflies
get their scientific name. Oranges, reds, yellows browns…those scales
all contain pigments, organic molecules that absorb every color except what we see. Black scales absorb all colors. Animals, from butterflies to birds to you
and me, don’t make these pigments from scratch, they’re made from ingredients in our diet. You might know this thanks to flamingos: They’re
born gray, but turn pink thanks to pigments called carotenoids in crustaceans they eat. So when it comes to these colors: You are
what you eat. But not so for blue. Blue is *different* If you move the camera, you can see that the
color changes as you move the camera. It does. It’s like a hologram thing. This is because there’s no blue pigment
in these butterflies Wait… so they’re blue, but they’re not
really blue? That’s correct! Yes. You’re lying to me butterflies! These are Blue Morpho butterflies, maybe the prettiest butterflies of all. I mean… they did make it the butterfly emoji. The blue color isn’t from a pigment. The blue comes from the shape of the wing
scale itself, and when I learned how this works, it kinda blew my mind. If we zoom way in on a blue wing scale, we
see these little ridges. If we slice across the scale, and look closer,
we see those ridges are shaped like tiny Christmas trees. The arrangement of the branches is what gives
Morpho wings their blue color. When light comes in, some bounces off the
top surface. But some light passes into the layer and reflects
off the bottom surface. For most colors of light, waves reflecting
from the top and bottom will be out of phase, they’ll be canceled out, and that light
is removed. But blue light has just the right wavelength:
the reflected light waves are in sync, and that color makes it to our eye. This hall of mirrors only lets blue light
escape. There’s even a pigment at the base that
absorbs stray red and green light to make the blue even more pure. That’s how we get this awesome iridescent
blue. The microscopic structure of the wing itself. All of this happens because of the way light
bends when it moves from air into another material. So if we fill all those tiny gaps with something
other than air, like alcohol, the blue disappears. Technically, this “changes the index of
refraction”, but in plain English that means blue light is no longer bent the right way. The microscopic light filter is broken. Until the alcohol evaporates. And the color returns. But these butterflies live in the rainforest. You think they’d lose their color any time
they got wet, right? Well watch this. These wing scales are made of a material that’s
naturally water-resistant. What about this blue jay feather? If we look through it, the color completely
disappears. No blue pigment. Each feather bristle contains light-scattering
microscopic beads, spaced so everything but blue light is canceled out. Unlike the highly-ordered structures we find
in butterfly wings, these feather structures are more messy, like a foam, so instead of
changing as we move, the color’s more even from every direction. Peacock tail feathers? Again it’s the shape of the feather, not
pigment. But the light reflecting structures here are
more ordered, like a crystal, so it’s brighter from certain angles. There’s even a monkey–WHOA let’s keep
this PG!!–even that color is made by the adding and subtracting of light waves thanks
to structures in the skin… not pigment. And yes, even your blue eyes, are colored
by structures, not pigments. Outside of the ocean, almost exclusively,
the bluest living things make their colors with microscopic structures, and each one’s
a little different. No vertebrate, not a single bird or mammal
or reptile that we know of, makes a blue pigment on its body. In fact, there’s only one known butterfly
that has cracked the code for making a true blue pigment. Blue as a pigment in nature is incredibly
rare. But there’s one exception so far that we
know about, and these are over here called the olivewings. They have evolved a blue pigment. They’re not very common and we don’t know
much about them, and I don’t know of any other blue pigment. That’s a really special butterfly. Why is almost all of nature’s blue made
from structures and not pigments like everything else? I’ve asked this question to several scientists
that study color, and here’s their best theory so far: At some point way back in time,
birds and butterflies evolved the ability to see blue light. But they hadn’t yet evolved a way to paint
their bodies that color. But if they could, it’d be like going from
early Beatles to Sgt. Pepper’s Beatles. it meant new opportunities for communicating
and survival. Creating some blue pigment–out of the blue–would
have required inventing new chemistry, and there was no way to just add that recipe to
their genes. It was much easier for evolution to change
the shape of their bodies, ever so slightly, at the most microscopic level, and create
blue using physics instead. They solved a biology problem with engineering. What I love about this is these colors have
fascinated curious people for hundreds of years. After looking at peacock feathers through
one of the first microscopes back in the 1600’s Robert Hooke wrote:
“these colours are onely fantastical ones” Even Isaac Newton noticed there was something
unusual about these blues, and scientists have been studying it ever since. Not only because the science is interesting,
but because it’s beautiful. Thanks for watching, and stay curious.

you've likely heard about the effects that climate change is having on our planet and specifically in the Arctic which is warming twice as fast but what would actually happen if all the ice melted on Earth I can help with that when you and I drink water we drink nons salty water we drink fresh water now of all the water in the world most of it is salty just 3% is not salty now of that 3% you can't get to most of that because 70% of that 3% is Frozen 30 million cubic kilomet of Frozen water it's so much frozen water so much ice that if you had a layer of it 1,000 M thick it would cover North America that's a lot of Frozen water people on land frozen water forms glaciers ice sheets Perma frost and snow but the Arctic is largely ocean so there it takes the form of floating sea ice like icebergs and because it's in direct contact with warming Waters sea ice will be the the first to melt as global temperatures rise in fact this year NASA reported that the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for January February April May and June 2016 so the world is getting warmer and the ice is melting pretty soon you'll be able to drive your ship from Europe to Russia right over the North Pole with no ice in the way that that's good for certain shipping companies maybe but for the marine species the polar bears the walruses the seals they don't have their old habitats they're all going away they're melting out from under them and ocean dwelling animals like boohead whales and narwhals aren't immune to these changes either as sea ice melts energy and oil companies are taking it as an opportunity to search further north for untapped resources using a process known as seismic blasting they shoot air explosions into the water in an effort to map the ocean floor and find oil of course this has detrimental effects on the whole ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean while also causing physical trauma and habitat relocation in whales in terms of sea levels melting sea ice won't have much of an effect this is because the floating ice already displaces roughly the same amount of water as it would produce when it melts so the net effect would be negligible furthermore the majority of Earth's ice more than 95% is landbased and contained mostly in enormous ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica where there are entire mountain ranges almost as big as the Alps completely buried in ice so what if all the ice on land melts if all this ice melts the ocean's going to have more water in it so the sea levels as measured from the coasts is going to go up it's going to go up 70 M that's a long way people half the world citizens live on sea coasts that's where the uh Commerce action is so they're going to have to move where are they going to go and who's going to pay for it Tokyo New York South par APO Mumbai Shanghai and Jakarta are all Coastal and happen to be some of the world's biggest cities even a small sea level rise of only a couple feet could cause up to a trillion dollar worth of flood damage per year a rise of 10 m would displace more than 630 million people nearly 10% of the world's population at 25 M 1.4 billion people roughly 20% of

Bangladesh and much of northern China and create a new Inland Sea in Australia at the North and South Pole of the earth we have a lot of ice ice is White Ice reflects sunlight into space but there's a feedback mechanism one thing leading to another as the world gets warmer the ice melts as the ice melts it's reflecting less sunlight into space which lets the world get warmer still the sunlight is absorbed by the dark liquid ocean so as the ice melts the world gets warmer and the Sea gets fresher currently the world's oceans are crisscrossed by a set of currents that act like a giant conveyor belt and these currents are powered in part by the differences in the saltiness between one part of the ocean and another so if a melting II in Greenland dumps a whole bunch of non-s salty freshwater into the North Atlantic it's possible that it could disrupt the currents so the conveyor belt takes chemicals takes nutrients around the world which feed Plankton which feed fish which Feed Us half of the oxygen you breathe is made by plants in the ocean so you don't want to mess with this furthermore as that sea surface gets warmer off of Greenland the Gulf Stream will probably shift a little bit and if that shifts what keeps Europe warm right now may not keep Europe as warm so the crops are going to have to be grown grown elsewhere and who's going to grow them and who's going to ship them around and who's going to feed each other and what's going on this is serious business when you go melting the ice we actually went up to the Arctic to see the current state of things firsthand while

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the provided options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the forms that ice takes on land, and the correct answer is "all of the above" (permafrost, glaciers, snow, and ice sheets).

The generated MCQ that is somewhat related to this question is:

Question 2: In the Arctic Ocean, what is the primary form that frozen water takes? Options: A. Glaciers, B. Ice sheets, C. Floating sea ice, D. Permafrost Correct Option: C

However, this question is not about the forms of ice on land, but rather about the primary form of frozen water in the Arctic Ocean.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (with the caveat mentioned above)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ, and it would be ideal to generate a new MCQ that directly addresses the question about the forms of ice on land.

**Transcript**:
you've likely heard about the effects that climate change is having on our planet and specifically in the Arctic which is warming twice as fast but what would actually happen if all the ice melted on Earth I can help with that when you and I drink water we drink nons salty water we drink fresh water now of all the water in the world most of it is salty just 3% is not salty now of that 3% you can't get to most of that because 70% of that 3% is Frozen 30 million cubic kilomet of Frozen water it's so much frozen water so much ice that if you had a layer of it 1,000 M thick it would cover North America that's a lot of Frozen water people on land frozen water forms glaciers ice sheets Perma frost and snow but the Arctic is largely ocean so there it takes the form of floating sea ice like icebergs and because it's in direct contact with warming Waters sea ice will be the the first to melt as global temperatures rise in fact this year NASA reported that the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for January February April May and June 2016 so the world is getting warmer and the ice is melting pretty soon you'll be able to drive your ship from Europe to Russia right over the North Pole with no ice in the way that that's good for certain shipping companies maybe but for the marine species the polar bears the walruses the seals they don't have their old habitats they're all going away they're melting out from under them and ocean dwelling animals like boohead whales and narwhals aren't immune to these changes either as sea ice melts energy and oil companies are taking it as an opportunity to search further north for untapped resources using a process known as seismic blasting they shoot air explosions into the water in an effort to map the ocean floor and find oil of course this has detrimental effects on the whole ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean while also causing physical trauma and habitat relocation in whales in terms of sea levels melting sea ice won't have much of an effect this is because the floating ice already displaces roughly the same amount of water as it would produce when it melts so the net effect would be negligible furthermore the majority of Earth's ice more than 95% is landbased and contained mostly in enormous ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica where there are entire mountain ranges almost as big as the Alps completely buried in ice so what if all the ice on land melts if all this ice melts the ocean's going to have more water in it so the sea levels as measured from the coasts is going to go up it's going to go up 70 M that's a long way people half the world citizens live on sea coasts that's where the uh Commerce action is so they're going to have to move where are they going to go and who's going to pay for it Tokyo New York South par APO Mumbai Shanghai and Jakarta are all Coastal and happen to be some of the world's biggest cities even a small sea level rise of only a couple feet could cause up to a trillion dollar worth of flood damage per year a rise of 10 m would displace more than 630 million people nearly 10% of the world's population at 25 M 1.4 billion people roughly 20% of

**Transcript**:
[ ♪ intro ] Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that writers
give so many superheroes, alien beings, and magical creatures the power of telepathy. Just imagine what you could learn about a
person if you could hear their thoughts. Well, actually, I’ve just made a bit of
an assumption there: that there’d be something to hear. Because not everyone has that kind of internal
monologue—or, what psychologists often  refer to as inner speech. And even people who do hear their thoughts
don’t necessarily talk in their heads 247. It turns out that inner speech could tell
us a lot about how our brains work, how they develop, and how we speak. But… research on all this is really just
getting started. Inner speech is somewhat loosely defined as
when a person “speaks” meaningful thoughts without producing sound or moving any part
of their body, like their tongue or their lips. Though, in some ways, it’s easier to define
by what it isn’t. It’s different from visualizing or picturing
things in your head. And it doesn’t include feelings like happiness
or hunger, or your awareness of sensory experiences, like noticing the glint of something shiny
on the ground. So basically, it only refers to thoughts accompanied
by specific words. These words usually have the same tone, inflection,
and even accent that they would if were spoken aloud—though not always, which we’ll get
to in a bit. Even figuring that much out about inner speech
was somewhat of a challenge for psychologists, because—surprise!—it’s really hard to
measure people’s internal experiences. So there’s been a lot of variation in research
methods, and not a lot of agreement between different studies and different scientists. For example, some studies have tried to see
inside people’s heads by prompting them to hear specific words or phrases in their
mind—like, by asking them to read something silently or determine if two words rhyme without
saying them out loud. That’s revealed some weird quirks about
inner speech—like that, when people read, they’re actually much more likely to mentally
say single words that represent a passage than every word of every sentence. But prompted inner speech and spontaneous
inner speech aren’t really the same. Plus, prompts can't tell us much about how
frequently or why people use inner speech in their daily life. So, some researchers use questionnaires instead. According to those, these conversations we
have with ourselves are generally about... ourselves. And kind of in a bad way. Most of the time, our inner speech consists
of negative things about ourselves, our negative emotions, or us trying to decide if we’re
good enough. And, weirdly enough, that’s all usually
in full sentences. Only about one-third of people experience
abbreviated inner speech, where a single word or phrase represents an entire complex thought. So… the opposite of what happens when we
read. Questionnaires have also tried to get at the
question of how often people engage in inner speech, but they have a few limitations. Perhaps the most glaring is that people generally
aren’t great at being aware of their inner experiences, so questionnaires probably overestimate
the frequency of inner speech. More recently, researchers have started using
a procedure called Descriptive Experience Sampling, or DES instead. With DES, people carry a beeper that goes
off randomly throughout the day. And when it does, they write down some notes
about exactly what was going on in their  head at that moment. It’s like when you’re sitting across from
your friend and you’re like “what ya thinking about?” It’s not perfect. Some researchers think that DES goes too far
and underestimates inner speech, for example. But it is giving scientists a better sense
of how many people “hear” their thoughts and how often. And it’s revealed that inner monologues—like
most things in psychology—are on a spectrum. Very few people have no inner speech at all,
and very few people engage in it one hundred percent of the time. DES studies suggest that seventy to eighty-five
percent of people experience some kind of spontaneous inner speech at least occasionally. And of those people, most of them are talking
to themselves about fifteen to thirty percent of the time. It’s also possible to have more than one
internal experience simultaneously, so you might be visualizing something and talking
to yourself about it. And inner speech varies in other ways, too. While a lot of people talk about this in terms
of internal monologues, about seventy-five percent of people report that sometimes they’re
having back-and-forths in their head. They usually play both parts in the conversation,
though—only about twenty-five percent of people report that other people show up in
their inner speech. People who have ever had an imaginary friend
are more likely to use this kind of dialogic speech, even if they don’t have that friend
anymore. Which is pretty cute. Others might experience something a little
different but similar: what psychologists call imagined interactions. Basically, that’s when you imagine all the
things you should have said to that guy who stole your parking spot, or rehearse what
you’re going to say to your date later. What’s not clear in all of this is why people
have different inner monologues or dialogues, and what those differences say about them. We don’t even really know where inner speech
comes from. From an evolutionary standpoint, many experts
think that inner speech came about as part of the process for generating overt speech. It may even be a side effect of sorts of spoken
language that’s been co-opted for other cognitive tasks. See, when you go to speak, your brain simultaneously
sends signals to two different areas: one to motor parts of the brain to control the
mouth and the tongue and stuff, and a copy to the sensory parts of the brain. The sensory signal allows the brain to make
a prediction about what it’s about to hear. Essentially, you recite words in your head
as you say them out loud. And it turns out that same kind of signal
occurs during inner speech. That may be why you can quote “hear” yourself—you’re
literally activating the hearing part of your brain. And some psychologists think this means the
underlying purpose of internal speech is to catch errors when you talk. If the internal prediction matches what you
say, your brain knows it can filter your words out of what it’s hearing and focus on the
rest of the sounds coming in. If they don’t match—like if you stumble
over a word—your brain lets you know that you made a mistake so that you can stop and
correct yourself. But it doesn’t seem like this error correction
is absolutely essential for speech, because the two can be separated from one another. There are cases of people with brain damage
who lose their inner speech but not the ability to talk, and vice versa. Still, inner speech could have helped people
communicate better, which could explain why it evolved. This is just the prevailing hypothesis, though,
and it’s possible it’s wrong. Also, it’s likely that even if inner speech
started this way, the brain has repurposed it for other uses. Those other uses might explain why it differs
between people. Some psychologists think our everyday inner
speech reflects conversations that we had out loud as kids—especially moments when
our caregivers talked us through solving a problem or calmed us down. The idea is that these teaching moments get
internalized as we grow up, and then we essentially replay them in our heads later—which would
explain why inner speech often resembles  a conversation. And, this could explain why, content-wise,
it’s often about self-regulation—things like problem-solving, planning things out,
time management, and motivation. Those are all things someone would help talk
their young child through. Plus, the same brain areas are activated during
internal dialogic speech and when a person is thinking about someone else’s experience
and perspective. That would make sense if the voice in your
head is basically your brain recycling someone else’s words. So, if this theory is correct, inner speech
might be different between people simply because their upbringings and social interactions
were different. We still don’t know how or if those differences
matter, mind you. But there are some big clues that inner speech
plays an important role in cognition—so, all those brain processes involved in thinking. For instance, scientists have used a test
called a dual-task paradigm to see how inner speech affects problem solving. Basically, they ask the person to solve a
problem while doing something else. And if that second task is physical—like,
tapping their foot—they generally have no problem with it. But if it’s verbal—like, remembering a
list of words—then they perform worse. Researchers think that’s because those words
disrupt their inner speech, making it so they can’t really talk themselves through the
problem. Inner speech may also be an important tool
for memory, and more specifically, working memory. That’s the memory where you store the information
you want to access really quickly. One of the components in working memory is
the ability to repeat information to yourself until you no longer need it—and for that,
you need inner speech. In fact, people who do more self-managing
inner speech—so, things like talking themselves through solving a problem—do seem to do
better on some cognitive tasks. So differences in how people talk to themselves
might underlie differences in how well they perform different kinds of thinking. Inner speech may also play a part in mental
health conditions. Research has connected it to depression and
anxiety, for example. People who have more depressive tendencies
tend to experience more depressive self-talk. And we know that people who are more anxious
tend to engage in more self-critical inner speech. It’s not clear if these negative forms of
inner speech exacerbate or even cause those conditions, or if the conditions lead to higher
amounts of negative inner speech. Though, studies have found that if you ask
people to think verbally about hypothetical situations—even positive ones—their mood
is lower than if you ask them to picture the hypothetical situations instead. And that does support the idea that the speech
part of inner speech might make people less happy… for some reason. Other research has tied inner speech to symptoms
common in psychotic disorders. For example, people with schizophrenia often
report hearing voices of people speaking to them or telling them what to do. One theory is that those “voices” are
actually inner speech. Remember that prediction signal I mentioned
earlier? Well, some experts think that if something
in that neural circuit is off, then the brain’s usual way of identifying self-made sounds
and thoughts could be off, too. So basically, that person’s brain might
not be so great at separating sounds they generate from ones they hear. And that may mean it also attributes inner
speech to someone else. Because of these potentially important roles
in cognition and mental health, psychologists are eager to gain a better understanding of
what inner speech is and why it happens. And figuring all that out could tell us a
lot about, well, a lot—from how our brains develop and work to what’s actually happening
in a variety of mental disorders. But as of right now, we just don’t know
that much about this thing most of us do every day. There are a lot of big questions currently
unanswered, like where inner speech comes from, why it differs between people, and what
those differences mean. Like, can you change your inner monologue? Can you train yourself to think in conversations,
or to hear other voices or your own more often? We don’t even know if you should want to
make those changes—if there are the benefits or downsides of different kinds of inner speech. And it’s probably going to be a while before
we have any clear answers, because our methods for studying it just aren’t great, and there’s
a lot of debate over basic questions, like how many people even do it in the first place. In the meantime, though, you can still talk

us a lot about how our brains work, how they develop, and how we speak. But… research on all this is really just
getting started. Inner speech is somewhat loosely defined as
when a person “speaks” meaningful thoughts without producing sound or moving any part
of their body, like their tongue or their lips. Though, in some ways, it’s easier to define
by what it isn’t. It’s different from visualizing or picturing
things in your head. And it doesn’t include feelings like happiness
or hunger, or your awareness of sensory experiences, like noticing the glint of something shiny
on the ground. So basically, it only refers to thoughts accompanied
by specific words. These words usually have the same tone, inflection,
and even accent that they would if were spoken aloud—though not always, which we’ll get
to in a bit. Even figuring that much out about inner speech
was somewhat of a challenge for psychologists, because—surprise!—it’s really hard to
measure people’s internal experiences. So there’s been a lot of variation in research
methods, and not a lot of agreement between different studies and different scientists. For example, some studies have tried to see
inside people’s heads by prompting them to hear specific words or phrases in their
mind—like, by asking them to read something silently or determine if two words rhyme without
saying them out loud. That’s revealed some weird quirks about
inner speech—like that, when people read, they’re actually much more likely to mentally
say single words that represent a passage than every word of every sentence. But prompted inner speech and spontaneous
inner speech aren’t really the same. Plus, prompts can't tell us much about how
frequently or why people use inner speech in their daily life. So, some researchers use questionnaires instead. According to those, these conversations we
have with ourselves are generally about... ourselves. And kind of in a bad way. Most of the time, our inner speech consists
of negative things about ourselves, our negative emotions, or us trying to decide if we’re
good enough. And, weirdly enough, that’s all usually
in full sentences. Only about one-third of people experience
abbreviated inner speech, where a single word or phrase represents an entire complex thought. So… the opposite of what happens when we
read. Questionnaires have also tried to get at the
question of how often people engage in inner speech, but they have a few limitations. Perhaps the most glaring is that people generally
aren’t great at being aware of their inner experiences, so questionnaires probably overestimate
the frequency of inner speech. More recently, researchers have started using
a procedure called Descriptive Experience Sampling, or DES instead. With DES, people carry a beeper that goes
off randomly throughout the day. And when it does, they write down some notes
about exactly what was going on in their  head at that moment. It’s like when you’re sitting across from
your friend and you’re like “what ya thinking about?” It’s not perfect. Some researchers think that DES goes too far
and underestimates inner speech, for example. But it is giving scientists a better sense
of how many people “hear” their thoughts and how often. And it’s revealed that inner monologues—like
most things in psychology—are on a spectrum. Very few people have no inner speech at all,
and very few people engage in it one hundred percent of the time. DES studies suggest that seventy to eighty-five
percent of people experience some kind of spontaneous inner speech at least occasionally. And of those people, most of them are talking
to themselves about fifteen to thirty percent of the time. It’s also possible to have more than one
internal experience simultaneously, so you might be visualizing something and talking
to yourself about it. And inner speech varies in other ways, too. While a lot of people talk about this in terms
of internal monologues, about seventy-five percent of people report that sometimes they’re
having back-and-forths in their head. They usually play both parts in the conversation,
though—only about twenty-five percent of people report that other people show up in
their inner speech. People who have ever had an imaginary friend
are more likely to use this kind of dialogic speech, even if they don’t have that friend
anymore. Which is pretty cute. Others might experience something a little
different but similar: what psychologists call imagined interactions. Basically, that’s when you imagine all the
things you should have said to that guy who stole your parking spot, or rehearse what
you’re going to say to your date later. What’s not clear in all of this is why people
have different inner monologues or dialogues, and what those differences say about them. We don’t even really know where inner speech
comes from. From an evolutionary standpoint, many experts
think that inner speech came about as part of the process for generating overt speech. It may even be a side effect of sorts of spoken
language that’s been co-opted for other cognitive tasks. See, when you go to speak, your brain simultaneously
sends signals to two different areas: one to motor parts of the brain to control the
mouth and the tongue and stuff, and a copy to the sensory parts of the brain. The sensory signal allows the brain to make
a prediction about what it’s about to hear. Essentially, you recite words in your head
as you say them out loud. And it turns out that same kind of signal
occurs during inner speech. That may be why you can quote “hear” yourself—you’re
literally activating the hearing part of your brain. And some psychologists think this means the
underlying purpose of internal speech is to catch errors when you talk. If the internal prediction matches what you
say, your brain knows it can filter your words out of what it’s hearing and focus on the
rest of the sounds coming in. If they don’t match—like if you stumble
over a word—your brain lets you know that you made a mistake so that you can stop and
correct yourself. But it doesn’t seem like this error correction
is absolutely essential for speech, because the two can be separated from one another. There are cases of people with brain damage
who lose their inner speech but not the ability to talk, and vice versa. Still, inner speech could have helped people
communicate better, which could explain why it evolved. This is just the prevailing hypothesis, though,
and it’s possible it’s wrong. Also, it’s likely that even if inner speech
started this way, the brain has repurposed it for other uses. Those other uses might explain why it differs
between people. Some psychologists think our everyday inner
speech reflects conversations that we had out loud as kids—especially moments when
our caregivers talked us through solving a problem or calmed us down. The idea is that these teaching moments get
internalized as we grow up, and then we essentially replay them in our heads later—which would
explain why inner speech often resembles  a conversation. And, this could explain why, content-wise,
it’s often about self-regulation—things like problem-solving, planning things out,
time management, and motivation. Those are all things someone would help talk
their young child through. Plus, the same brain areas are activated during
internal dialogic speech and when a person is thinking about someone else’s experience
and perspective. That would make sense if the voice in your
head is basically your brain recycling someone else’s words. So, if this theory is correct, inner speech
might be different between people simply because their upbringings and social interactions
were different. We still don’t know how or if those differences
matter, mind you. But there are some big clues that inner speech
plays an important role in cognition—so, all those brain processes involved in thinking. For instance, scientists have used a test
called a dual-task paradigm to see how inner speech affects problem solving. Basically, they ask the person to solve a
problem while doing something else. And if that second task is physical—like,
tapping their foot—they generally have no problem with it. But if it’s verbal—like, remembering a
list of words—then they perform worse. Researchers think that’s because those words
disrupt their inner speech, making it so they can’t really talk themselves through the
problem. Inner speech may also be an important tool
for memory, and more specifically, working memory. That’s the memory where you store the information
you want to access really quickly. One of the components in working memory is
the ability to repeat information to yourself until you no longer need it—and for that,
you need inner speech. In fact, people who do more self-managing
inner speech—so, things like talking themselves through solving a problem—do seem to do
better on some cognitive tasks. So differences in how people talk to themselves
might underlie differences in how well they perform different kinds of thinking. Inner speech may also play a part in mental
health conditions. Research has connected it to depression and
anxiety, for example. People who have more depressive tendencies
tend to experience more depressive self-talk. And we know that people who are more anxious
tend to engage in more self-critical inner speech. It’s not clear if these negative forms of
inner speech exacerbate or even cause those conditions, or if the conditions lead to higher
amounts of negative inner speech. Though, studies have found that if you ask
people to think verbally about hypothetical situations—even positive ones—their mood
is lower than if you ask them to picture the hypothetical situations instead. And that does support the idea that the speech
part of inner speech might make people less happy… for some reason. Other research has tied inner speech to symptoms
common in psychotic disorders. For example, people with schizophrenia often
report hearing voices of people speaking to them or telling them what to do. One theory is that those “voices” are
actually inner speech. Remember that prediction signal I mentioned
earlier? Well, some experts think that if something
in that neural circuit is off, then the brain’s usual way of identifying self-made sounds
and thoughts could be off, too. So basically, that person’s brain might
not be so great at separating sounds they generate from ones they hear. And that may mean it also attributes inner
speech to someone else. Because of these potentially important roles
in cognition and mental health, psychologists are eager to gain a better understanding of
what inner speech is and why it happens. And figuring all that out could tell us a
lot about, well, a lot—from how our brains develop and work to what’s actually happening
in a variety of mental disorders. But as of right now, we just don’t know
that much about this thing most of us do every day. There are a lot of big questions currently
unanswered, like where inner speech comes from, why it differs between people, and what
those differences mean. Like, can you change your inner monologue? Can you train yourself to think in conversations,
or to hear other voices or your own more often? We don’t even know if you should want to
make those changes—if there are the benefits or downsides of different kinds of inner speech. And it’s probably going to be a while before
we have any clear answers, because our methods for studying it just aren’t great, and there’s
a lot of debate over basic questions, like how many people even do it in the first place. In the meantime, though, you can still talk

[ ♪ intro ] Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that writers
give so many superheroes, alien beings, and magical creatures the power of telepathy. Just imagine what you could learn about a
person if you could hear their thoughts. Well, actually, I’ve just made a bit of
an assumption there: that there’d be something to hear. Because not everyone has that kind of internal

to feel like you’re not wanted— and we do mean painful. fMRI studies have found that rejection
elicits brain activity in multiple neural regions
that process physical pain. And the language we use to describe
rejection mirrors this experience. Researchers recorded over a dozen
languages that relate rejection to being hurt, using terms like 
“crushed” or “broken-hearted.” So why does rejection trigger
such a strong response, and is there any way to cope 
with this unique kind of pain? Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we perceive 
that others don’t value having social connections with us. This could occur when we’re
abandoned by a romantic partner, excluded from a group,
or outright discriminated against. But it’s worth noting that these
interpersonal rejections have a social element that distinguishes
them from not getting a job. In these experiences, we perceive that the rejecting party 
undervalues our relationship. And while the pain of rejection
often increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers
can hurt our feelings. This might seem like an overreaction, but just as bodily pain warns 
us about perceived threats to our physical well-being, hurt feelings warn us about perceived
threats to our social well-being. Some behavioral psychologists
argue this warning system developed when our prehistoric ancestors lived
in small clans and depended on everyone they knew 
for survival. These humans may have evolved to perceive
rejection from anyone as a potential threat to their safety. It’s impossible to confirm this
kind of evolutionary theory, but wherever this warning
system came from, it doesn't include instructions for how to process this intense
emotional experience. So, the next time you’re feeling rejected,
try asking yourself these questions. The first thing to consider
is your relationship with the person rejecting you. Is this someone who knows you well
and whose opinion you hold dear? Or is it just a loose acquaintance? If it’s the latter, that might help
you answer the second question: does this rejection really matter? It can sting when a stranger
doesn't laugh at your joke, but it doesn’t make sense
to react strongly to a rejection with little impact on your life. Of course, brushing off even a minor 
rejection is easier said than done, since how you perceive yourself 
also factors into this equation. You likely feel more confident 
in some circumstances than others, and people tend to be especially sensitive
to rejection in situations where they have a low opinion
of themselves. So much so, that they even become 
more likely to misinterpret other people’s neutral reactions 
as rejections. This is why it can be helpful 
to both reflect on your self-view and ask yourself if the other person
is actually rejecting you. This might seem like an odd question. But you may find that while the
other person didn’t treat you as you would have liked, 
they still value your relationship. In some cases, it's also
helpful to consider whether you were expecting more acceptance
than was reasonable. Unfortunately, after asking
these questions, you might still conclude 
that a person close to you doesn’t value your relationship
as much as you do. This is a painful realization, but it
can help to remember two things. First, this rejection isn't
just about you. The other party wants something different
from your relationship, and what they want might 
be unreasonable, unfair, or simply not what you have to give. Second, their rejection isn’t proof 
that there’s something wrong with you. The pain you’re feeling 
is just part of a system nudging you to think about
your interpersonal relationships. And by reflecting on your behavior, you can find clues to help better
understand the rejection and think critically 
about the relationship you want to have with this person. Every relationship and rejection 
is unique. But whatever the specifics, it’s important to remember 
that you’re never alone in all of this. Everyone deals with rejection
throughout their life— even those who seem confident
in their belonging. And one of the most common ways to cope
with this universal experience is to reconnect with those 
who already accept you.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not directly compare rejection to another concept like the ground truth MCQ, it does relate rejection to physical pain, which is the correct comparison in the ground truth MCQ. The options in Question 1 also focus on how people describe rejection, which includes using terms related to physical pain. This connection to physical pain aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose another question that more closely matches the comparison aspect of the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 3. Question 3 explains why rejection might hurt, even from a stranger, by comparing it to a warning system for physical pain, which is similar to the comparison made in the ground truth MCQ.

But since Question 1 is more directly related to the concept of rejection being compared to physical pain, I would say:

**Transcript**:
Rejection hurts. It’s incredibly painful
to feel like you’re not wanted— and we do mean painful. fMRI studies have found that rejection
elicits brain activity in multiple neural regions
that process physical pain. And the language we use to describe
rejection mirrors this experience. Researchers recorded over a dozen
languages that relate rejection to being hurt, using terms like 
“crushed” or “broken-hearted.” So why does rejection trigger
such a strong response, and is there any way to cope 
with this unique kind of pain? Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we perceive 
that others don’t value having social connections with us. This could occur when we’re
abandoned by a romantic partner, excluded from a group,
or outright discriminated against. But it’s worth noting that these
interpersonal rejections have a social element that distinguishes
them from not getting a job. In these experiences, we perceive that the rejecting party 
undervalues our relationship. And while the pain of rejection
often increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers
can hurt our feelings. This might seem like an overreaction, but just as bodily pain warns 
us about perceived threats to our physical well-being, hurt feelings warn us about perceived
threats to our social well-being. Some behavioral psychologists
argue this warning system developed when our prehistoric ancestors lived
in small clans and depended on everyone they knew 
for survival. These humans may have evolved to perceive
rejection from anyone as a potential threat to their safety. It’s impossible to confirm this
kind of evolutionary theory, but wherever this warning
system came from, it doesn't include instructions for how to process this intense
emotional experience. So, the next time you’re feeling rejected,
try asking yourself these questions. The first thing to consider
is your relationship with the person rejecting you. Is this someone who knows you well
and whose opinion you hold dear? Or is it just a loose acquaintance? If it’s the latter, that might help
you answer the second question: does this rejection really matter? It can sting when a stranger
doesn't laugh at your joke, but it doesn’t make sense
to react strongly to a rejection with little impact on your life. Of course, brushing off even a minor 
rejection is easier said than done, since how you perceive yourself 
also factors into this equation. You likely feel more confident 
in some circumstances than others, and people tend to be especially sensitive
to rejection in situations where they have a low opinion
of themselves. So much so, that they even become 
more likely to misinterpret other people’s neutral reactions 
as rejections. This is why it can be helpful 
to both reflect on your self-view and ask yourself if the other person
is actually rejecting you. This might seem like an odd question. But you may find that while the
other person didn’t treat you as you would have liked, 
they still value your relationship. In some cases, it's also
helpful to consider whether you were expecting more acceptance
than was reasonable. Unfortunately, after asking
these questions, you might still conclude 
that a person close to you doesn’t value your relationship
as much as you do. This is a painful realization, but it
can help to remember two things. First, this rejection isn't
just about you. The other party wants something different
from your relationship, and what they want might 
be unreasonable, unfair, or simply not what you have to give. Second, their rejection isn’t proof 
that there’s something wrong with you. The pain you’re feeling 
is just part of a system nudging you to think about
your interpersonal relationships. And by reflecting on your behavior, you can find clues to help better
understand the rejection and think critically 
about the relationship you want to have with this person. Every relationship and rejection 
is unique. But whatever the specifics, it’s important to remember 
that you’re never alone in all of this. Everyone deals with rejection
throughout their life— even those who seem confident
in their belonging. And one of the most common ways to cope
with this universal experience is to reconnect with those 
who already accept you.

**Transcript**:
During the 1600s, an expansive autonomous
settlement called Palmares reached its height in northeastern Brazil. It was founded and led by people escaping
from slavery, also called maroons. In fact, it was one of the world’s
largest maroon communities, its population reaching beyond 10,000. And its citizens were at constant war 
with colonial forces. The records we have about Palmares
mainly come from biased Dutch and Portuguese sources, but historians have managed 
to piece much of its story together. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade,
which began in the 1500s, nearly half of all enslaved African people
were sent to Portugal’s American colony: Brazil. Some escaped and sought
shelter in Brazil’s interior regions, where they formed settlements
called mocambos or quilombos. Fugitives from slavery probably arrived
in the northeast in the late 1500s. By the 1660s, their camps
had consolidated into a powerful confederation known today
as the Quilombo of Palmares. It consisted of a central capital
linking dozens of villages, which specialized in particular
agricultural goods or served as military training grounds. Citizens of Palmares, or Palmaristas,
were governed by a king and defended by an organized military. African people and Brazilian-born 
Black and Indigenous people all came seeking refuge. They collectively fished, hunted,
raised livestock, planted orchards, and grew crops 
like cassava, corn, and sugarcane. They also made use of the abundant 
palm trees for which Palmares was named, turning palm products 
into butter, wine, and light. Palmaristas crafted palm husks into pipes
and leaves into mats and baskets. They traded some of these goods
with Portuguese settlers for products like gunpowder and salt. In turn, settlers avoided Palmares’ raids during which they’d seize weapons
and take captives. The Portuguese were concerned 
with other invading imperialists, but regarded Indigenous
uprisings and Palmares as their internal threats. Palmares endangered the very
institution of slavery— the foundation of Brazil's economy. During the 1670s, the Portuguese
escalated their attacks. By this time, Ganga-Zumba
was Palmares’ leader. He ruled from the Macaco, 
which functioned as the capital. His allies and family members
governed the other villages— with women playing crucial roles 
in operation and defense. As they fought the Portuguese, Palmaristas
used the landscape to their advantage. Camouflaged and built in high places,
their mocambos offered superior lookouts. They constructed hidden ditches lined
with sharp stakes that swallowed unsuspecting soldiers 
and false roads that led to ambushes. They launched counterattacks
under the cover of night and were constantly abandoning 
and building settlements to elude the Portuguese. In 1678, after years of failed attacks, the Portuguese offered to negotiate
a peace treaty with Ganga-Zumba. The terms they agreed upon recognized
Palmares’ independence and the freedom of anyone born there. However, the treaty demanded that Palmares
pledge loyalty to the crown and return all past and future
fugitives from slavery. Many Palmaristas dissented, among them Zumbi— Ganga-Zumba’s nephew—
a rising leader himself. Before long, Ganga-Zumba was killed, likely by a group affiliated
with his nephew. As Palmares’ new leader, 
Zumbi rejected the treaty and resumed resistance 
for another 15 years. But in February of 1694, the Portuguese captured the capital 
after a devastating siege. Zumbi escaped, but they eventually
found and ambushed him. And on November 20th, 1695, 
Portuguese forces killed Zumbi. His death was not the end of Palmares,
but it was a crushing blow. After years of warfare, 
there were far fewer rebels in the area. Those who remained rallied around new
leaders and maintained a presence, however small, through the 1760s. Though, Palmares is no more thousands 
of other quilombos persist to this day. November 20th, the day of Zumbi’s death,
is celebrated across Brazil as the Day of Black Consciousness. But Zumbi was just one 
of many Palmaristas. We only know some of their names, but their fight for freedom 
echoes centuries later.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the historical context of Palmares.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time period when fugitive slaves first arrived in the area that became Palmares. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 1 mentions the 1600s as the time period when Palmares reached its height.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that discusses the early history or formation of Palmares, even if it doesn't directly ask about the arrival of fugitive slaves.

Considering the provided options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on historical context, I would suggest Question 1, but with the understanding that it's a very loose connection.

for another 15 years. But in February of 1694, the Portuguese captured the capital 
after a devastating siege. Zumbi escaped, but they eventually
found and ambushed him. And on November 20th, 1695, 
Portuguese forces killed Zumbi. His death was not the end of Palmares,
but it was a crushing blow. After years of warfare, 
there were far fewer rebels in the area. Those who remained rallied around new
leaders and maintained a presence, however small, through the 1760s. Though, Palmares is no more thousands 
of other quilombos persist to this day. November 20th, the day of Zumbi’s death,
is celebrated across Brazil as the Day of Black Consciousness. But Zumbi was just one 
of many Palmaristas. We only know some of their names, but their fight for freedom 
echoes centuries later.

**Transcript**:
During the 1600s, an expansive autonomous
settlement called Palmares reached its height in northeastern Brazil. It was founded and led by people escaping
from slavery, also called maroons. In fact, it was one of the world’s
largest maroon communities, its population reaching beyond 10,000. And its citizens were at constant war 
with colonial forces. The records we have about Palmares
mainly come from biased Dutch and Portuguese sources, but historians have managed 
to piece much of its story together. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade,
which began in the 1500s, nearly half of all enslaved African people
were sent to Portugal’s American colony: Brazil. Some escaped and sought
shelter in Brazil’s interior regions, where they formed settlements
called mocambos or quilombos. Fugitives from slavery probably arrived
in the northeast in the late 1500s. By the 1660s, their camps
had consolidated into a powerful confederation known today
as the Quilombo of Palmares. It consisted of a central capital
linking dozens of villages, which specialized in particular
agricultural goods or served as military training grounds. Citizens of Palmares, or Palmaristas,
were governed by a king and defended by an organized military. African people and Brazilian-born 
Black and Indigenous people all came seeking refuge. They collectively fished, hunted,
raised livestock, planted orchards, and grew crops 
like cassava, corn, and sugarcane. They also made use of the abundant 
palm trees for which Palmares was named, turning palm products 
into butter, wine, and light. Palmaristas crafted palm husks into pipes
and leaves into mats and baskets. They traded some of these goods
with Portuguese settlers for products like gunpowder and salt. In turn, settlers avoided Palmares’ raids during which they’d seize weapons
and take captives. The Portuguese were concerned 
with other invading imperialists, but regarded Indigenous
uprisings and Palmares as their internal threats. Palmares endangered the very
institution of slavery— the foundation of Brazil's economy. During the 1670s, the Portuguese
escalated their attacks. By this time, Ganga-Zumba
was Palmares’ leader. He ruled from the Macaco, 
which functioned as the capital. His allies and family members
governed the other villages— with women playing crucial roles 
in operation and defense. As they fought the Portuguese, Palmaristas
used the landscape to their advantage. Camouflaged and built in high places,
their mocambos offered superior lookouts. They constructed hidden ditches lined
with sharp stakes that swallowed unsuspecting soldiers 
and false roads that led to ambushes. They launched counterattacks
under the cover of night and were constantly abandoning 
and building settlements to elude the Portuguese. In 1678, after years of failed attacks, the Portuguese offered to negotiate
a peace treaty with Ganga-Zumba. The terms they agreed upon recognized
Palmares’ independence and the freedom of anyone born there. However, the treaty demanded that Palmares
pledge loyalty to the crown and return all past and future
fugitives from slavery. Many Palmaristas dissented, among them Zumbi— Ganga-Zumba’s nephew—
a rising leader himself. Before long, Ganga-Zumba was killed, likely by a group affiliated
with his nephew. As Palmares’ new leader, 
Zumbi rejected the treaty and resumed resistance 
for another 15 years. But in February of 1694, the Portuguese captured the capital 
after a devastating siege. Zumbi escaped, but they eventually

What is the smartest age? Perhaps a day of friendly competition
will lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon
of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest,
most capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, 
but don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and 
is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, 
designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player
in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed 
in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick!
Who’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir
choose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated
with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture
the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea 
of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best
at each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible 
rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural
connections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes
through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened 
and unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways
are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, 
allowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient,
fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens 
within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills 
to flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions
involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can
learn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible 
for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may
struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, 
planning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more
flexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches
when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, 
less afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own
unique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed
prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills
that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient 
puzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, 
these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, 
known as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase
“older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge
to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider
are his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical 
regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate
logic and math puzzles. Simultaneously,
deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation
and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be 
curious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think
of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new 
experiences  and learn quickly. You’re at a dynamic stage, where the choices you make
and the skills you focus on can actually guide the development 
of your brain. So, what’s the smartest age? There’s no single answer. It’s 8, 16, 25, 65, 
and everything in between; our brains have adapted to prioritize
different skills at various ages to meet that stage of life’s challenges
and demands. So no matter who Amir picks, having 
an age-diverse team is a good strategy.

Although the specific details about synaptogenesis (i.e., the formation of more than 1 million new neural connections every second) are not present in Question 3, it is the closest match in terms of discussing brain development and neural connections.

However, it's essential to note that the generated MCQs do not contain a direct match for the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 3 is the closest match, but I would recommend creating a new MCQ that directly addresses the concept of synaptogenesis and its specifics.

Index: 3 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
What is the smartest age? Perhaps a day of friendly competition
will lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon
of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest,
most capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, 
but don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and 
is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, 
designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player
in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed 
in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick!
Who’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir
choose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated
with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture
the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea 
of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best
at each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible 
rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural
connections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes
through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened 
and unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways
are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, 
allowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient,
fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens 
within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills 
to flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions
involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can
learn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible 
for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may
struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, 
planning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more
flexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches
when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, 
less afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own
unique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed
prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills
that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient 
puzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, 
these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, 
known as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase
“older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge
to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider
are his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical 
regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate
logic and math puzzles. Simultaneously,
deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation
and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be 
curious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think
of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new 
experiences  and learn quickly. You’re at a dynamic stage, where the choices you make
and the skills you focus on can actually guide the development 
of your brain. So, what’s the smartest age? There’s no single answer. It’s 8, 16, 25, 65, 
and everything in between; our brains have adapted to prioritize
different skills at various ages to meet that stage of life’s challenges
and demands. So no matter who Amir picks, having 
an age-diverse team is a good strategy.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

However, Question 5 is almost identical to Question 4, and both questions match the ground truth MCQ. Since Question 5 is a better match in terms of wording, I would choose Question 5 as the most similar generated MCQ.

But since the options of Questions 4 and 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, let's look at other questions. Question 6 discusses the advantages of adults over children in terms of cognitive abilities, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon closer inspection, Question 8 is not a direct match, but it does discuss the abilities of different age groups. However, it does not specifically compare young children to adults.

Considering all the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although Question 9 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the advantages of adolescents compared to adults and children, while Question 9 asks about a characteristic of teenagers like Amir in terms of their brain development. 

However, the correct option for Question 9 (C. They are driven to be curious and adventurous learners) partially matches one of the correct aspects mentioned in the ground truth MCQ's correct option (D. Their brains are wired to seek new experience AND their brains are more developed than children). 

Additionally, Question 6 could be considered a match in terms of comparing cognitive abilities across age groups, but it focuses on the advantages of adults over children, rather than adolescents.

It's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk
once a week for 8 consecutive weeks, each time on a different 
alcoholic beverage, and each time with precisely 
the same dosage— this was science,
after all. The goal of this experiment was to find
out which alcoholic drinks cause worse hangovers. Of course, it takes much more than one 
small study to answer such a question. Since then, science has
learned a lot about hangovers— though some mysteries remain. The molecule responsible 
for hangovers is ethanol, which we colloquially refer to as alcohol. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic
beverages, and generally speaking, the more ethanol, 
the greater the potential for a hangover. The symptoms and severity can vary
depending on weight, age, genetics, and other factors. But still, hangovers generally share 
some common— and unpleasant— features. So how exactly does alcohol
cause a hangover? And is there any way 
to reliably prevent one? Alcohol slows down the communication
between neural cells. After someone has had their last drink, as the concentration of alcohol 
in the blood drops back to zero, the brain rebounds from sedation 
and swings in the other direction, entering a hyperactive state. This may lead to the tremors or 
rapid heartbeat associated with hangovers. It also makes sleep shorter 
and less restful than normal. But these effects are just the beginning— alcohol impacts so many 
of the body’s processes, throwing delicate balances off-kilter. And even the most familiar hangover
symptoms have surprising contributors. For example, alcohol disrupts
levels of many hormones. One of those hormones is cortisol. Normally, fluctuating cortisol levels
help regulate wakefulness throughout the day and night. So the disruption in cortisol 
during a hangover may cause people to feel groggy 
or disoriented. Another hormone alcohol interferes
with is vasopressin, which normally decreases the volume 
of urine made by the kidneys. By decreasing levels of vasopressin, alcohol causes people to pee more
and become dehydrated. Dehydration can lead to thirst, dry mouth,
weakness, lightheadedness, and headache, one of the most common hangover symptoms. In addition to dehydration, 
hangover headaches can result from alcohol’s influence 
on chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters
involved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing
the ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,
weakness, and mood disturbances experienced during a hangover. Meanwhile, alcohol stimulates
the immune system, leading to inflammation that can
damage cells within the brain, affect mood, and impair memory. And it can irritate 
the gastrointestinal tract and inflame the lining 
of the stomach and intestines. Alcohol may also slow down
stomach emptying, which could lead to increased
production of gastric acid. This is why alcohol can cause 
stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Alcoholic drinks also contain other
substances that are produced during the fermentation process 
that give the drink its specific flavor. Some evidence suggests that one of these,
methanol, is particularly bad for hangovers. The body doesn’t start
metabolizing methanol until it’s done processing ethanol. And when it does, 
the toxic metabolites of methanol may potentially worsen 
the hangover symptoms. Beverages that are closer to pure ethanol,
such as gin and vodka, may cause fewer hangover effects. Meanwhile, the presence of flavoring
ingredients in beverages like whiskey, brandy, and red wine, may make these kinds of alcohol 
cause more hangover symptoms. So, the choice of alcoholic
beverage matters, but any of them can cause hangovers,
simply because they all contain alcohol. So, do common hangover remedies
actually work? Drinking water and electrolyte beverages
can help reduce symptoms related to dehydration. And eating— especially carbs—
can help replenish the glucose levels alcohol reduces. But ultimately, the only sure way 
to prevent a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation
or not at all.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the molecule responsible for causing hangovers, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the biggest factor leading to the incidence and severity of hangovers.

A more relevant generated MCQ that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ is not present. However, if we consider the content and intent, Question 5 can be considered a relevant match, as it implies that drinking alcohol (the amount of alcohol consumed) is the primary factor in hangover prevention.

However, if we only consider the options and the intent, Question 10 can be considered the most similar generated MCQ, as it compares the effects of different types of alcoholic beverages, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the factors leading to hangover incidence and severity.

Considering all the aspects, I would choose Question 10 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the understanding that there is no perfect match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about a neural mechanism not linked to the development of a hangover, and the correct option is "excess sleep." While none of the generated MCQs directly ask the same question, Question 2 deals with the neural mechanism of how alcohol affects communication between neural cells, which is related to the rebound excitatory activity mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (Option A). 

Although Question 2 does not have the same intent as the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and relation to neural mechanisms. However, it is essential to note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk
once a week for 8 consecutive weeks, each time on a different 
alcoholic beverage, and each time with precisely 
the same dosage— this was science,
after all. The goal of this experiment was to find
out which alcoholic drinks cause worse hangovers. Of course, it takes much more than one 
small study to answer such a question. Since then, science has
learned a lot about hangovers— though some mysteries remain. The molecule responsible 
for hangovers is ethanol, which we colloquially refer to as alcohol. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic
beverages, and generally speaking, the more ethanol, 
the greater the potential for a hangover. The symptoms and severity can vary
depending on weight, age, genetics, and other factors. But still, hangovers generally share 
some common— and unpleasant— features. So how exactly does alcohol
cause a hangover? And is there any way 
to reliably prevent one? Alcohol slows down the communication
between neural cells. After someone has had their last drink, as the concentration of alcohol 
in the blood drops back to zero, the brain rebounds from sedation 
and swings in the other direction, entering a hyperactive state. This may lead to the tremors or 
rapid heartbeat associated with hangovers. It also makes sleep shorter 
and less restful than normal. But these effects are just the beginning— alcohol impacts so many 
of the body’s processes, throwing delicate balances off-kilter. And even the most familiar hangover
symptoms have surprising contributors. For example, alcohol disrupts
levels of many hormones. One of those hormones is cortisol. Normally, fluctuating cortisol levels
help regulate wakefulness throughout the day and night. So the disruption in cortisol 
during a hangover may cause people to feel groggy 
or disoriented. Another hormone alcohol interferes
with is vasopressin, which normally decreases the volume 
of urine made by the kidneys. By decreasing levels of vasopressin, alcohol causes people to pee more
and become dehydrated. Dehydration can lead to thirst, dry mouth,
weakness, lightheadedness, and headache, one of the most common hangover symptoms. In addition to dehydration, 
hangover headaches can result from alcohol’s influence 
on chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters
involved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing
the ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,
weakness, and mood disturbances experienced during a hangover. Meanwhile, alcohol stimulates
the immune system, leading to inflammation that can
damage cells within the brain, affect mood, and impair memory. And it can irritate 
the gastrointestinal tract and inflame the lining 
of the stomach and intestines. Alcohol may also slow down
stomach emptying, which could lead to increased
production of gastric acid. This is why alcohol can cause 
stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Alcoholic drinks also contain other
substances that are produced during the fermentation process 
that give the drink its specific flavor. Some evidence suggests that one of these,
methanol, is particularly bad for hangovers. The body doesn’t start
metabolizing methanol until it’s done processing ethanol. And when it does, 
the toxic metabolites of methanol may potentially worsen 
the hangover symptoms. Beverages that are closer to pure ethanol,
such as gin and vodka, may cause fewer hangover effects. Meanwhile, the presence of flavoring
ingredients in beverages like whiskey, brandy, and red wine, may make these kinds of alcohol 
cause more hangover symptoms. So, the choice of alcoholic
beverage matters, but any of them can cause hangovers,
simply because they all contain alcohol. So, do common hangover remedies
actually work? Drinking water and electrolyte beverages
can help reduce symptoms related to dehydration. And eating— especially carbs—
can help replenish the glucose levels alcohol reduces. But ultimately, the only sure way 
to prevent a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation
or not at all.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber:  When I’m out at the grocery store
or maybe a restaurant or the park with my son --
he’s six and a half -- people will stop us and mention
that they think that he’s handsome. I agree. They'll use that opportunity
to chop it up with him, and often when they're done
talking with him, they’ll mention that they think
he’s a smart and engaging little guy. When those people walk away,
the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember
meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man. This thought comes to my mind because I’ve written two books about race
and racism in the United States, and this kind of work
can produce feelings of pessimism. One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have
an orientation toward progress. In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate
the distance between where we were and where we are now. But that same orientation can blind us
from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be. The other thing I’ve learned
about Americans is that we have a very,
very narrow understanding of racism, mostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people -- old people from the South. And this really narrow definition
can constrain our opportunities to produce a more
racially egalitarian society. We like to hunt for races and distance ourselves from people who say
mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s. But the fact of the matter is that
we might just need to look in the mirror. Now, I'm not saying
that everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying
is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequality. Some people say, “Well, you do all this
work about racism. What’s the answer?” And I say that the first thing
we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what racism is in the first place. History shows that racists
have had the upper hand in deciding who the racists are
and what racism is, and it’s never them
or the things that they do. But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise
definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren’t in constant
fear of their children’s lives. I'd like to dispel
three myths about racism on our trek toward mutual understanding. First: it’s true that the South has done
its work to earn its reputation as the most racist region. But there are other states and regions
that are competing for the title. For example, if we look at the most segregated states
in terms of where Black kids go to school, we'll see, sure, some are in the South. There are some out west, in the Midwest and in the Northeast. They're where we live. Or if we look at states
with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them
are in the South. They're where we live. My colleague Rebecca Kreitzer and I looked at a standard battery
of racial attitudes of prejudice, and we found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated
the most racially negative attitudes. But this geography has evolved,
and things have changed. By 2016, we found
that the Dakotas, Nebraska, states in the Midwest, in the Northeast, were competing for the "most prejudiced
population" titles. Now, I'm not saying that one state
is more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own
special brand of racism. And it doesn't have to be like this. Most of the inequalities that we see in
our day-to-day lives happen at the state and local level. What that means is that we don't
have to go all the way to Congress to make change in our communities. We can simply hold our city, our county,
our state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomes. Myth two: we're not that good
at hunting for racists. Remember that time when the governor
of Virginia did blackface, and people were like, "Oh, that's bad.
I need to get that racist out of here"? I was giving y'all the side-eye,
and here's why. While people were going back to yearbooks to look for things
that were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into
the current-day policy stances of legislators who probably did
blackface but didn't get caught. So, how many of us
might have supported a candidate who is willing to let neighborhoods
secede from their district so that kids could go
to all-white schools -- in the 21st century? Or how many of us might have
supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced
some groups' chances of voting? Or how many of us might have focused on
the behavior of Black mothers rather than doctors or health care
systems and policies when we learn about
the huge racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality? It doesn't have to be like this. We could do something different. We could scrutinize the behaviors
of the rule makers. We could orient ourselves
toward a more just society, and on our way there, we can't mystify practical
policy solutions. Myth three: If you believe that when all
the grandmas in Mississippi die that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work
of eradicating racism, but there are some things
that we should note. We know that young folks, young white
folks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it,
they're looking for it. But we also know that they don't
live diverse lives. Research shows that the average white
American literally has one black friend. And what that means is that most
don't have any at all. Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that
even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have
positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors
who aren't white. My research with Professor
Christopher DeSante shows that when we ask white millennials
their racial attitudes and policy preferences, that they're sometimes,
just as in other times, even more racially
conservative than boomers. When we ask them about the things
that are important to them, they don't have
any particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequality. How did we get like this? Well, one of the things we might
think about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems
that we want them to solve. Research shows that
white parents in particular will either choose to not talk
about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them
from a harsh racial reality or they instill colorblind lessons, and that can actually reinforce
negative racial attitudes. So it's kind of like how some of your parents
might have given you books about puberty so they didn't have to talk about
the birds and the bees, and then you tried to connect all the dots
and then you did it all wrong. It's like that. It doesn't have to be like this. We can do better. We can have hard
conversations with our kids so that they don't grow up
like many of us did, thinking that talking about racism
makes you a racist -- it doesn't -- and so that we can prevent them
from making the same mistakes that we've seen in the past. Remember a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live
in a post-racial world? Well, I say that it's time for us
to think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like
to live in a post-racist world. But in order to do that,
we'd have to come together to have a shared definition of racism -- not just in the matter
of hearts and minds, but in systems, policies, rules, decisions made over and over again
to marginalize some people -- and agree to become anti-racists --
people who learn more and do better. So we could ask harder
questions of candidates about their stances on racial inequality before we throw
our full weight behind them. We could buycott or boycott businesses whose practices don't align
with our values. We could talk to our kids about racism. We could figure out our state's
special brand of racism and work to eradicate it. People made racial disparities,
and people can unmake them. And sure, it'll be hard, but the fact of the matter is, someone is depending on us
to do nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi. My name is Aparna. I am a shopaholic -- (Laughter) and I'm addicted to online returns. (Laughter) Well, at least I was. At one time, I had two or three
packages of clothing delivered to me every other day. I would intentionally buy the same item in a couple different sizes
and many colors, because I did not know
what I really wanted. So I overordered, I tried things on,
and then I sent what didn't work back. Once my daughter was watching me
return some of those packages back, and she said, "Mom,
I think you have a problem." (Laughter) I didn't think so. I mean, it's free shipping
and free returns, right? (Laughter) I didn't even think twice about it, until I heard a statistic
at work that shocked me. You see, I'm a global solutions
director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting
with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs. One of their biggest concerns
was managing returns. Just this past holiday season alone, they had 7.5 million pieces
of clothing returned to them. I could not stop thinking about it. What happens to all
these returned clothes? So I came home and researched. And I learned that every year, four billion pounds of returned clothing
ends up in the landfill. That's like every resident in the US
did a load of laundry last night and decided to throw it
in the trash today. I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this." (Laughter) My job is to find solutions
to logistical issues like these -- not create them. So this issue became very personal to me. I said, "You know what?
We have to solve this." And we can, with some of the existing
systems we already have in place. And then I started to wonder:
How did we get here? I mean, it was only like six years ago
when a study recommended that offering free online returns
would drive customers to spend more. We started seeing companies
offering free online returns to drive more sales
and provide a better experience. What we didn't realize is that this would lead to more items
being returned as well. In the US, companies lost
$351 billion in sales in 2017 alone. Retailers are scrambling
to recover their losses. They try to place that returned item
online to be sold again, or they'll sell it to a discount partner or a liquidator. Basically, if companies cannot find
a place for this item quickly and economically, its place becomes the trash. Suddenly, I felt very guilty
for being that shopper, somebody who contributes to this. Who would have thought
my innocent shopping behavior would be hurting not only me, but our planet as well? And as I thought about what to do, I kept thinking: Why does the item have to be returned
to the retailer in the first place? What if there was another way, a win-win for everyone? What if when a person
is trying to return something, it could go to the next
shopper who wants it, and not the retailer? What if, instead of a return, they could do what I call a "green turn"? Consumers could use an app
to take pictures of the item and verify the condition
while returning it. Artificial intelligence systems could then
sort these clothes by condition -- mint condition or slightly used -- and direct it to the next
appropriate person. Mint-condition clothes could
automatically go to the next buyer, while slightly used clothes
could be marked down and offered online again. The retailer can decide the business rules on the number of times
a particular item can be resold. All that the consumer would need to do
is obtain a mobile code, take it to the nearest shipping place
to be packed and shipped, and off it goes from
one buyer to the next, not the landfill. Now you will ask, "Would people really
go through all this trouble?" I think they would if they had incentives, like loyalty points or cash back. Let's call it "green cash." There would be a whole
new opportunity to make money from this new customer base
looking to buy these returns. This system would make
a fun thing like shopping a spiritual experience that helps save our planet. (Applause) This is doable and would probably take six months
to weave some of our existing systems and run a pilot. Even before any of these
logistical systems are in place, each of us shoppers can act now, if every single adult in the US
made a few small changes to our shopping behavior. Take the extra time
to research and think -- Do I really need this item? No: Do I really want this item? -- before making a purchase. And if every one of us adults in the US returned five less items this year, we would keep 240 million pounds
of clothes out of the landfill. Six percent reduction, just like that. This environmental problem
that we have created is not thousands of years away; it's happening today, and must stop now to prevent growing
landfills across the globe. I want to leave my daughter
and my daughter's daughter a better and cleaner place
than I found it, so I have not only stopped overordering, I recycle religiously as well. And you can, too. It's not difficult. Before we fill our shopping carts
and our landfills with extra items that we don't want, let's pause next time
we are shopping online and think twice about what we all
hopefully really do want: a beautiful Earth to call home. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi. My name is Aparna. I am a shopaholic -- (Laughter) and I'm addicted to online returns. (Laughter) Well, at least I was. At one time, I had two or three
packages of clothing delivered to me every other day. I would intentionally buy the same item in a couple different sizes
and many colors, because I did not know
what I really wanted. So I overordered, I tried things on,
and then I sent what didn't work back. Once my daughter was watching me
return some of those packages back, and she said, "Mom,
I think you have a problem." (Laughter) I didn't think so. I mean, it's free shipping
and free returns, right? (Laughter) I didn't even think twice about it, until I heard a statistic
at work that shocked me. You see, I'm a global solutions
director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting
with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs. One of their biggest concerns
was managing returns. Just this past holiday season alone, they had 7.5 million pieces
of clothing returned to them. I could not stop thinking about it. What happens to all
these returned clothes? So I came home and researched. And I learned that every year, four billion pounds of returned clothing
ends up in the landfill. That's like every resident in the US
did a load of laundry last night and decided to throw it
in the trash today. I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this." (Laughter) My job is to find solutions
to logistical issues like these -- not create them. So this issue became very personal to me. I said, "You know what?
We have to solve this." And we can, with some of the existing
systems we already have in place. And then I started to wonder:
How did we get here? I mean, it was only like six years ago
when a study recommended that offering free online returns
would drive customers to spend more. We started seeing companies
offering free online returns to drive more sales
and provide a better experience. What we didn't realize is that this would lead to more items
being returned as well. In the US, companies lost
$351 billion in sales in 2017 alone. Retailers are scrambling
to recover their losses. They try to place that returned item
online to be sold again, or they'll sell it to a discount partner or a liquidator. Basically, if companies cannot find
a place for this item quickly and economically, its place becomes the trash. Suddenly, I felt very guilty
for being that shopper, somebody who contributes to this. Who would have thought
my innocent shopping behavior would be hurting not only me, but our planet as well? And as I thought about what to do, I kept thinking: Why does the item have to be returned
to the retailer in the first place? What if there was another way, a win-win for everyone? What if when a person
is trying to return something, it could go to the next
shopper who wants it, and not the retailer? What if, instead of a return, they could do what I call a "green turn"? Consumers could use an app
to take pictures of the item and verify the condition
while returning it. Artificial intelligence systems could then
sort these clothes by condition -- mint condition or slightly used -- and direct it to the next
appropriate person. Mint-condition clothes could
automatically go to the next buyer, while slightly used clothes
could be marked down and offered online again. The retailer can decide the business rules on the number of times
a particular item can be resold. All that the consumer would need to do
is obtain a mobile code, take it to the nearest shipping place
to be packed and shipped, and off it goes from
one buyer to the next, not the landfill. Now you will ask, "Would people really
go through all this trouble?" I think they would if they had incentives, like loyalty points or cash back. Let's call it "green cash." There would be a whole
new opportunity to make money from this new customer base
looking to buy these returns. This system would make
a fun thing like shopping a spiritual experience that helps save our planet. (Applause) This is doable and would probably take six months
to weave some of our existing systems and run a pilot. Even before any of these
logistical systems are in place, each of us shoppers can act now, if every single adult in the US
made a few small changes to our shopping behavior. Take the extra time
to research and think -- Do I really need this item? No: Do I really want this item? -- before making a purchase. And if every one of us adults in the US returned five less items this year, we would keep 240 million pounds
of clothes out of the landfill. Six percent reduction, just like that. This environmental problem
that we have created is not thousands of years away; it's happening today, and must stop now to prevent growing
landfills across the globe. I want to leave my daughter
and my daughter's daughter a better and cleaner place
than I found it, so I have not only stopped overordering, I recycle religiously as well. And you can, too. It's not difficult. Before we fill our shopping carts
and our landfills with extra items that we don't want, let's pause next time
we are shopping online and think twice about what we all
hopefully really do want: a beautiful Earth to call home. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: If every adult in the US returned five fewer items per year, what would be the estimated reduction in clothing waste? 

However, this question does not directly ask about the pounds of clothes kept out of the landfill. A more similar question is Question 3: What is the estimated amount of returned clothing that ends up in landfills each year? But it doesn't match the "five fewer items" condition.

A question that combines these two aspects is not present in the generated MCQs, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of the "five fewer items" condition. Nonetheless, another question that has a similar intent and content is Question 3's sister question (not explicitly present), which would be the one asking about the pounds of clothes kept out of the landfill.

Since this question isn't explicitly present, but we know that if every adult in the US returned five fewer items per year, 240 million pounds of clothes would be kept out of the landfill (from the Ground Truth MCQ), we can look for a question that has 240 million pounds as an option.

In this case, Question 3 has an option D that says 240 million pounds, but it's asking about the total amount of returned clothing that ends up in landfills each year, not the reduction by returning five fewer items.

Given the above analysis, the closest match is not perfect, but Question 3 and Question 6 are the closest in terms of intent and content.

However, if I had to pick one, I would say that the closest match is Question 3's sister question, which isn't explicitly present. Since that's not an option, I will choose Question 3 as the closest match, with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Animated corpses appear
in stories all over the world throughout recorded history. But zombies have a distinct lineage— one that traces back 
to Equatorial and Central Africa. The first clue is in the word 
“zombie” itself. Its exact etymological origins 
are unknown, but there are several candidates. The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,
use the word “ndzumbi” for corpse. The Kikongo word “nzambi” refers
variously to the supreme being, an ancestor with superhuman abilities,
or another deity. And, in certain languages spoken
in Angola and the Congo, “zumbi” refers to an object inhabited 
by a spirit, or someone returned from the dead. There are also similarities
in certain cultural beliefs. For example, in Kongo tradition, 
it’s thought that once someone dies, their spirit can be housed 
in a physical object which might bring protection 
and good luck. Similar beliefs about what
might happen to someone’s soul after death are held 
in various parts of Africa. Between 1517 and 1804, France and Spain enslaved 
hundreds of thousands of African people, taking them to the Caribbean island that now contains Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. There, the religious beliefs 
of enslaved African people mixed with the Catholic traditions 
of colonial authorities and a religion known as “vodou” developed. According to some vodou beliefs, a 
person’s soul can be captured and stored, becoming a body-less “zombi.” Alternatively, if a body isn’t properly
attended to soon after death, a sorcerer called a “bokor”
can capture a corpse and turn it into a soulless zombi
that will perform their bidding. Historically, these zombis were said 
to be put to work as laborers who needed neither food nor rest 
and would enrich their captor’s fortune. In other words, zombification seemed 
to represent the horrors of enslavement that many Haitian people experienced. It was the worst possible fate: a form of enslavement that not even
death could free you from. The zombi was deprived of an afterlife
and trapped in eternal subjugation. Because of this, in Haitian culture, zombis are commonly seen as victims
deserving of sympathy and care. The zombie underwent a transformation
after the US occupation of Haiti began in 1915— this time, through the lens
of Western pop culture. During the occupation, US citizens
propagated many racist beliefs about Black Haitian people. Among false accounts
of devil worship and human sacrifice, zombie stories captured
the American imagination. And in 1932, zombies debuted
on the big screen in a film called “White Zombie.” Set in Haiti, the film’s protagonist 
must rescue his fiancée from an evil vodou master who runs 
a sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of
sympathy isn't the enslaved workforce, but the victimized white woman. Over the following decades, zombies
appeared in many American films, usually with loose references
to Haitian culture, though some veered off to involve
aliens and Nazis. Then came the wildly influential 1968 film
“Night of the Living Dead,” in which a group of strangers tries 
to survive an onslaught of slow-moving, flesh-eating monsters. The film’s director remarked that he never
envisioned his living dead as zombies. Instead, it was the audience who
recognized them as such. But from then on, zombies became linked
to an insatiable craving for flesh— with a particular taste for brains added
in 1985′s “The Return of the Living Dead.” In these and many subsequent films,
no sorcerer controls the zombies; they’re the monsters. And in many iterations, 
later fueled by 2002′s “28 Days Later,” zombification became 
a contagious phenomenon. For decades now, artists around the world
have used zombies to shine a light on the social ills 
and anxieties of their moment— from consumer culture to the global lack
of disaster preparedness. But, in effect, American pop culture also
initially erased the zombies origins— cannibalizing its original significance and transforming the victim 
into the monster.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not directly ask what zombification reminds Haitians of, it does ask about the perception of zombies in Haitian culture before the US occupation. The correct answer, "As victims deserving of sympathy and care," implies that zombification is associated with the horrors of enslavement, which is the underlying concept that the ground truth MCQ is trying to convey.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. This question asks about the primary influence on the development of the concept of zombies in the Caribbean, and the correct answer, "The combination of African traditions and the experience of enslavement," directly relates to the idea that zombification reminds Haitians of slavery.

But among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most similar in terms of question intent and content.

**Transcript**:
Animated corpses appear
in stories all over the world throughout recorded history. But zombies have a distinct lineage— one that traces back 
to Equatorial and Central Africa. The first clue is in the word 
“zombie” itself. Its exact etymological origins 
are unknown, but there are several candidates. The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,
use the word “ndzumbi” for corpse. The Kikongo word “nzambi” refers
variously to the supreme being, an ancestor with superhuman abilities,
or another deity. And, in certain languages spoken
in Angola and the Congo, “zumbi” refers to an object inhabited 
by a spirit, or someone returned from the dead. There are also similarities
in certain cultural beliefs. For example, in Kongo tradition, 
it’s thought that once someone dies, their spirit can be housed 
in a physical object which might bring protection 
and good luck. Similar beliefs about what
might happen to someone’s soul after death are held 
in various parts of Africa. Between 1517 and 1804, France and Spain enslaved 
hundreds of thousands of African people, taking them to the Caribbean island that now contains Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. There, the religious beliefs 
of enslaved African people mixed with the Catholic traditions 
of colonial authorities and a religion known as “vodou” developed. According to some vodou beliefs, a 
person’s soul can be captured and stored, becoming a body-less “zombi.” Alternatively, if a body isn’t properly
attended to soon after death, a sorcerer called a “bokor”
can capture a corpse and turn it into a soulless zombi
that will perform their bidding. Historically, these zombis were said 
to be put to work as laborers who needed neither food nor rest 
and would enrich their captor’s fortune. In other words, zombification seemed 
to represent the horrors of enslavement that many Haitian people experienced. It was the worst possible fate: a form of enslavement that not even
death could free you from. The zombi was deprived of an afterlife
and trapped in eternal subjugation. Because of this, in Haitian culture, zombis are commonly seen as victims
deserving of sympathy and care. The zombie underwent a transformation
after the US occupation of Haiti began in 1915— this time, through the lens
of Western pop culture. During the occupation, US citizens
propagated many racist beliefs about Black Haitian people. Among false accounts
of devil worship and human sacrifice, zombie stories captured
the American imagination. And in 1932, zombies debuted
on the big screen in a film called “White Zombie.” Set in Haiti, the film’s protagonist 
must rescue his fiancée from an evil vodou master who runs 
a sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of
sympathy isn't the enslaved workforce, but the victimized white woman. Over the following decades, zombies
appeared in many American films, usually with loose references
to Haitian culture, though some veered off to involve
aliens and Nazis. Then came the wildly influential 1968 film
“Night of the Living Dead,” in which a group of strangers tries 
to survive an onslaught of slow-moving, flesh-eating monsters. The film’s director remarked that he never
envisioned his living dead as zombies. Instead, it was the audience who
recognized them as such. But from then on, zombies became linked
to an insatiable craving for flesh— with a particular taste for brains added
in 1985′s “The Return of the Living Dead.” In these and many subsequent films,
no sorcerer controls the zombies; they’re the monsters. And in many iterations, 
later fueled by 2002′s “28 Days Later,” zombification became 
a contagious phenomenon. For decades now, artists around the world
have used zombies to shine a light on the social ills 
and anxieties of their moment— from consumer culture to the global lack
of disaster preparedness. But, in effect, American pop culture also
initially erased the zombies origins— cannibalizing its original significance and transforming the victim 
into the monster.

**Transcript**:
It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,
arrested her, and led her to the room
where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power
and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, 
claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most
turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries
first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power,
building businesses and claiming arable land 
that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility 
closely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries 
to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii 
as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business 
opportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar
to the US tariff-free— some of their descendants
shifted positions. They formed a political group 
known as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,
bringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born
into an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, 
ascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,
the emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting
where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king 
to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians 
of their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group
of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very 
persons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats 
and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined
to restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom 
had lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, 
she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, 
the so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted 
of many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense 
that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines
marched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” 
removed Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, 
“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”
declared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed 
that Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing
a new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, 
some of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds
and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani 
sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,
and they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs 
expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt
that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news
that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets
from the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed 
under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled
to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists
and over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress
to halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, 
the Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii 
as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared 
it a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating
Queen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning
for the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, 
and national liberation. When she died in 1917, 
these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced 
Queen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have 
peace and annexation the first thing to do 
is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left
a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people
never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight
in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,
Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give
the last drop of my blood.”

into an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, 
ascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,
the emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting
where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king 
to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians 
of their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group
of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very 
persons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats 
and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined
to restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom 
had lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, 
she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, 
the so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted 
of many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense 
that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines
marched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” 
removed Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, 
“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”
declared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed 
that Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing
a new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, 
some of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds
and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani 
sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,
and they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs 
expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt
that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news
that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets
from the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed 
under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled
to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists
and over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress
to halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, 
the Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii 
as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared 
it a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating
Queen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning
for the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, 
and national liberation. When she died in 1917, 
these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced 
Queen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have 
peace and annexation the first thing to do 
is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left
a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people
never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight
in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,
Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give
the last drop of my blood.”

**Transcript**:
It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,
arrested her, and led her to the room
where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power
and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, 
claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most
turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries
first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power,
building businesses and claiming arable land 
that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility 
closely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries 
to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii 
as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business 
opportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar
to the US tariff-free— some of their descendants
shifted positions. They formed a political group 
known as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,
bringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 only partially matches the ground truth MCQ, as it only mentions that the Bayonet Constitution "stripped Native Hawaiians of their rights and diminished the monarchy's power." It does not explicitly state that it took away voting rights for many native Hawaiians or that it was enacted by force.

A more comprehensive match would be a combination of Question 3 and Question 4, which mentions that two-thirds of Native Hawaiians lost their voting rights under the Bayonet Constitution.

But if I had to choose one question that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 3, as it is the only question that explicitly mentions the Bayonet Constitution and its impact on the monarchy's power and Native Hawaiian rights.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of Queen Liliʻuokalani's imprisonment in ʻIolani Palace, while the generated MCQs cover various other topics related to the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of Queen Liliʻuokalani's imprisonment, I would suggest Question 7, which mentions her trip to Washington, D.C. after being under house arrest. Nevertheless, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is vaguely related, I would say Question 7, with the understanding that it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: No match (or 7, with the caveat mentioned above)

**Transcript**:
It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,
arrested her, and led her to the room
where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power
and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, 
claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most
turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries
first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power,
building businesses and claiming arable land 
that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility 
closely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries 
to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii 
as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business 
opportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar
to the US tariff-free— some of their descendants
shifted positions. They formed a political group 
known as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,
bringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born
into an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, 
ascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,
the emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting
where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king 
to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians 
of their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group
of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very 
persons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats 
and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined
to restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom 
had lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, 
she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, 
the so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted 
of many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense 
that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines
marched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” 
removed Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, 
“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”
declared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed 
that Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing
a new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, 
some of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds
and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani 
sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,
and they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs 
expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt
that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news
that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets
from the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed 
under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled
to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists
and over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress
to halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, 
the Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii 
as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared 
it a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating
Queen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning
for the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, 
and national liberation. When she died in 1917, 
these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced 
Queen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have 
peace and annexation the first thing to do 
is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left
a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people
never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight
in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,
Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give
the last drop of my blood.”

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the event that Aloha ʻĀina patriots protested, and the correct answer is "None of the Above" (D). The transcript mentions that Aloha ʻĀina patriots protested the coup against Queen Lili’uokalani and the annexation of Hawaii.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the organization that staged the coup against Queen Lili’uokalani in 1893. However, it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6 (index 6). However, please note that it is not a direct match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the event that Aloha ʻĀina patriots protested, with options that include the correct answer.

**Transcript**:
What, you want my milkshake? Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares 
to make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr. 
delivers a speech. He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’
and a ‘monstrous scourge.’ He insists that ‘the extension 
of the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed 
in Missouri, or any new state.” Obviously. “Representative Tyler disagrees. He believes it is a state’s right 
to choose whether or not to allow slavery. He doesn’t think the federal government
can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.” Whaaaaat? “Senator Thomas proposes
what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along
with another state, Maine. Slavery will be allowed in Missouri
and prohibited in Maine. He also suggests drawing a line 
through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north 
of the line, and allowed south of it.” And this is where I have
to draw the line. That’s better. Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing
is fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly. The compromise is based 
on the middle ground fallacy. By saying that half of the new territories
should allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints,
pro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong,
while the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here:
the pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all, 
is to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those 
among you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor
of ending slavery. In response to your many contorted
arguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery 
is morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it
and many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved
other people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions
on this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention 
to this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences
in many situations. Failure to recognize the fact 
that a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible,
is also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless
injustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people—
which rest assured, I don’t mistake you for—
fall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise
as a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln 
was elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more
states threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery
in states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion 
into new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War
has broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved
with a compromise.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The addition of a slave state with a free state in the mid-1800s is an example of what kind of logical fallacy?

Question 2: What was the main point of Senator Thomas's proposed compromise regarding the admission of Missouri as a state? Options: A. To prohibit slavery in all new states, B.

That compromise is never the best solution, C. That some issues are too morally complex to be resolved through compromise, D. That compromise is only necessary in times of war Correct Option: C
Question 10: What is the transcript's view on the idea that compromise is a virtue unto itself? Options: A. That it is always true, B. That it is sometimes true, C. That it is a flawed assumption that can lead to perpetuating injustices, D. That it is irrelevant to the issue of slavery Correct Option: C

**Transcript**:
What, you want my milkshake? Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares 
to make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr. 
delivers a speech. He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’
and a ‘monstrous scourge.’ He insists that ‘the extension 
of the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed 
in Missouri, or any new state.” Obviously. “Representative Tyler disagrees. He believes it is a state’s right 
to choose whether or not to allow slavery. He doesn’t think the federal government
can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.” Whaaaaat? “Senator Thomas proposes
what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along
with another state, Maine. Slavery will be allowed in Missouri
and prohibited in Maine. He also suggests drawing a line 
through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north 
of the line, and allowed south of it.” And this is where I have
to draw the line. That’s better. Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing
is fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly. The compromise is based 
on the middle ground fallacy. By saying that half of the new territories
should allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints,
pro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong,
while the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here:
the pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all, 
is to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those 
among you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor
of ending slavery. In response to your many contorted
arguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery 
is morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it
and many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved
other people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions
on this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention 
to this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences
in many situations. Failure to recognize the fact 
that a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible,
is also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless
injustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people—
which rest assured, I don’t mistake you for—
fall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise
as a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln 
was elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more
states threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery
in states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion 
into new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War
has broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved

**Transcript**:
In 2007, researchers surveyed
over 180 teachers to understand if they held stereotypes
about students from three racial groups. The results surfaced several
negative stereotypes, labeling Black students
as aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish
and materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’
other biases, the most commonly held opinion
was that Asian students were significantly more industrious,
intelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem
like a good thing, or at least better than other,
negative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable
stereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount
of harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,
and even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians
is actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged
in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used
to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment
in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated
into American society. Former incarcerees were praised
as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,
“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story
of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”
incarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language
classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave
in white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid
returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies
and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded
that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage
to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected
traitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was
coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an
obedient and respectful “model minority." They also criticized so-called 
“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened
by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit
Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story
of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities
as inferior. This narrative put a wedge
between Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history
of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities
against each other. In doing so, the model minority myth
also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top
and everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe
the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,
might not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths
and weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups
meet certain standards— typically, standards set
by a white majority. In this case,
the model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups
who are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving
of tolerance, while groups that challenge
the status quo are not. This stereotype also negatively impacts
the Asian individuals it describes. According to a psychological phenomenon
known as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure
on their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative
group stereotypes. But this phenomenon can occur around
seemingly positive stereotypes as well. The pressure associated with living
up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice
when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs
catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less
support than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created
by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize
racially motivated violence and discrimination against
Asian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly
groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds
and unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label
might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works
like every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people
to a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability
to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals
within that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels
is essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating
harmful stereotypes for good.

**Transcript**:
In 2007, researchers surveyed
over 180 teachers to understand if they held stereotypes
about students from three racial groups. The results surfaced several
negative stereotypes, labeling Black students
as aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish
and materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’
other biases, the most commonly held opinion
was that Asian students were significantly more industrious,
intelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem
like a good thing, or at least better than other,
negative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable
stereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount
of harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,
and even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians
is actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged
in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used
to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment
in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated
into American society. Former incarcerees were praised
as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,
“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story
of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”
incarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language
classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave
in white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid
returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies
and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded
that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage
to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected
traitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was
coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an
obedient and respectful “model minority." They also criticized so-called 
“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened
by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit
Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story
of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities
as inferior. This narrative put a wedge
between Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history
of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities
against each other. In doing so, the model minority myth
also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top
and everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe
the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,
might not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths
and weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups
meet certain standards— typically, standards set
by a white majority. In this case,
the model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups
who are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving
of tolerance, while groups that challenge
the status quo are not. This stereotype also negatively impacts
the Asian individuals it describes. According to a psychological phenomenon
known as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure
on their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative
group stereotypes. But this phenomenon can occur around
seemingly positive stereotypes as well. The pressure associated with living
up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice
when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs
catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less
support than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created
by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize
racially motivated violence and discrimination against
Asian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly
groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds
and unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label
might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works
like every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people
to a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability
to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals
within that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels
is essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating
harmful stereotypes for good.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since the ground truth MCQ asks about a specific stereotype of Asian students, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, as it talks about the impact of the "model minority" stereotype on Asian individuals, which is related to the stereotypes mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

But, if I were to choose a question that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match exactly. The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific stereotype of Asian students, whereas the generated MCQs ask about the "model minority" stereotype in general.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, with an index of 6. However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2007, researchers surveyed
over 180 teachers to understand if they held stereotypes
about students from three racial groups. The results surfaced several
negative stereotypes, labeling Black students
as aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish
and materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’
other biases, the most commonly held opinion
was that Asian students were significantly more industrious,
intelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem
like a good thing, or at least better than other,
negative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable
stereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount
of harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,
and even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians
is actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged
in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used
to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment
in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated
into American society. Former incarcerees were praised
as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,
“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story
of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”
incarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language
classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave
in white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid
returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies
and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded
that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage
to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected
traitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was
coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an
obedient and respectful “model minority." They also criticized so-called 
“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened
by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit
Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story
of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities
as inferior. This narrative put a wedge
between Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history
of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities
against each other. In doing so, the model minority myth
also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top
and everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe
the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,
might not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths
and weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups
meet certain standards— typically, standards set
by a white majority. In this case,
the model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups
who are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving
of tolerance, while groups that challenge
the status quo are not. This stereotype also negatively impacts
the Asian individuals it describes. According to a psychological phenomenon
known as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure
on their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative
group stereotypes. But this phenomenon can occur around
seemingly positive stereotypes as well. The pressure associated with living
up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice
when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs
catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less
support than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created
by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize
racially motivated violence and discrimination against
Asian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly
groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds
and unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label
might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works
like every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people
to a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability
to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals
within that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels
is essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating
harmful stereotypes for good.

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So in one of the last episodes, I introduced you to a legend with a longbow. He's from my hometown and his name is Byron Ferguson. He shot an aspirin out of the air in slow-motion. But there's something that happened in the arrow I didn't understand. It was deflecting and it has something to do with what's called the "archer's paradox". What do you think, Byron? - "The archer's paradox is the demon for all archers, but there are ways to work around it." Not bad! Alright, so today on Smarter Every Day, we're gonna understand how an arrow deflects and what's called the "archer's paradox". A paradox is a situation involving two things with a contradictory nature. So what is the archer's paradox? What are the two things an archer has to deconflict? My friend John explained it to me like this. Let's pretend that this pecan tree is the bow and this is the line of our bowstring. If we take an arrow and we put it into our bow and we draw the bow back, and we're trying to hit that target over there, watch what happens. As we release the bowstring and it travels closer to the bow - look at that -, the fact that the bow is sitting here in our way between us and the target, causes the arrow to point off in a different direction. So how can we possibly hit that target, when our arrow is pointed over there? This is the archer's paradox, because we know they actually do hit targets like that. Toy designers are cheaters: they don't deal with the paradox, they just get around it. For example, the guy who designed this suction cup bow, he doesn't go around the handle, straight through the middle. Check that out! Whoever designed this crossbow, instead of being in line with the bow itself, the string is offset by this big rail. That way, the string is always pushing along the dart. So how does a longbow shooter get around this problem? Here's how: they don't have a completely rigid arrow like that, they have a bendable arrow like this. See when it vibrates? You can see these nodal points? That's important. Check this out. As we put this real arrow into the bow here and we shoot, as we go towards the bow, the fact that we're accelerating this arrow causes it to build strain energy, causing this big curvature. That curvature then snaps back in the other direction once it bends to a certain point and look what we have. We have the arrow bending around the bow. When we release, it does something cool. It snakes around the bow, just like this and you're able to fly all the way to the target. So the archer's paradox is the fact that you have a bow in between you and the target and you're still able to get around the bow. "The first that happens, is the arrow bends from the pressure of the string and the front arrow being against the riser of the bow. As it leaves the bow, or has already cleared the bow, it bends in the opposite direction. When those two cross, determines where the arrow will fly. One hundred percent of the time, the arrow will fly where these two points are crossed, are pointed. Whereas if this one had been here, then the arrow's gonna fly to the left. If it was here, the arrow flies off to the right. We want those two lined up to go straight to the target." - "Gotcha. So the fact that it bends, helps it get around the arrow rest without going off in an angle, as if it were a straight line." - "Correct." - "You're pushing the string straight towards the handle, but somehow it makes it around the handle." - "Right." - "Yeah, and the bends is how it does that?" - "That's correct." Alright, my buddy Sander actually shoots with a compound bow. You don't do any of that longbow stuff, right? - "I have one, but I'm not really good at it." - "Alright, so what's the deal here?" - "So a compound, there's a whole lot more going on on a compound. There are more things that can go wrong, too, but there are several advantages if they're working." - "Yeah." - "So a compound, you see that's it cut out in the middle, you get this -" - "Oh, so the riser's not stout, is that what you're saying?" - "Yes, so the arrow is travelling straight, it doesn't have to go around a riser." - "Okay." - "And many people shoot also a drop-away rest, so it's gonna drop down. Whenever you pull the  bow back. a string attached to one of the bowstrings, pulls the rest up -" - "Nice!" "- centers your arrow, if you have it lined all up and square, your arrow is nice and level and then when you shoot, that arrow would dr- the rest would drop away -" - "Well, shoot it, shoot it. Let's do it. Oh no, wait, let me zoom in." "Hold on, so I'm looking at that rest, it's gonna fall away, right? - "Real fast!" - "Okay I'm ready. Dude, that is super fast. So is the arrow touching the rest as it goes through?" - "A little bit." - "Really?" - "'Cause it drops but it's not, I mean, immediate, it's down before the arrow passes it." - "So the goal here is, you don't have to bend around the riser, but I bet the arrow still bends, though?" - "It does bend and that's actually important in the straightness of the arrow flight." Isn't that interesting?But something else is going on here. Byron Ferguson is able to predict the wobbling of that arrow so good, that he's able to hit an aspirin tablet with a vibrating arrow, just like that. So one of two things is going on. Either a) he knows some science that we don't; or b) he's a warlock and this is all black magic. - "Okay, the stiffness of an arrow is called the spine, right? And so the spine is what, Byron?" - "The stiffness of the arrow." - "Oh, right! So this is your spine tester?" - "This is the spine tester, set up right now to test the flexion of a carbon arrow." - "Okay." - "So we actually have a two pound weight and the arrow's suspended at 26 inches. That's for carbon." - "Okay." - "And we read the inside of the scale here, to see how much it deflects." - "So you, you test all of your arrows before you shoot, so that you can normalize the paradox?" - "Correct, I want all the arrows to have the same stiffness." - "And that's how you're able to hit things like an aspirin?" - "That's part of it, yes." -"There's a little bit of skill. If it's out of tolerance, you just don't even put it in your quiver?" - "That's what those are." - "Really? Really? You've just a got a box of stuff that you don't shoot?" - "Yeah, they're too far out of tolerance." - "Really? That's amazing. So, people were asking in the last video - that arrow was deflecting so much -, they're saying "How do you time that?" and the way you time that, is you know the exact spine of the arrow." - "Correct." - "That's awesome. This is pretty good information.So this isn't black magic, this is science?" - "Correct." - "That's awesome." Byron is using science to normalize the wobble of his arrows. But less it been, there's a little bit of wizardry here, right? Because of the certain distance from his bow, he still has to know which side of the arrow that wobble's gonna be on. And then he has to line that up with an aspirin tablet. So this is a pretty good shot. In order to fully appreciate this trick shot, I'm gonna do a trick shot of my own, using the Phantom Miro. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, it was sponsored by Harrys.com. Harry's makes subscription razors, that are really high-quality. They end up being about the same price the old razors I used to use So, I have no need for my old razors, so Byron's gonna help me get rid of it. If you're interested in getting a Harry's razor - I actually shaved with one today -, go to Harrys.com and use the promocode "Smarter". - "What are you gonna try?" - "I'm gonna try to hit it down in here, around the neck part." - "Get it of it that way?" - "Cut its head off." - "Excellent. Alright, I'm gonna film this with the Phantom v711. I hope you hit it, this would be awesome! You did it! Like, I thought you would do it, but you did it! That's the first shot, Byron!" - "Luckily!" - "Whatever, man!" Alright, there you go. So, if you want to support Smarter Every Day, go to Harrys.com, use the promocode "Smarter", get you a discount on some razors. Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day, please considering subscribing and thank you as always, Byron. - "Can I get some Harry's razors, too?" - "You can!" I'm Destin, you get smarter every day, have a good one - he actually that! BEEP - "You make your own arrowheads, right?" - "Uh no, I designed the head, it's actually made in Austria. This is what called a destructive test." - "Holy cow, it didn't break, man! It didn't break! It didn't break! - "Did you think it would do that?" - "I was hoping for it."

**Transcript**:
There are no blue tigers. No blue bats, no blue squirrels, or blue dogs. Even blue whales aren’t that blue. Animals come in pretty much every color, but
blue seems to be the rarest. What’s cool, though, is when we do find
a blue animal, they’re awesome looking. Nature doesn’t do halfway with blue. To understand why this is, we’re gonna journey
through evolution, chemistry, and some very cool physics. But, first we’re gonna need to understand
why animals are any color at all, and to do that, we need to go look at some butterflies…
because butterflies are awesome… and if you don’t think so, you’re wrong This is Bob Robbins. He’s curator of Lepidoptera at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. Butterflies ARE awesome. Make no mistake about it. They’re a group of moths that evolved to
be active during the day, and if you’re active during the day, you have an advantage:
You can use light to communicate. You probably realize this, but out of all insects, butterflies display the brightest and most detailed patterns. And there’s a good reason for that: The colors in butterfly wings deliver messages,
like “I’m toxic”, or “I’m a male and this is my territory”, but not all butterfly
colors are created equal. If we zoom way in on a butterfly wing, we
see the colors come from tiny scales. It’s actually how moths and butterflies
get their scientific name. Oranges, reds, yellows browns…those scales
all contain pigments, organic molecules that absorb every color except what we see. Black scales absorb all colors. Animals, from butterflies to birds to you
and me, don’t make these pigments from scratch, they’re made from ingredients in our diet. You might know this thanks to flamingos: They’re
born gray, but turn pink thanks to pigments called carotenoids in crustaceans they eat. So when it comes to these colors: You are
what you eat. But not so for blue. Blue is *different* If you move the camera, you can see that the
color changes as you move the camera. It does. It’s like a hologram thing. This is because there’s no blue pigment
in these butterflies Wait… so they’re blue, but they’re not
really blue? That’s correct! Yes. You’re lying to me butterflies! These are Blue Morpho butterflies, maybe the prettiest butterflies of all. I mean… they did make it the butterfly emoji. The blue color isn’t from a pigment. The blue comes from the shape of the wing
scale itself, and when I learned how this works, it kinda blew my mind. If we zoom way in on a blue wing scale, we
see these little ridges. If we slice across the scale, and look closer,
we see those ridges are shaped like tiny Christmas trees. The arrangement of the branches is what gives
Morpho wings their blue color. When light comes in, some bounces off the
top surface. But some light passes into the layer and reflects
off the bottom surface. For most colors of light, waves reflecting
from the top and bottom will be out of phase, they’ll be canceled out, and that light
is removed. But blue light has just the right wavelength:
the reflected light waves are in sync, and that color makes it to our eye. This hall of mirrors only lets blue light
escape. There’s even a pigment at the base that
absorbs stray red and green light to make the blue even more pure. That’s how we get this awesome iridescent
blue. The microscopic structure of the wing itself. All of this happens because of the way light
bends when it moves from air into another material. So if we fill all those tiny gaps with something
other than air, like alcohol, the blue disappears. Technically, this “changes the index of
refraction”, but in plain English that means blue light is no longer bent the right way. The microscopic light filter is broken. Until the alcohol evaporates. And the color returns. But these butterflies live in the rainforest. You think they’d lose their color any time
they got wet, right? Well watch this. These wing scales are made of a material that’s
naturally water-resistant. What about this blue jay feather? If we look through it, the color completely
disappears. No blue pigment. Each feather bristle contains light-scattering
microscopic beads, spaced so everything but blue light is canceled out. Unlike the highly-ordered structures we find
in butterfly wings, these feather structures are more messy, like a foam, so instead of
changing as we move, the color’s more even from every direction. Peacock tail feathers? Again it’s the shape of the feather, not
pigment. But the light reflecting structures here are
more ordered, like a crystal, so it’s brighter from certain angles. There’s even a monkey–WHOA let’s keep
this PG!!–even that color is made by the adding and subtracting of light waves thanks
to structures in the skin… not pigment. And yes, even your blue eyes, are colored
by structures, not pigments. Outside of the ocean, almost exclusively,
the bluest living things make their colors with microscopic structures, and each one’s
a little different. No vertebrate, not a single bird or mammal
or reptile that we know of, makes a blue pigment on its body. In fact, there’s only one known butterfly
that has cracked the code for making a true blue pigment. Blue as a pigment in nature is incredibly
rare. But there’s one exception so far that we
know about, and these are over here called the olivewings. They have evolved a blue pigment. They’re not very common and we don’t know
much about them, and I don’t know of any other blue pigment. That’s a really special butterfly. Why is almost all of nature’s blue made
from structures and not pigments like everything else? I’ve asked this question to several scientists
that study color, and here’s their best theory so far: At some point way back in time,
birds and butterflies evolved the ability to see blue light. But they hadn’t yet evolved a way to paint
their bodies that color. But if they could, it’d be like going from
early Beatles to Sgt. Pepper’s Beatles. it meant new opportunities for communicating
and survival. Creating some blue pigment–out of the blue–would
have required inventing new chemistry, and there was no way to just add that recipe to
their genes. It was much easier for evolution to change
the shape of their bodies, ever so slightly, at the most microscopic level, and create
blue using physics instead. They solved a biology problem with engineering. What I love about this is these colors have
fascinated curious people for hundreds of years. After looking at peacock feathers through
one of the first microscopes back in the 1600’s Robert Hooke wrote:
“these colours are onely fantastical ones” Even Isaac Newton noticed there was something
unusual about these blues, and scientists have been studying it ever since. Not only because the science is interesting,

**Transcript**:
There are no blue tigers. No blue bats, no blue squirrels, or blue dogs. Even blue whales aren’t that blue. Animals come in pretty much every color, but
blue seems to be the rarest. What’s cool, though, is when we do find
a blue animal, they’re awesome looking. Nature doesn’t do halfway with blue. To understand why this is, we’re gonna journey
through evolution, chemistry, and some very cool physics. But, first we’re gonna need to understand
why animals are any color at all, and to do that, we need to go look at some butterflies…
because butterflies are awesome… and if you don’t think so, you’re wrong This is Bob Robbins. He’s curator of Lepidoptera at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. Butterflies ARE awesome. Make no mistake about it. They’re a group of moths that evolved to
be active during the day, and if you’re active during the day, you have an advantage:
You can use light to communicate. You probably realize this, but out of all insects, butterflies display the brightest and most detailed patterns. And there’s a good reason for that: The colors in butterfly wings deliver messages,
like “I’m toxic”, or “I’m a male and this is my territory”, but not all butterfly
colors are created equal. If we zoom way in on a butterfly wing, we
see the colors come from tiny scales. It’s actually how moths and butterflies
get their scientific name. Oranges, reds, yellows browns…those scales
all contain pigments, organic molecules that absorb every color except what we see. Black scales absorb all colors. Animals, from butterflies to birds to you
and me, don’t make these pigments from scratch, they’re made from ingredients in our diet. You might know this thanks to flamingos: They’re
born gray, but turn pink thanks to pigments called carotenoids in crustaceans they eat. So when it comes to these colors: You are
what you eat. But not so for blue. Blue is *different* If you move the camera, you can see that the
color changes as you move the camera. It does. It’s like a hologram thing. This is because there’s no blue pigment
in these butterflies Wait… so they’re blue, but they’re not
really blue? That’s correct! Yes. You’re lying to me butterflies! These are Blue Morpho butterflies, maybe the prettiest butterflies of all. I mean… they did make it the butterfly emoji. The blue color isn’t from a pigment. The blue comes from the shape of the wing
scale itself, and when I learned how this works, it kinda blew my mind. If we zoom way in on a blue wing scale, we
see these little ridges. If we slice across the scale, and look closer,
we see those ridges are shaped like tiny Christmas trees. The arrangement of the branches is what gives
Morpho wings their blue color. When light comes in, some bounces off the
top surface. But some light passes into the layer and reflects
off the bottom surface. For most colors of light, waves reflecting
from the top and bottom will be out of phase, they’ll be canceled out, and that light
is removed. But blue light has just the right wavelength:
the reflected light waves are in sync, and that color makes it to our eye. This hall of mirrors only lets blue light
escape. There’s even a pigment at the base that
absorbs stray red and green light to make the blue even more pure. That’s how we get this awesome iridescent
blue. The microscopic structure of the wing itself. All of this happens because of the way light
bends when it moves from air into another material. So if we fill all those tiny gaps with something
other than air, like alcohol, the blue disappears. Technically, this “changes the index of
refraction”, but in plain English that means blue light is no longer bent the right way. The microscopic light filter is broken. Until the alcohol evaporates. And the color returns. But these butterflies live in the rainforest. You think they’d lose their color any time

you've likely heard about the effects that climate change is having on our planet and specifically in the Arctic which is warming twice as fast but what would actually happen if all the ice melted on Earth I can help with that when you and I drink water we drink nons salty water we drink fresh water now of all the water in the world most of it is salty just 3% is not salty now of that 3% you can't get to most of that because 70% of that 3% is Frozen 30 million cubic kilomet of Frozen water it's so much frozen water so much ice that if you had a layer of it 1,000 M thick it would cover North America that's a lot of Frozen water people on land frozen water forms glaciers ice sheets Perma frost and snow but the Arctic is largely ocean so there it takes the form of floating sea ice like icebergs and because it's in direct contact with warming Waters sea ice will be the the first to melt as global temperatures rise in fact this year NASA reported that the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for January February April May and June 2016 so the world is getting warmer and the ice is melting pretty soon you'll be able to drive your ship from Europe to Russia right over the North Pole with no ice in the way that that's good for certain shipping companies maybe but for the marine species the polar bears the walruses the seals they don't have their old habitats they're all going away they're melting out from under them and ocean dwelling animals like boohead whales and narwhals aren't immune to these changes either as sea ice melts energy and oil companies are taking it as an opportunity to search further north for untapped resources using a process known as seismic blasting they shoot air explosions into the water in an effort to map the ocean floor and find oil of course this has detrimental effects on the whole ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean while also causing physical trauma and habitat relocation in whales in terms of sea levels melting sea ice won't have much of an effect this is because the floating ice already displaces roughly the same amount of water as it would produce when it melts so the net effect would be negligible furthermore the majority of Earth's ice more than 95% is landbased and contained mostly in enormous ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica where there are entire mountain ranges almost as big as the Alps completely buried in ice so what if all the ice on land melts if all this ice melts the ocean's going to have more water in it so the sea levels as measured from the coasts is going to go up it's

feedback mechanism one thing leading to another as the world gets warmer the ice melts as the ice melts it's reflecting less sunlight into space which lets the world get warmer still the sunlight is absorbed by the dark liquid ocean so as the ice melts the world gets warmer and the Sea gets fresher currently the world's oceans are crisscrossed by a set of currents that act like a giant conveyor belt and these currents are powered in part by the differences in the saltiness between one part of the ocean and another so if a melting II in Greenland dumps a whole bunch of non-s salty freshwater

you've likely heard about the effects that climate change is having on our planet and specifically in the Arctic which is warming twice as fast but what would actually happen if all the ice melted on

get to most of that because 70% of that 3% is Frozen 30 million cubic kilomet of Frozen water it's so much frozen water so much ice that if you had a layer of it 1,000 M thick it would cover North America that's a lot of Frozen water people on land frozen water forms glaciers ice sheets Perma frost and snow but the Arctic is largely ocean so there it takes the form of floating sea ice like icebergs and because it's in direct contact with warming Waters sea ice will be the the first to melt as global temperatures rise in fact this year NASA reported that the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for January February April May and June 2016 so the world is getting warmer and the ice is melting pretty soon you'll be able to drive your ship from Europe to Russia right over the North Pole with no ice in the way that that's good for certain shipping companies maybe but for the marine species the polar bears the walruses the seals they don't have their old habitats they're all going away they're melting out from under them and ocean dwelling animals like boohead whales and narwhals aren't immune to these changes either as sea ice melts energy and oil companies are taking it as an opportunity to search further north for untapped resources using a process known as seismic blasting they shoot air explosions into the water in an effort to map the ocean floor and find oil of course this has detrimental effects on the whole ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean while also causing physical trauma and habitat relocation in whales in terms of sea levels melting sea ice won't have much of an effect this is because the floating ice already displaces roughly the same amount of water as it would produce when it melts so the net effect would be negligible furthermore the majority of Earth's ice more than 95% is landbased and contained mostly in enormous ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica where there are entire mountain ranges almost as big as the Alps

**Transcript**:
[ ♪ intro ] Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that writers
give so many superheroes, alien beings, and magical creatures the power of telepathy. Just imagine what you could learn about a
person if you could hear their thoughts. Well, actually, I’ve just made a bit of
an assumption there: that there’d be something to hear. Because not everyone has that kind of internal
monologue—or, what psychologists often  refer to as inner speech. And even people who do hear their thoughts
don’t necessarily talk in their heads 247. It turns out that inner speech could tell
us a lot about how our brains work, how they develop, and how we speak. But… research on all this is really just
getting started. Inner speech is somewhat loosely defined as
when a person “speaks” meaningful thoughts without producing sound or moving any part
of their body, like their tongue or their lips. Though, in some ways, it’s easier to define
by what it isn’t. It’s different from visualizing or picturing
things in your head. And it doesn’t include feelings like happiness
or hunger, or your awareness of sensory experiences, like noticing the glint of something shiny
on the ground. So basically, it only refers to thoughts accompanied
by specific words. These words usually have the same tone, inflection,
and even accent that they would if were spoken aloud—though not always, which we’ll get
to in a bit. Even figuring that much out about inner speech
was somewhat of a challenge for psychologists, because—surprise!—it’s really hard to
measure people’s internal experiences. So there’s been a lot of variation in research
methods, and not a lot of agreement between different studies and different scientists. For example, some studies have tried to see
inside people’s heads by prompting them to hear specific words or phrases in their
mind—like, by asking them to read something silently or determine if two words rhyme without
saying them out loud. That’s revealed some weird quirks about
inner speech—like that, when people read, they’re actually much more likely to mentally
say single words that represent a passage than every word of every sentence. But prompted inner speech and spontaneous
inner speech aren’t really the same. Plus, prompts can't tell us much about how
frequently or why people use inner speech in their daily life. So, some researchers use questionnaires instead. According to those, these conversations we
have with ourselves are generally about... ourselves. And kind of in a bad way. Most of the time, our inner speech consists
of negative things about ourselves, our negative emotions, or us trying to decide if we’re
good enough. And, weirdly enough, that’s all usually
in full sentences. Only about one-third of people experience
abbreviated inner speech, where a single word or phrase represents an entire complex thought. So… the opposite of what happens when we
read. Questionnaires have also tried to get at the
question of how often people engage in inner speech, but they have a few limitations. Perhaps the most glaring is that people generally
aren’t great at being aware of their inner experiences, so questionnaires probably overestimate
the frequency of inner speech. More recently, researchers have started using
a procedure called Descriptive Experience Sampling, or DES instead. With DES, people carry a beeper that goes
off randomly throughout the day. And when it does, they write down some notes
about exactly what was going on in their  head at that moment. It’s like when you’re sitting across from
your friend and you’re like “what ya thinking about?” It’s not perfect. Some researchers think that DES goes too far
and underestimates inner speech, for example. But it is giving scientists a better sense
of how many people “hear” their thoughts and how often. And it’s revealed that inner monologues—like
most things in psychology—are on a spectrum. Very few people have no inner speech at all,
and very few people engage in it one hundred percent of the time. DES studies suggest that seventy to eighty-five
percent of people experience some kind of spontaneous inner speech at least occasionally. And of those people, most of them are talking
to themselves about fifteen to thirty percent of the time. It’s also possible to have more than one
internal experience simultaneously, so you might be visualizing something and talking
to yourself about it. And inner speech varies in other ways, too. While a lot of people talk about this in terms
of internal monologues, about seventy-five percent of people report that sometimes they’re
having back-and-forths in their head. They usually play both parts in the conversation,
though—only about twenty-five percent of people report that other people show up in
their inner speech. People who have ever had an imaginary friend
are more likely to use this kind of dialogic speech, even if they don’t have that friend
anymore. Which is pretty cute. Others might experience something a little
different but similar: what psychologists call imagined interactions. Basically, that’s when you imagine all the
things you should have said to that guy who stole your parking spot, or rehearse what
you’re going to say to your date later. What’s not clear in all of this is why people
have different inner monologues or dialogues, and what those differences say about them. We don’t even really know where inner speech
comes from. From an evolutionary standpoint, many experts
think that inner speech came about as part of the process for generating overt speech. It may even be a side effect of sorts of spoken
language that’s been co-opted for other cognitive tasks. See, when you go to speak, your brain simultaneously
sends signals to two different areas: one to motor parts of the brain to control the
mouth and the tongue and stuff, and a copy to the sensory parts of the brain. The sensory signal allows the brain to make
a prediction about what it’s about to hear. Essentially, you recite words in your head
as you say them out loud. And it turns out that same kind of signal
occurs during inner speech. That may be why you can quote “hear” yourself—you’re
literally activating the hearing part of your brain. And some psychologists think this means the
underlying purpose of internal speech is to catch errors when you talk. If the internal prediction matches what you
say, your brain knows it can filter your words out of what it’s hearing and focus on the
rest of the sounds coming in. If they don’t match—like if you stumble
over a word—your brain lets you know that you made a mistake so that you can stop and
correct yourself. But it doesn’t seem like this error correction
is absolutely essential for speech, because the two can be separated from one another. There are cases of people with brain damage
who lose their inner speech but not the ability to talk, and vice versa. Still, inner speech could have helped people
communicate better, which could explain why it evolved. This is just the prevailing hypothesis, though,
and it’s possible it’s wrong. Also, it’s likely that even if inner speech
started this way, the brain has repurposed it for other uses. Those other uses might explain why it differs
between people. Some psychologists think our everyday inner
speech reflects conversations that we had out loud as kids—especially moments when
our caregivers talked us through solving a problem or calmed us down. The idea is that these teaching moments get
internalized as we grow up, and then we essentially replay them in our heads later—which would
explain why inner speech often resembles  a conversation. And, this could explain why, content-wise,
it’s often about self-regulation—things like problem-solving, planning things out,
time management, and motivation. Those are all things someone would help talk
their young child through. Plus, the same brain areas are activated during
internal dialogic speech and when a person is thinking about someone else’s experience
and perspective. That would make sense if the voice in your
head is basically your brain recycling someone else’s words. So, if this theory is correct, inner speech
might be different between people simply because their upbringings and social interactions
were different. We still don’t know how or if those differences
matter, mind you. But there are some big clues that inner speech
plays an important role in cognition—so, all those brain processes involved in thinking. For instance, scientists have used a test
called a dual-task paradigm to see how inner speech affects problem solving. Basically, they ask the person to solve a
problem while doing something else. And if that second task is physical—like,
tapping their foot—they generally have no problem with it. But if it’s verbal—like, remembering a
list of words—then they perform worse. Researchers think that’s because those words
disrupt their inner speech, making it so they can’t really talk themselves through the
problem. Inner speech may also be an important tool
for memory, and more specifically, working memory. That’s the memory where you store the information
you want to access really quickly. One of the components in working memory is
the ability to repeat information to yourself until you no longer need it—and for that,
you need inner speech. In fact, people who do more self-managing
inner speech—so, things like talking themselves through solving a problem—do seem to do
better on some cognitive tasks. So differences in how people talk to themselves
might underlie differences in how well they perform different kinds of thinking. Inner speech may also play a part in mental
health conditions. Research has connected it to depression and
anxiety, for example. People who have more depressive tendencies
tend to experience more depressive self-talk. And we know that people who are more anxious
tend to engage in more self-critical inner speech. It’s not clear if these negative forms of
inner speech exacerbate or even cause those conditions, or if the conditions lead to higher
amounts of negative inner speech. Though, studies have found that if you ask
people to think verbally about hypothetical situations—even positive ones—their mood
is lower than if you ask them to picture the hypothetical situations instead. And that does support the idea that the speech
part of inner speech might make people less happy… for some reason. Other research has tied inner speech to symptoms
common in psychotic disorders. For example, people with schizophrenia often
report hearing voices of people speaking to them or telling them what to do. One theory is that those “voices” are
actually inner speech. Remember that prediction signal I mentioned
earlier? Well, some experts think that if something
in that neural circuit is off, then the brain’s usual way of identifying self-made sounds
and thoughts could be off, too. So basically, that person’s brain might
not be so great at separating sounds they generate from ones they hear. And that may mean it also attributes inner
speech to someone else. Because of these potentially important roles
in cognition and mental health, psychologists are eager to gain a better understanding of
what inner speech is and why it happens. And figuring all that out could tell us a
lot about, well, a lot—from how our brains develop and work to what’s actually happening
in a variety of mental disorders. But as of right now, we just don’t know
that much about this thing most of us do every day. There are a lot of big questions currently
unanswered, like where inner speech comes from, why it differs between people, and what
those differences mean. Like, can you change your inner monologue? Can you train yourself to think in conversations,
or to hear other voices or your own more often? We don’t even know if you should want to
make those changes—if there are the benefits or downsides of different kinds of inner speech. And it’s probably going to be a while before
we have any clear answers, because our methods for studying it just aren’t great, and there’s
a lot of debate over basic questions, like how many people even do it in the first place. In the meantime, though, you can still talk
about it amongst yourself. Thanks to Eric for asking us about this topic,

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[ ♪ intro ] Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that writers
give so many superheroes, alien beings, and magical creatures the power of telepathy. Just imagine what you could learn about a
person if you could hear their thoughts. Well, actually, I’ve just made a bit of
an assumption there: that there’d be something to hear. Because not everyone has that kind of internal
monologue—or, what psychologists often  refer to as inner speech. And even people who do hear their thoughts
don’t necessarily talk in their heads 247. It turns out that inner speech could tell
us a lot about how our brains work, how they develop, and how we speak. But… research on all this is really just
getting started. Inner speech is somewhat loosely defined as
when a person “speaks” meaningful thoughts without producing sound or moving any part
of their body, like their tongue or their lips. Though, in some ways, it’s easier to define
by what it isn’t. It’s different from visualizing or picturing
things in your head. And it doesn’t include feelings like happiness
or hunger, or your awareness of sensory experiences, like noticing the glint of something shiny
on the ground. So basically, it only refers to thoughts accompanied
by specific words. These words usually have the same tone, inflection,
and even accent that they would if were spoken aloud—though not always, which we’ll get
to in a bit. Even figuring that much out about inner speech
was somewhat of a challenge for psychologists, because—surprise!—it’s really hard to
measure people’s internal experiences. So there’s been a lot of variation in research
methods, and not a lot of agreement between different studies and different scientists. For example, some studies have tried to see
inside people’s heads by prompting them to hear specific words or phrases in their
mind—like, by asking them to read something silently or determine if two words rhyme without
saying them out loud. That’s revealed some weird quirks about
inner speech—like that, when people read, they’re actually much more likely to mentally
say single words that represent a passage than every word of every sentence. But prompted inner speech and spontaneous
inner speech aren’t really the same. Plus, prompts can't tell us much about how
frequently or why people use inner speech in their daily life. So, some researchers use questionnaires instead. According to those, these conversations we
have with ourselves are generally about... ourselves. And kind of in a bad way. Most of the time, our inner speech consists
of negative things about ourselves, our negative emotions, or us trying to decide if we’re
good enough. And, weirdly enough, that’s all usually
in full sentences. Only about one-third of people experience
abbreviated inner speech, where a single word or phrase represents an entire complex thought. So… the opposite of what happens when we
read. Questionnaires have also tried to get at the
question of how often people engage in inner speech, but they have a few limitations. Perhaps the most glaring is that people generally
aren’t great at being aware of their inner experiences, so questionnaires probably overestimate
the frequency of inner speech. More recently, researchers have started using
a procedure called Descriptive Experience Sampling, or DES instead. With DES, people carry a beeper that goes
off randomly throughout the day. And when it does, they write down some notes
about exactly what was going on in their  head at that moment. It’s like when you’re sitting across from
your friend and you’re like “what ya thinking about?” It’s not perfect. Some researchers think that DES goes too far
and underestimates inner speech, for example. But it is giving scientists a better sense
of how many people “hear” their thoughts and how often. And it’s revealed that inner monologues—like
most things in psychology—are on a spectrum. Very few people have no inner speech at all,
and very few people engage in it one hundred percent of the time. DES studies suggest that seventy to eighty-five
percent of people experience some kind of spontaneous inner speech at least occasionally. And of those people, most of them are talking
to themselves about fifteen to thirty percent of the time. It’s also possible to have more than one
internal experience simultaneously, so you might be visualizing something and talking
to yourself about it. And inner speech varies in other ways, too. While a lot of people talk about this in terms
of internal monologues, about seventy-five percent of people report that sometimes they’re
having back-and-forths in their head. They usually play both parts in the conversation,
though—only about twenty-five percent of people report that other people show up in
their inner speech. People who have ever had an imaginary friend
are more likely to use this kind of dialogic speech, even if they don’t have that friend
anymore. Which is pretty cute. Others might experience something a little
different but similar: what psychologists call imagined interactions. Basically, that’s when you imagine all the
things you should have said to that guy who stole your parking spot, or rehearse what
you’re going to say to your date later. What’s not clear in all of this is why people
have different inner monologues or dialogues, and what those differences say about them. We don’t even really know where inner speech
comes from. From an evolutionary standpoint, many experts
think that inner speech came about as part of the process for generating overt speech. It may even be a side effect of sorts of spoken
language that’s been co-opted for other cognitive tasks. See, when you go to speak, your brain simultaneously
sends signals to two different areas: one to motor parts of the brain to control the
mouth and the tongue and stuff, and a copy to the sensory parts of the brain. The sensory signal allows the brain to make
a prediction about what it’s about to hear. Essentially, you recite words in your head
as you say them out loud. And it turns out that same kind of signal
occurs during inner speech. That may be why you can quote “hear” yourself—you’re
literally activating the hearing part of your brain. And some psychologists think this means the
underlying purpose of internal speech is to catch errors when you talk. If the internal prediction matches what you
say, your brain knows it can filter your words out of what it’s hearing and focus on the
rest of the sounds coming in. If they don’t match—like if you stumble
over a word—your brain lets you know that you made a mistake so that you can stop and
correct yourself. But it doesn’t seem like this error correction
is absolutely essential for speech, because the two can be separated from one another. There are cases of people with brain damage
who lose their inner speech but not the ability to talk, and vice versa. Still, inner speech could have helped people
communicate better, which could explain why it evolved. This is just the prevailing hypothesis, though,
and it’s possible it’s wrong. Also, it’s likely that even if inner speech

amounts of negative inner speech. Though, studies have found that if you ask
people to think verbally about hypothetical situations—even positive ones—their mood
is lower than if you ask them to picture the hypothetical situations instead. And that does support the idea that the speech
part of inner speech might make people less happy… for some reason. Other research has tied inner speech to symptoms
common in psychotic disorders. For example, people with schizophrenia often
report hearing voices of people speaking to them or telling them what to do. One theory is that those “voices” are
actually inner speech. Remember that prediction signal I mentioned
earlier? Well, some experts think that if something
in that neural circuit is off, then the brain’s usual way of identifying self-made sounds
and thoughts could be off, too. So basically, that person’s brain might
not be so great at separating sounds they generate from ones they hear. And that may mean it also attributes inner
speech to someone else. Because of these potentially important roles
in cognition and mental health, psychologists are eager to gain a better understanding of
what inner speech is and why it happens. And figuring all that out could tell us a
lot about, well, a lot—from how our brains develop and work to what’s actually happening
in a variety of mental disorders. But as of right now, we just don’t know
that much about this thing most of us do every day. There are a lot of big questions currently
unanswered, like where inner speech comes from, why it differs between people, and what
those differences mean. Like, can you change your inner monologue? Can you train yourself to think in conversations,
or to hear other voices or your own more often? We don’t even know if you should want to
make those changes—if there are the benefits or downsides of different kinds of inner speech. And it’s probably going to be a while before
we have any clear answers, because our methods for studying it just aren’t great, and there’s
a lot of debate over basic questions, like how many people even do it in the first place. In the meantime, though, you can still talk
about it amongst yourself. Thanks to Eric for asking us about this topic,

**Transcript**:
Rejection hurts. It’s incredibly painful
to feel like you’re not wanted— and we do mean painful. fMRI studies have found that rejection
elicits brain activity in multiple neural regions
that process physical pain. And the language we use to describe
rejection mirrors this experience. Researchers recorded over a dozen
languages that relate rejection to being hurt, using terms like 
“crushed” or “broken-hearted.” So why does rejection trigger
such a strong response, and is there any way to cope 
with this unique kind of pain? Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we perceive 
that others don’t value having social connections with us. This could occur when we’re
abandoned by a romantic partner, excluded from a group,
or outright discriminated against. But it’s worth noting that these
interpersonal rejections have a social element that distinguishes
them from not getting a job. In these experiences, we perceive that the rejecting party 
undervalues our relationship. And while the pain of rejection
often increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers
can hurt our feelings. This might seem like an overreaction, but just as bodily pain warns 
us about perceived threats to our physical well-being, hurt feelings warn us about perceived
threats to our social well-being. Some behavioral psychologists
argue this warning system developed when our prehistoric ancestors lived
in small clans and depended on everyone they knew 
for survival. These humans may have evolved to perceive
rejection from anyone as a potential threat to their safety. It’s impossible to confirm this
kind of evolutionary theory, but wherever this warning
system came from, it doesn't include instructions for how to process this intense
emotional experience. So, the next time you’re feeling rejected,
try asking yourself these questions. The first thing to consider
is your relationship with the person rejecting you. Is this someone who knows you well
and whose opinion you hold dear? Or is it just a loose acquaintance? If it’s the latter, that might help
you answer the second question: does this rejection really matter? It can sting when a stranger
doesn't laugh at your joke, but it doesn’t make sense
to react strongly to a rejection with little impact on your life. Of course, brushing off even a minor 
rejection is easier said than done, since how you perceive yourself 
also factors into this equation. You likely feel more confident 
in some circumstances than others, and people tend to be especially sensitive
to rejection in situations where they have a low opinion
of themselves. So much so, that they even become 
more likely to misinterpret other people’s neutral reactions 
as rejections. This is why it can be helpful 
to both reflect on your self-view and ask yourself if the other person
is actually rejecting you. This might seem like an odd question. But you may find that while the
other person didn’t treat you as you would have liked, 
they still value your relationship. In some cases, it's also
helpful to consider whether you were expecting more acceptance
than was reasonable. Unfortunately, after asking
these questions, you might still conclude 
that a person close to you doesn’t value your relationship
as much as you do. This is a painful realization, but it
can help to remember two things. First, this rejection isn't
just about you. The other party wants something different
from your relationship, and what they want might 
be unreasonable, unfair, or simply not what you have to give. Second, their rejection isn’t proof 
that there’s something wrong with you. The pain you’re feeling 
is just part of a system nudging you to think about
your interpersonal relationships. And by reflecting on your behavior, you can find clues to help better
understand the rejection and think critically 
about the relationship you want to have with this person. Every relationship and rejection 
is unique. But whatever the specifics, it’s important to remember 
that you’re never alone in all of this. Everyone deals with rejection
throughout their life— even those who seem confident
in their belonging. And one of the most common ways to cope
with this universal experience is to reconnect with those 
who already accept you.

**Transcript**:
Rejection hurts. It’s incredibly painful
to feel like you’re not wanted— and we do mean painful. fMRI studies have found that rejection
elicits brain activity in multiple neural regions
that process physical pain. And the language we use to describe
rejection mirrors this experience. Researchers recorded over a dozen
languages that relate rejection to being hurt, using terms like 
“crushed” or “broken-hearted.” So why does rejection trigger
such a strong response, and is there any way to cope 
with this unique kind of pain? Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we perceive 
that others don’t value having social connections with us. This could occur when we’re
abandoned by a romantic partner, excluded from a group,
or outright discriminated against. But it’s worth noting that these
interpersonal rejections have a social element that distinguishes
them from not getting a job. In these experiences, we perceive that the rejecting party 
undervalues our relationship. And while the pain of rejection
often increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers
can hurt our feelings. This might seem like an overreaction, but just as bodily pain warns 
us about perceived threats to our physical well-being, hurt feelings warn us about perceived
threats to our social well-being. Some behavioral psychologists
argue this warning system developed when our prehistoric ancestors lived
in small clans and depended on everyone they knew 
for survival. These humans may have evolved to perceive
rejection from anyone as a potential threat to their safety. It’s impossible to confirm this
kind of evolutionary theory, but wherever this warning
system came from, it doesn't include instructions for how to process this intense
emotional experience. So, the next time you’re feeling rejected,
try asking yourself these questions. The first thing to consider
is your relationship with the person rejecting you. Is this someone who knows you well
and whose opinion you hold dear? Or is it just a loose acquaintance? If it’s the latter, that might help
you answer the second question: does this rejection really matter? It can sting when a stranger
doesn't laugh at your joke, but it doesn’t make sense
to react strongly to a rejection with little impact on your life. Of course, brushing off even a minor 
rejection is easier said than done, since how you perceive yourself 
also factors into this equation. You likely feel more confident 
in some circumstances than others, and people tend to be especially sensitive
to rejection in situations where they have a low opinion
of themselves. So much so, that they even become 
more likely to misinterpret other people’s neutral reactions 
as rejections. This is why it can be helpful 
to both reflect on your self-view and ask yourself if the other person
is actually rejecting you. This might seem like an odd question. But you may find that while the
other person didn’t treat you as you would have liked, 
they still value your relationship. In some cases, it's also
helpful to consider whether you were expecting more acceptance
than was reasonable. Unfortunately, after asking
these questions, you might still conclude 
that a person close to you doesn’t value your relationship
as much as you do. This is a painful realization, but it
can help to remember two things. First, this rejection isn't
just about you. The other party wants something different
from your relationship, and what they want might 
be unreasonable, unfair, or simply not what you have to give. Second, their rejection isn’t proof 
that there’s something wrong with you. The pain you’re feeling 
is just part of a system nudging you to think about
your interpersonal relationships. And by reflecting on your behavior, you can find clues to help better
understand the rejection and think critically 
about the relationship you want to have with this person. Every relationship and rejection 
is unique. But whatever the specifics, it’s important to remember 
that you’re never alone in all of this. Everyone deals with rejection
throughout their life— even those who seem confident
in their belonging. And one of the most common ways to cope
with this universal experience is to reconnect with those 
who already accept you.

**Transcript**:
During the 1600s, an expansive autonomous
settlement called Palmares reached its height in northeastern Brazil. It was founded and led by people escaping
from slavery, also called maroons. In fact, it was one of the world’s
largest maroon communities, its population reaching beyond 10,000. And its citizens were at constant war 
with colonial forces. The records we have about Palmares
mainly come from biased Dutch and Portuguese sources, but historians have managed 
to piece much of its story together. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade,
which began in the 1500s, nearly half of all enslaved African people
were sent to Portugal’s American colony: Brazil. Some escaped and sought
shelter in Brazil’s interior regions, where they formed settlements
called mocambos or quilombos. Fugitives from slavery probably arrived
in the northeast in the late 1500s. By the 1660s, their camps
had consolidated into a powerful confederation known today
as the Quilombo of Palmares. It consisted of a central capital
linking dozens of villages, which specialized in particular
agricultural goods or served as military training grounds. Citizens of Palmares, or Palmaristas,
were governed by a king and defended by an organized military. African people and Brazilian-born 
Black and Indigenous people all came seeking refuge. They collectively fished, hunted,
raised livestock, planted orchards, and grew crops 
like cassava, corn, and sugarcane. They also made use of the abundant 
palm trees for which Palmares was named, turning palm products 
into butter, wine, and light. Palmaristas crafted palm husks into pipes
and leaves into mats and baskets. They traded some of these goods
with Portuguese settlers for products like gunpowder and salt. In turn, settlers avoided Palmares’ raids during which they’d seize weapons
and take captives. The Portuguese were concerned 
with other invading imperialists, but regarded Indigenous
uprisings and Palmares as their internal threats. Palmares endangered the very
institution of slavery— the foundation of Brazil's economy. During the 1670s, the Portuguese
escalated their attacks. By this time, Ganga-Zumba
was Palmares’ leader. He ruled from the Macaco, 
which functioned as the capital. His allies and family members
governed the other villages— with women playing crucial roles 
in operation and defense. As they fought the Portuguese, Palmaristas
used the landscape to their advantage. Camouflaged and built in high places,
their mocambos offered superior lookouts. They constructed hidden ditches lined
with sharp stakes that swallowed unsuspecting soldiers 
and false roads that led to ambushes. They launched counterattacks
under the cover of night and were constantly abandoning 
and building settlements to elude the Portuguese. In 1678, after years of failed attacks, the Portuguese offered to negotiate
a peace treaty with Ganga-Zumba. The terms they agreed upon recognized
Palmares’ independence and the freedom of anyone born there. However, the treaty demanded that Palmares
pledge loyalty to the crown and return all past and future
fugitives from slavery. Many Palmaristas dissented, among them Zumbi— Ganga-Zumba’s nephew—
a rising leader himself. Before long, Ganga-Zumba was killed, likely by a group affiliated
with his nephew. As Palmares’ new leader, 
Zumbi rejected the treaty and resumed resistance 
for another 15 years. But in February of 1694, the Portuguese captured the capital 
after a devastating siege. Zumbi escaped, but they eventually
found and ambushed him. And on November 20th, 1695, 
Portuguese forces killed Zumbi. His death was not the end of Palmares,
but it was a crushing blow. After years of warfare, 
there were far fewer rebels in the area. Those who remained rallied around new
leaders and maintained a presence, however small, through the 1760s. Though, Palmares is no more thousands 
of other quilombos persist to this day. November 20th, the day of Zumbi’s death,
is celebrated across Brazil as the Day of Black Consciousness. But Zumbi was just one 
of many Palmaristas. We only know some of their names, but their fight for freedom 
echoes centuries later.

**Transcript**:
During the 1600s, an expansive autonomous
settlement called Palmares reached its height in northeastern Brazil. It was founded and led by people escaping
from slavery, also called maroons. In fact, it was one of the world’s
largest maroon communities, its population reaching beyond 10,000. And its citizens were at constant war 
with colonial forces. The records we have about Palmares
mainly come from biased Dutch and Portuguese sources, but historians have managed 
to piece much of its story together. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade,
which began in the 1500s, nearly half of all enslaved African people
were sent to Portugal’s American colony: Brazil. Some escaped and sought
shelter in Brazil’s interior regions, where they formed settlements
called mocambos or quilombos. Fugitives from slavery probably arrived
in the northeast in the late 1500s. By the 1660s, their camps
had consolidated into a powerful confederation known today
as the Quilombo of Palmares. It consisted of a central capital
linking dozens of villages, which specialized in particular
agricultural goods or served as military training grounds. Citizens of Palmares, or Palmaristas,
were governed by a king and defended by an organized military. African people and Brazilian-born 
Black and Indigenous people all came seeking refuge. They collectively fished, hunted,
raised livestock, planted orchards, and grew crops 
like cassava, corn, and sugarcane. They also made use of the abundant 
palm trees for which Palmares was named, turning palm products 
into butter, wine, and light. Palmaristas crafted palm husks into pipes
and leaves into mats and baskets. They traded some of these goods
with Portuguese settlers for products like gunpowder and salt. In turn, settlers avoided Palmares’ raids during which they’d seize weapons
and take captives. The Portuguese were concerned 
with other invading imperialists, but regarded Indigenous
uprisings and Palmares as their internal threats. Palmares endangered the very
institution of slavery— the foundation of Brazil's economy. During the 1670s, the Portuguese
escalated their attacks. By this time, Ganga-Zumba
was Palmares’ leader. He ruled from the Macaco, 
which functioned as the capital. His allies and family members
governed the other villages— with women playing crucial roles 
in operation and defense. As they fought the Portuguese, Palmaristas
used the landscape to their advantage. Camouflaged and built in high places,
their mocambos offered superior lookouts. They constructed hidden ditches lined
with sharp stakes that swallowed unsuspecting soldiers 
and false roads that led to ambushes. They launched counterattacks
under the cover of night and were constantly abandoning 
and building settlements to elude the Portuguese. In 1678, after years of failed attacks, the Portuguese offered to negotiate
a peace treaty with Ganga-Zumba. The terms they agreed upon recognized
Palmares’ independence and the freedom of anyone born there. However, the treaty demanded that Palmares
pledge loyalty to the crown and return all past and future
fugitives from slavery. Many Palmaristas dissented, among them Zumbi— Ganga-Zumba’s nephew—
a rising leader himself. Before long, Ganga-Zumba was killed, likely by a group affiliated
with his nephew. As Palmares’ new leader, 
Zumbi rejected the treaty and resumed resistance 
for another 15 years. But in February of 1694, the Portuguese captured the capital 
after a devastating siege. Zumbi escaped, but they eventually
found and ambushed him. And on November 20th, 1695, 
Portuguese forces killed Zumbi. His death was not the end of Palmares,
but it was a crushing blow. After years of warfare, 
there were far fewer rebels in the area. Those who remained rallied around new
leaders and maintained a presence, however small, through the 1760s. Though, Palmares is no more thousands 
of other quilombos persist to this day. November 20th, the day of Zumbi’s death,
is celebrated across Brazil as the Day of Black Consciousness. But Zumbi was just one 
of many Palmaristas. We only know some of their names, but their fight for freedom 
echoes centuries later.

What is the smartest age? Perhaps a day of friendly competition
will lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon
of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest,
most capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, 
but don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and 
is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, 
designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player
in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed 
in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick!
Who’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir
choose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated
with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture
the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea 
of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best
at each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible 
rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural
connections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes
through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened 
and unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways
are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, 
allowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient,
fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens 
within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills 
to flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions
involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can
learn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible 
for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may
struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, 
planning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more
flexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches
when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, 
less afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own
unique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed
prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills
that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient 
puzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, 
these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, 
known as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase
“older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge
to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider
are his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical 
regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate
logic and math puzzles. Simultaneously,
deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation
and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be 
curious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think
of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new 
experiences  and learn quickly. You’re at a dynamic stage, where the choices you make
and the skills you focus on can actually guide the development 
of your brain. So, what’s the smartest age? There’s no single answer. It’s 8, 16, 25, 65, 
and everything in between; our brains have adapted to prioritize
different skills at various ages to meet that stage of life’s challenges
and demands. So no matter who Amir picks, having 
an age-diverse team is a good strategy.

**Transcript**:
What is the smartest age? Perhaps a day of friendly competition
will lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon
of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest,
most capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, 
but don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and 
is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, 
designs satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player
in the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed 
in over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick!
Who’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir
choose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated
with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture
the scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea 
of “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best
at each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible 
rapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural
connections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes
through a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened 
and unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways
are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, 
allowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient,
fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens 
within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills 
to flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions
involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can
learn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible 
for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may
struggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, 
planning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more
flexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches
when finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, 
less afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own
unique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed
prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills
that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient 
puzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, 
these same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, 
known as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase
“older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge
to recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider
are his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical 
regions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate
logic and math puzzles. Simultaneously,
deep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation
and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be 
curious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think
of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new 
experiences  and learn quickly. You’re at a dynamic stage, where the choices you make
and the skills you focus on can actually guide the development 
of your brain. So, what’s the smartest age? There’s no single answer. It’s 8, 16, 25, 65, 
and everything in between; our brains have adapted to prioritize
different skills at various ages to meet that stage of life’s challenges
and demands. So no matter who Amir picks, having 
an age-diverse team is a good strategy.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk
once a week for 8 consecutive weeks, each time on a different 
alcoholic beverage, and each time with precisely 
the same dosage— this was science,
after all. The goal of this experiment was to find
out which alcoholic drinks cause worse hangovers. Of course, it takes much more than one 
small study to answer such a question. Since then, science has
learned a lot about hangovers— though some mysteries remain. The molecule responsible 
for hangovers is ethanol, which we colloquially refer to as alcohol. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic
beverages, and generally speaking, the more ethanol, 
the greater the potential for a hangover. The symptoms and severity can vary
depending on weight, age, genetics, and other factors. But still, hangovers generally share 
some common— and unpleasant— features. So how exactly does alcohol
cause a hangover? And is there any way 
to reliably prevent one? Alcohol slows down the communication
between neural cells. After someone has had their last drink, as the concentration of alcohol 
in the blood drops back to zero, the brain rebounds from sedation 
and swings in the other direction, entering a hyperactive state. This may lead to the tremors or 
rapid heartbeat associated with hangovers. It also makes sleep shorter 
and less restful than normal. But these effects are just the beginning— alcohol impacts so many 
of the body’s processes, throwing delicate balances off-kilter. And even the most familiar hangover
symptoms have surprising contributors. For example, alcohol disrupts
levels of many hormones. One of those hormones is cortisol. Normally, fluctuating cortisol levels
help regulate wakefulness throughout the day and night. So the disruption in cortisol 
during a hangover may cause people to feel groggy 
or disoriented. Another hormone alcohol interferes
with is vasopressin, which normally decreases the volume 
of urine made by the kidneys. By decreasing levels of vasopressin, alcohol causes people to pee more
and become dehydrated. Dehydration can lead to thirst, dry mouth,
weakness, lightheadedness, and headache, one of the most common hangover symptoms. In addition to dehydration, 
hangover headaches can result from alcohol’s influence 
on chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters
involved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing
the ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,
weakness, and mood disturbances experienced during a hangover. Meanwhile, alcohol stimulates
the immune system, leading to inflammation that can
damage cells within the brain, affect mood, and impair memory. And it can irritate 
the gastrointestinal tract and inflame the lining 
of the stomach and intestines. Alcohol may also slow down
stomach emptying, which could lead to increased
production of gastric acid. This is why alcohol can cause 
stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Alcoholic drinks also contain other
substances that are produced during the fermentation process 
that give the drink its specific flavor. Some evidence suggests that one of these,
methanol, is particularly bad for hangovers. The body doesn’t start
metabolizing methanol until it’s done processing ethanol. And when it does, 
the toxic metabolites of methanol may potentially worsen 
the hangover symptoms. Beverages that are closer to pure ethanol,
such as gin and vodka, may cause fewer hangover effects. Meanwhile, the presence of flavoring
ingredients in beverages like whiskey, brandy, and red wine, may make these kinds of alcohol 
cause more hangover symptoms. So, the choice of alcoholic
beverage matters, but any of them can cause hangovers,
simply because they all contain alcohol. So, do common hangover remedies
actually work? Drinking water and electrolyte beverages
can help reduce symptoms related to dehydration. And eating— especially carbs—
can help replenish the glucose levels alcohol reduces. But ultimately, the only sure way 
to prevent a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation
or not at all.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the biggest factor leading to the incidence and severity of hangovers?
Options: A. The type of alcohol consumed, B. The amount of alcohol consumed, C. The time of day that alcohol is consumed, D. The mixers added to an alcoholic beverage

on chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters
involved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing
the ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,
weakness, and mood disturbances experienced during a hangover. Meanwhile, alcohol stimulates
the immune system, leading to inflammation that can
damage cells within the brain, affect mood, and impair memory. And it can irritate 
the gastrointestinal tract and inflame the lining 
of the stomach and intestines. Alcohol may also slow down
stomach emptying, which could lead to increased
production of gastric acid. This is why alcohol can cause 
stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Alcoholic drinks also contain other
substances that are produced during the fermentation process 
that give the drink its specific flavor. Some evidence suggests that one of these,
methanol, is particularly bad for hangovers. The body doesn’t start
metabolizing methanol until it’s done processing ethanol. And when it does, 
the toxic metabolites of methanol may potentially worsen 
the hangover symptoms. Beverages that are closer to pure ethanol,
such as gin and vodka, may cause fewer hangover effects. Meanwhile, the presence of flavoring
ingredients in beverages like whiskey, brandy, and red wine, may make these kinds of alcohol 
cause more hangover symptoms. So, the choice of alcoholic
beverage matters, but any of them can cause hangovers,
simply because they all contain alcohol. So, do common hangover remedies
actually work? Drinking water and electrolyte beverages
can help reduce symptoms related to dehydration. And eating— especially carbs—
can help replenish the glucose levels alcohol reduces. But ultimately, the only sure way 
to prevent a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation
or not at all.

**Transcript**:
In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk
once a week for 8 consecutive weeks, each time on a different 
alcoholic beverage, and each time with precisely 
the same dosage— this was science,
after all. The goal of this experiment was to find
out which alcoholic drinks cause worse hangovers. Of course, it takes much more than one 
small study to answer such a question. Since then, science has
learned a lot about hangovers— though some mysteries remain. The molecule responsible 
for hangovers is ethanol, which we colloquially refer to as alcohol. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic
beverages, and generally speaking, the more ethanol, 
the greater the potential for a hangover. The symptoms and severity can vary
depending on weight, age, genetics, and other factors. But still, hangovers generally share 
some common— and unpleasant— features. So how exactly does alcohol
cause a hangover? And is there any way 
to reliably prevent one? Alcohol slows down the communication
between neural cells. After someone has had their last drink, as the concentration of alcohol 
in the blood drops back to zero, the brain rebounds from sedation 
and swings in the other direction, entering a hyperactive state. This may lead to the tremors or 
rapid heartbeat associated with hangovers. It also makes sleep shorter 
and less restful than normal. But these effects are just the beginning— alcohol impacts so many 
of the body’s processes, throwing delicate balances off-kilter. And even the most familiar hangover
symptoms have surprising contributors. For example, alcohol disrupts
levels of many hormones. One of those hormones is cortisol. Normally, fluctuating cortisol levels
help regulate wakefulness throughout the day and night. So the disruption in cortisol 
during a hangover may cause people to feel groggy 
or disoriented. Another hormone alcohol interferes
with is vasopressin, which normally decreases the volume 
of urine made by the kidneys. By decreasing levels of vasopressin, alcohol causes people to pee more
and become dehydrated. Dehydration can lead to thirst, dry mouth,
weakness, lightheadedness, and headache, one of the most common hangover symptoms. In addition to dehydration, 
hangover headaches can result from alcohol’s influence 
on chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters
involved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing
the ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,

**Transcript**:
Transcriber:  When I’m out at the grocery store
or maybe a restaurant or the park with my son --
he’s six and a half -- people will stop us and mention
that they think that he’s handsome. I agree. They'll use that opportunity
to chop it up with him, and often when they're done
talking with him, they’ll mention that they think
he’s a smart and engaging little guy. When those people walk away,
the thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember
meeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man. This thought comes to my mind because I’ve written two books about race
and racism in the United States, and this kind of work
can produce feelings of pessimism. One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have
an orientation toward progress. In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate
the distance between where we were and where we are now. But that same orientation can blind us
from the gap between where we are and where we could or should be. The other thing I’ve learned
about Americans is that we have a very,
very narrow understanding of racism, mostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people -- old people from the South. And this really narrow definition
can constrain our opportunities to produce a more
racially egalitarian society. We like to hunt for races and distance ourselves from people who say
mean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s. But the fact of the matter is that
we might just need to look in the mirror. Now, I'm not saying
that everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying
is that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequality. Some people say, “Well, you do all this
work about racism. What’s the answer?” And I say that the first thing
we might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what racism is in the first place. History shows that racists
have had the upper hand in deciding who the racists are
and what racism is, and it’s never them
or the things that they do. But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise
definition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren’t in constant
fear of their children’s lives. I'd like to dispel
three myths about racism on our trek toward mutual understanding. First: it’s true that the South has done
its work to earn its reputation as the most racist region. But there are other states and regions
that are competing for the title. For example, if we look at the most segregated states
in terms of where Black kids go to school, we'll see, sure, some are in the South. There are some out west, in the Midwest and in the Northeast. They're where we live. Or if we look at states
with the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them
are in the South. They're where we live. My colleague Rebecca Kreitzer and I looked at a standard battery
of racial attitudes of prejudice, and we found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated
the most racially negative attitudes. But this geography has evolved,
and things have changed. By 2016, we found
that the Dakotas, Nebraska, states in the Midwest, in the Northeast, were competing for the "most prejudiced
population" titles. Now, I'm not saying that one state
is more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own
special brand of racism. And it doesn't have to be like this. Most of the inequalities that we see in
our day-to-day lives happen at the state and local level. What that means is that we don't
have to go all the way to Congress to make change in our communities. We can simply hold our city, our county,
our state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomes. Myth two: we're not that good
at hunting for racists. Remember that time when the governor
of Virginia did blackface, and people were like, "Oh, that's bad.
I need to get that racist out of here"? I was giving y'all the side-eye,
and here's why. While people were going back to yearbooks to look for things
that were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into
the current-day policy stances of legislators who probably did
blackface but didn't get caught. So, how many of us
might have supported a candidate who is willing to let neighborhoods
secede from their district so that kids could go
to all-white schools -- in the 21st century? Or how many of us might have
supported a ballot measure that systematically reduced
some groups' chances of voting? Or how many of us might have focused on
the behavior of Black mothers rather than doctors or health care
systems and policies when we learn about
the huge racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality? It doesn't have to be like this. We could do something different. We could scrutinize the behaviors
of the rule makers. We could orient ourselves
toward a more just society, and on our way there, we can't mystify practical
policy solutions. Myth three: If you believe that when all
the grandmas in Mississippi die that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work
of eradicating racism, but there are some things
that we should note. We know that young folks, young white
folks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it,
they're looking for it. But we also know that they don't
live diverse lives. Research shows that the average white
American literally has one black friend. And what that means is that most
don't have any at all. Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that
even when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have
positive interactions, no less any with their neighbors
who aren't white. My research with Professor
Christopher DeSante shows that when we ask white millennials
their racial attitudes and policy preferences, that they're sometimes,
just as in other times, even more racially
conservative than boomers. When we ask them about the things
that are important to them, they don't have
any particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequality. How did we get like this? Well, one of the things we might
think about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems
that we want them to solve. Research shows that
white parents in particular will either choose to not talk
about issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them
from a harsh racial reality or they instill colorblind lessons, and that can actually reinforce
negative racial attitudes. So it's kind of like how some of your parents
might have given you books about puberty so they didn't have to talk about
the birds and the bees, and then you tried to connect all the dots
and then you did it all wrong. It's like that. It doesn't have to be like this. We can do better. We can have hard
conversations with our kids so that they don't grow up
like many of us did, thinking that talking about racism
makes you a racist -- it doesn't -- and so that we can prevent them
from making the same mistakes that we've seen in the past. Remember a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live
in a post-racial world? Well, I say that it's time for us
to think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like
to live in a post-racist world. But in order to do that,
we'd have to come together to have a shared definition of racism -- not just in the matter
of hearts and minds, but in systems, policies, rules, decisions made over and over again
to marginalize some people -- and agree to become anti-racists --
people who learn more and do better. So we could ask harder
questions of candidates about their stances on racial inequality before we throw
our full weight behind them. We could buycott or boycott businesses whose practices don't align
with our values. We could talk to our kids about racism. We could figure out our state's
special brand of racism and work to eradicate it. People made racial disparities,
and people can unmake them. And sure, it'll be hard, but the fact of the matter is, someone is depending on us
to do nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Hi. My name is Aparna. I am a shopaholic -- (Laughter) and I'm addicted to online returns. (Laughter) Well, at least I was. At one time, I had two or three
packages of clothing delivered to me every other day. I would intentionally buy the same item in a couple different sizes
and many colors, because I did not know
what I really wanted. So I overordered, I tried things on,
and then I sent what didn't work back. Once my daughter was watching me
return some of those packages back, and she said, "Mom,
I think you have a problem." (Laughter) I didn't think so. I mean, it's free shipping
and free returns, right? (Laughter) I didn't even think twice about it, until I heard a statistic
at work that shocked me. You see, I'm a global solutions
director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting
with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs. One of their biggest concerns
was managing returns. Just this past holiday season alone, they had 7.5 million pieces
of clothing returned to them. I could not stop thinking about it. What happens to all
these returned clothes? So I came home and researched. And I learned that every year, four billion pounds of returned clothing
ends up in the landfill. That's like every resident in the US
did a load of laundry last night and decided to throw it
in the trash today. I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this." (Laughter) My job is to find solutions
to logistical issues like these -- not create them. So this issue became very personal to me. I said, "You know what?
We have to solve this." And we can, with some of the existing
systems we already have in place. And then I started to wonder:
How did we get here? I mean, it was only like six years ago
when a study recommended that offering free online returns
would drive customers to spend more. We started seeing companies
offering free online returns to drive more sales
and provide a better experience. What we didn't realize is that this would lead to more items
being returned as well. In the US, companies lost
$351 billion in sales in 2017 alone. Retailers are scrambling
to recover their losses. They try to place that returned item
online to be sold again, or they'll sell it to a discount partner or a liquidator. Basically, if companies cannot find
a place for this item quickly and economically, its place becomes the trash. Suddenly, I felt very guilty
for being that shopper, somebody who contributes to this. Who would have thought
my innocent shopping behavior would be hurting not only me, but our planet as well? And as I thought about what to do, I kept thinking: Why does the item have to be returned
to the retailer in the first place? What if there was another way, a win-win for everyone? What if when a person
is trying to return something, it could go to the next
shopper who wants it, and not the retailer? What if, instead of a return, they could do what I call a "green turn"? Consumers could use an app
to take pictures of the item and verify the condition
while returning it. Artificial intelligence systems could then
sort these clothes by condition -- mint condition or slightly used -- and direct it to the next
appropriate person. Mint-condition clothes could
automatically go to the next buyer, while slightly used clothes
could be marked down and offered online again. The retailer can decide the business rules on the number of times
a particular item can be resold. All that the consumer would need to do
is obtain a mobile code, take it to the nearest shipping place
to be packed and shipped, and off it goes from
one buyer to the next, not the landfill. Now you will ask, "Would people really
go through all this trouble?" I think they would if they had incentives, like loyalty points or cash back. Let's call it "green cash." There would be a whole
new opportunity to make money from this new customer base
looking to buy these returns. This system would make
a fun thing like shopping a spiritual experience that helps save our planet. (Applause) This is doable and would probably take six months
to weave some of our existing systems and run a pilot. Even before any of these
logistical systems are in place, each of us shoppers can act now, if every single adult in the US
made a few small changes to our shopping behavior. Take the extra time
to research and think -- Do I really need this item? No: Do I really want this item? -- before making a purchase. And if every one of us adults in the US returned five less items this year, we would keep 240 million pounds
of clothes out of the landfill. Six percent reduction, just like that. This environmental problem
that we have created is not thousands of years away; it's happening today, and must stop now to prevent growing
landfills across the globe. I want to leave my daughter
and my daughter's daughter a better and cleaner place
than I found it, so I have not only stopped overordering, I recycle religiously as well. And you can, too. It's not difficult. Before we fill our shopping carts
and our landfills with extra items that we don't want, let's pause next time

**Transcript**:
Hi. My name is Aparna. I am a shopaholic -- (Laughter) and I'm addicted to online returns. (Laughter) Well, at least I was. At one time, I had two or three
packages of clothing delivered to me every other day. I would intentionally buy the same item in a couple different sizes
and many colors, because I did not know
what I really wanted. So I overordered, I tried things on,
and then I sent what didn't work back. Once my daughter was watching me
return some of those packages back, and she said, "Mom,
I think you have a problem." (Laughter) I didn't think so. I mean, it's free shipping
and free returns, right? (Laughter) I didn't even think twice about it, until I heard a statistic
at work that shocked me. You see, I'm a global solutions
director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting
with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs. One of their biggest concerns
was managing returns. Just this past holiday season alone, they had 7.5 million pieces
of clothing returned to them. I could not stop thinking about it. What happens to all
these returned clothes? So I came home and researched. And I learned that every year, four billion pounds of returned clothing
ends up in the landfill. That's like every resident in the US
did a load of laundry last night and decided to throw it
in the trash today. I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this." (Laughter) My job is to find solutions
to logistical issues like these -- not create them. So this issue became very personal to me. I said, "You know what?
We have to solve this." And we can, with some of the existing
systems we already have in place. And then I started to wonder:
How did we get here? I mean, it was only like six years ago
when a study recommended that offering free online returns
would drive customers to spend more. We started seeing companies
offering free online returns to drive more sales
and provide a better experience. What we didn't realize is that this would lead to more items
being returned as well. In the US, companies lost
$351 billion in sales in 2017 alone. Retailers are scrambling
to recover their losses. They try to place that returned item
online to be sold again, or they'll sell it to a discount partner or a liquidator. Basically, if companies cannot find

**Transcript**:
Animated corpses appear
in stories all over the world throughout recorded history. But zombies have a distinct lineage— one that traces back 
to Equatorial and Central Africa. The first clue is in the word 
“zombie” itself. Its exact etymological origins 
are unknown, but there are several candidates. The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,
use the word “ndzumbi” for corpse. The Kikongo word “nzambi” refers
variously to the supreme being, an ancestor with superhuman abilities,
or another deity. And, in certain languages spoken
in Angola and the Congo, “zumbi” refers to an object inhabited 
by a spirit, or someone returned from the dead. There are also similarities
in certain cultural beliefs. For example, in Kongo tradition, 
it’s thought that once someone dies, their spirit can be housed 
in a physical object which might bring protection 
and good luck. Similar beliefs about what
might happen to someone’s soul after death are held 
in various parts of Africa. Between 1517 and 1804, France and Spain enslaved 
hundreds of thousands of African people, taking them to the Caribbean island that now contains Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. There, the religious beliefs 
of enslaved African people mixed with the Catholic traditions 
of colonial authorities and a religion known as “vodou” developed. According to some vodou beliefs, a 
person’s soul can be captured and stored, becoming a body-less “zombi.” Alternatively, if a body isn’t properly
attended to soon after death, a sorcerer called a “bokor”
can capture a corpse and turn it into a soulless zombi
that will perform their bidding. Historically, these zombis were said 
to be put to work as laborers who needed neither food nor rest 
and would enrich their captor’s fortune. In other words, zombification seemed 
to represent the horrors of enslavement that many Haitian people experienced. It was the worst possible fate: a form of enslavement that not even
death could free you from. The zombi was deprived of an afterlife
and trapped in eternal subjugation. Because of this, in Haitian culture, zombis are commonly seen as victims
deserving of sympathy and care. The zombie underwent a transformation
after the US occupation of Haiti began in 1915— this time, through the lens
of Western pop culture. During the occupation, US citizens
propagated many racist beliefs about Black Haitian people. Among false accounts
of devil worship and human sacrifice, zombie stories captured
the American imagination. And in 1932, zombies debuted
on the big screen in a film called “White Zombie.” Set in Haiti, the film’s protagonist 
must rescue his fiancée from an evil vodou master who runs 
a sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of
sympathy isn't the enslaved workforce, but the victimized white woman. Over the following decades, zombies
appeared in many American films, usually with loose references
to Haitian culture, though some veered off to involve
aliens and Nazis. Then came the wildly influential 1968 film
“Night of the Living Dead,” in which a group of strangers tries 
to survive an onslaught of slow-moving, flesh-eating monsters. The film’s director remarked that he never
envisioned his living dead as zombies. Instead, it was the audience who
recognized them as such. But from then on, zombies became linked
to an insatiable craving for flesh— with a particular taste for brains added
in 1985′s “The Return of the Living Dead.” In these and many subsequent films,
no sorcerer controls the zombies; they’re the monsters. And in many iterations, 
later fueled by 2002′s “28 Days Later,” zombification became 
a contagious phenomenon. For decades now, artists around the world
have used zombies to shine a light on the social ills 
and anxieties of their moment— from consumer culture to the global lack
of disaster preparedness. But, in effect, American pop culture also
initially erased the zombies origins— cannibalizing its original significance and transforming the victim 
into the monster.

a sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of
sympathy isn't the enslaved workforce, but the victimized white woman. Over the following decades, zombies
appeared in many American films, usually with loose references
to Haitian culture, though some veered off to involve
aliens and Nazis. Then came the wildly influential 1968 film
“Night of the Living Dead,” in which a group of strangers tries 
to survive an onslaught of slow-moving, flesh-eating monsters. The film’s director remarked that he never
envisioned his living dead as zombies. Instead, it was the audience who
recognized them as such. But from then on, zombies became linked
to an insatiable craving for flesh— with a particular taste for brains added
in 1985′s “The Return of the Living Dead.” In these and many subsequent films,
no sorcerer controls the zombies; they’re the monsters. And in many iterations, 
later fueled by 2002′s “28 Days Later,” zombification became 
a contagious phenomenon. For decades now, artists around the world
have used zombies to shine a light on the social ills 
and anxieties of their moment— from consumer culture to the global lack
of disaster preparedness. But, in effect, American pop culture also
initially erased the zombies origins— cannibalizing its original significance and transforming the victim 
into the monster.

**Transcript**:
Animated corpses appear
in stories all over the world throughout recorded history. But zombies have a distinct lineage— one that traces back 
to Equatorial and Central Africa. The first clue is in the word 
“zombie” itself. Its exact etymological origins 
are unknown, but there are several candidates. The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,
use the word “ndzumbi” for corpse. The Kikongo word “nzambi” refers
variously to the supreme being, an ancestor with superhuman abilities,
or another deity. And, in certain languages spoken
in Angola and the Congo, “zumbi” refers to an object inhabited 
by a spirit, or someone returned from the dead. There are also similarities
in certain cultural beliefs. For example, in Kongo tradition, 
it’s thought that once someone dies, their spirit can be housed 
in a physical object which might bring protection 
and good luck. Similar beliefs about what
might happen to someone’s soul after death are held 
in various parts of Africa. Between 1517 and 1804, France and Spain enslaved 
hundreds of thousands of African people, taking them to the Caribbean island that now contains Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. There, the religious beliefs 
of enslaved African people mixed with the Catholic traditions 
of colonial authorities and a religion known as “vodou” developed. According to some vodou beliefs, a 
person’s soul can be captured and stored, becoming a body-less “zombi.” Alternatively, if a body isn’t properly
attended to soon after death, a sorcerer called a “bokor”
can capture a corpse and turn it into a soulless zombi
that will perform their bidding. Historically, these zombis were said 
to be put to work as laborers who needed neither food nor rest 
and would enrich their captor’s fortune. In other words, zombification seemed 
to represent the horrors of enslavement that many Haitian people experienced. It was the worst possible fate: a form of enslavement that not even
death could free you from. The zombi was deprived of an afterlife
and trapped in eternal subjugation. Because of this, in Haitian culture, zombis are commonly seen as victims
deserving of sympathy and care. The zombie underwent a transformation
after the US occupation of Haiti began in 1915— this time, through the lens
of Western pop culture. During the occupation, US citizens
propagated many racist beliefs about Black Haitian people. Among false accounts
of devil worship and human sacrifice, zombie stories captured
the American imagination. And in 1932, zombies debuted
on the big screen in a film called “White Zombie.” Set in Haiti, the film’s protagonist 
must rescue his fiancée from an evil vodou master who runs 
a sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of

**Transcript**:
It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,
arrested her, and led her to the room
where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power
and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, 
claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most
turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries
first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power,
building businesses and claiming arable land 
that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility 
closely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries 
to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii 
as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business 
opportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar
to the US tariff-free— some of their descendants
shifted positions. They formed a political group 
known as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,
bringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born
into an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, 
ascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,
the emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting
where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king 
to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians 
of their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group
of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very 
persons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats 
and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined
to restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom 
had lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, 
she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, 
the so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted 
of many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense 
that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines
marched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” 
removed Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, 
“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”
declared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed 
that Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing
a new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, 
some of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds
and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani 
sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,
and they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs 
expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt
that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news
that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets
from the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed 
under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled
to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists
and over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress
to halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, 
the Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii 
as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared 
it a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating
Queen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning
for the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, 
and national liberation. When she died in 1917, 
these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced 
Queen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have 
peace and annexation the first thing to do 
is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left
a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people
never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight
in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,
Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give
the last drop of my blood.”

**Transcript**:
It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,
arrested her, and led her to the room
where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power
and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, 
claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most
turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries
first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power,
building businesses and claiming arable land 
that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility 
closely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries 
to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii 
as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business 
opportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar
to the US tariff-free— some of their descendants
shifted positions. They formed a political group 
known as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,
bringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born
into an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, 
ascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,
the emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting
where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king 
to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians 
of their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group
of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very 
persons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats 
and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined
to restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom 
had lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, 
she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, 
the so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted 
of many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense 
that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines
marched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” 
removed Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, 
“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”
declared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed 
that Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing
a new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, 
some of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds
and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani 
sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,
and they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs 
expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt
that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news
that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets
from the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed 
under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled
to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists
and over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress
to halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, 
the Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii 
as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared 
it a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating
Queen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning
for the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, 
and national liberation. When she died in 1917, 
these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced 
Queen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have 
peace and annexation the first thing to do 
is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left
a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people
never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight
in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,
Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give
the last drop of my blood.”

is obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left
a resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people
never wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight
in her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,
Queen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give
the last drop of my blood.”

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What, you want my milkshake? Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares 
to make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr. 
delivers a speech. He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’
and a ‘monstrous scourge.’ He insists that ‘the extension 
of the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed 
in Missouri, or any new state.” Obviously. “Representative Tyler disagrees. He believes it is a state’s right 
to choose whether or not to allow slavery. He doesn’t think the federal government
can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.” Whaaaaat? “Senator Thomas proposes
what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along
with another state, Maine. Slavery will be allowed in Missouri
and prohibited in Maine. He also suggests drawing a line 
through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north 
of the line, and allowed south of it.” And this is where I have
to draw the line. That’s better. Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing
is fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly. The compromise is based 
on the middle ground fallacy. By saying that half of the new territories
should allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints,
pro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong,
while the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here:
the pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all, 
is to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those 
among you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor
of ending slavery. In response to your many contorted
arguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery 
is morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it
and many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved
other people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions
on this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention 
to this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences
in many situations. Failure to recognize the fact 
that a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible,
is also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless
injustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people—
which rest assured, I don’t mistake you for—
fall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise
as a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln 
was elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more
states threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery
in states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion 
into new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War
has broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved
with a compromise.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2007, researchers surveyed
over 180 teachers to understand if they held stereotypes
about students from three racial groups. The results surfaced several
negative stereotypes, labeling Black students
as aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish
and materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’
other biases, the most commonly held opinion
was that Asian students were significantly more industrious,
intelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem
like a good thing, or at least better than other,
negative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable
stereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount
of harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,
and even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians
is actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged
in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used
to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment
in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated
into American society. Former incarcerees were praised
as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,
“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story
of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”
incarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language
classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave
in white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid
returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies
and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded
that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage
to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected
traitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was
coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an
obedient and respectful “model minority." They also criticized so-called 
“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened
by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit
Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story
of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities
as inferior. This narrative put a wedge
between Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history
of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities
against each other. In doing so, the model minority myth
also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top
and everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe
the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,
might not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths
and weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups
meet certain standards— typically, standards set
by a white majority. In this case,
the model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups
who are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving
of tolerance, while groups that challenge
the status quo are not. This stereotype also negatively impacts
the Asian individuals it describes. According to a psychological phenomenon
known as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure
on their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative
group stereotypes. But this phenomenon can occur around
seemingly positive stereotypes as well. The pressure associated with living
up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice
when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs
catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less
support than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created
by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize
racially motivated violence and discrimination against
Asian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly
groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds
and unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label
might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works
like every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people
to a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability
to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals
within that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels
is essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating
harmful stereotypes for good.

**Transcript**:
In 2007, researchers surveyed
over 180 teachers to understand if they held stereotypes
about students from three racial groups. The results surfaced several
negative stereotypes, labeling Black students
as aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish
and materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’
other biases, the most commonly held opinion
was that Asian students were significantly more industrious,
intelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem
like a good thing, or at least better than other,
negative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable
stereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount
of harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,
and even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians
is actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged
in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used
to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment
in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated
into American society. Former incarcerees were praised
as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,
“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story
of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”
incarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language
classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave
in white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid
returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies
and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded
that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage
to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected
traitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was
coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an
obedient and respectful “model minority." They also criticized so-called 
“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened
by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit
Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story
of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities
as inferior. This narrative put a wedge
between Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history
of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities
against each other. In doing so, the model minority myth
also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top
and everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe
the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,
might not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths

up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice
when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs
catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less
support than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created
by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize
racially motivated violence and discrimination against
Asian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly
groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds
and unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label
might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works
like every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people
to a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability
to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals
within that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels
is essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating
harmful stereotypes for good.

**Transcript**:
In 2007, researchers surveyed
over 180 teachers to understand if they held stereotypes
about students from three racial groups. The results surfaced several
negative stereotypes, labeling Black students
as aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish
and materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’
other biases, the most commonly held opinion
was that Asian students were significantly more industrious,
intelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem
like a good thing, or at least better than other,
negative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable
stereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount
of harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,
and even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians
is actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged
in the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used
to claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment
in US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated
into American society. Former incarcerees were praised
as compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,
“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story
of thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”
incarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language
classes, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave
in white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid
returning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies
and propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded
that Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage
to transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected
traitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was
coined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an
obedient and respectful “model minority." They also criticized so-called 
“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened
by the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit
Black Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story
of Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities
as inferior. This narrative put a wedge
between Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history
of fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities
against each other. In doing so, the model minority myth
also enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top
and everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe
the model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,
might not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths
and weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups
meet certain standards— typically, standards set
by a white majority. In this case,
the model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups
who are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving
of tolerance, while groups that challenge
the status quo are not. This stereotype also negatively impacts
the Asian individuals it describes. According to a psychological phenomenon
known as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure
on their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative
group stereotypes. But this phenomenon can occur around
seemingly positive stereotypes as well. The pressure associated with living
up to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice
when Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs
catering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less
support than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created
by this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize
racially motivated violence and discrimination against
Asian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly
groups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds
and unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label
might appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works
like every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people
to a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability
to understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals
within that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels
is essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating
harmful stereotypes for good.
