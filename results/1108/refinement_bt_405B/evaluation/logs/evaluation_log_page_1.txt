**Transcript**:
More than 2,500 years ago, one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated 
popstars and erotic poets enraptured listeners. In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard
his nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked 
the boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said. So, who was this revered figure? Her name was Sappho. She lived on the Greek island 
of Lesbos around 600 BCE. Like other singer-songwriters of the time, she sang while playing the lyre, a stringed instrument from which
the term “lyrics” is derived. But Sappho lyrics offered a uniquely
intimate perspective on love, passion, and longing. She’s the first on record to combine the 
words “bitter” and “sweet,” for instance, to describe at once the thrills 
and devastations of romance. Sappho was an aristocrat thought
to have married a man, though none of her surviving
work mentions him. It does reference other family
as well as festivals, colorful clothing, and growing old. But Sappho is best known for her lyrics
about homoerotic desire for women. In one song, as her female companion
departs tearfully, Sappho says, “let me remind you /
... the lovely times we shared.” She describes flower garlands, perfumes,
“and,” she says, “on soft beds / 
... you quenched your desire.” In another, she describes 
a friend in a distant city, “Pacing far away, her gentle heart
devoured by powerful desire, she remembers slender Atthis.” The word “Lesbian” means 
someone from Lesbos, but, because of Sappho, 
it now also describes a woman who’s gay. In ancient Greece, the norm was 
for everyone to marry and have children. While men were usually permitted to have
homosexual relationships based on their status, 
women weren’t. But it appears that, 
on Lesbos at this time, aristocratic women generally
had more freedom. Yet the details of Sappho’s
life remain mysterious, partially because only fragments 
of her poetry survive. In ancient times, however, 
so much of it persisted that it seemed it would last forever. Admirers performed Sappho cover songs
and committed her poetry to papyrus, parchment, and pottery. Three centuries after Sappho’s death, a Greek author declared that her words
would endure “as long as ships sail from the Nile.” Another century later, the Library of  Alexandria housed 
nine scrolls of her work, numbering over 10,000 lines. But natural forces eroded the collection. And monks, tasked with preserving 
ancient writing, likely neglected or destroyed her work. One 2nd century Christian leader 
called Sappho “a whore who sang about her
own licentiousness.” Later, a Pope and Archbishop
ordered her poetry burned. Almost all of it had vanished
by the Middle Ages. Then, about a century ago, people began rediscovering 
Sappho’s poetry— in locations like an ancient Egyptian 
garbage dump. Now, we have around 700 lines, representing less than 10%
of Sappho’s total known work. We only have one complete poem of hers. About a dozen others are substantial,
but most are mere fragments. New pieces of Sappho’s songs 
probably will be found. Some may already be sitting 
in museum archives, to be revealed when technology 
allows scholars to read through scrolls 
too fragile to unroll. What we are currently left 
with is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors. Ovid insisted that Sappho fell 
in love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected,
leapt from a cliff to her death. Another tale asserts that she ran 
a girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems
were merely students for whom she felt platonic affection. Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho 
or deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts
of misogyny and homophobia. Despite the distortions 
of the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time
and resonate today. More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time 
will remember us” And, thankfully, we do.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some relation to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Sappho's place of residence, and the correct answer is Lesbos. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Sappho's residence, Question 1 mentions Sappho as the ancient Greek poet celebrated for her intimate and personal poetry about love, passion, and longing, but it does not provide information about her place of residence.

However, I can suggest that Question 5 has some relation to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions the social norms in ancient Greece, which is the context where Sappho lived. But it does not directly ask about her place of residence.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a direct match. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 1, but with a note that it does not directly ask about Sappho's residence.

with is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors. Ovid insisted that Sappho fell 
in love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected,
leapt from a cliff to her death. Another tale asserts that she ran 
a girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems
were merely students for whom she felt platonic affection. Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho 
or deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts
of misogyny and homophobia. Despite the distortions 
of the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time
and resonate today. More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time 
will remember us” And, thankfully, we do.

**Transcript**:
More than 2,500 years ago, one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated 
popstars and erotic poets enraptured listeners. In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard
his nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked 
the boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said. So, who was this revered figure? Her name was Sappho. She lived on the Greek island 
of Lesbos around 600 BCE. Like other singer-songwriters of the time, she sang while playing the lyre, a stringed instrument from which
the term “lyrics” is derived. But Sappho lyrics offered a uniquely
intimate perspective on love, passion, and longing. She’s the first on record to combine the 
words “bitter” and “sweet,” for instance, to describe at once the thrills 
and devastations of romance. Sappho was an aristocrat thought
to have married a man, though none of her surviving
work mentions him. It does reference other family
as well as festivals, colorful clothing, and growing old. But Sappho is best known for her lyrics
about homoerotic desire for women. In one song, as her female companion
departs tearfully, Sappho says, “let me remind you /
... the lovely times we shared.” She describes flower garlands, perfumes,
“and,” she says, “on soft beds / 
... you quenched your desire.” In another, she describes 
a friend in a distant city, “Pacing far away, her gentle heart
devoured by powerful desire, she remembers slender Atthis.” The word “Lesbian” means 
someone from Lesbos, but, because of Sappho, 
it now also describes a woman who’s gay. In ancient Greece, the norm was 
for everyone to marry and have children. While men were usually permitted to have
homosexual relationships based on their status, 
women weren’t. But it appears that, 
on Lesbos at this time, aristocratic women generally
had more freedom. Yet the details of Sappho’s
life remain mysterious, partially because only fragments 
of her poetry survive. In ancient times, however, 
so much of it persisted that it seemed it would last forever. Admirers performed Sappho cover songs
and committed her poetry to papyrus, parchment, and pottery. Three centuries after Sappho’s death, a Greek author declared that her words
would endure “as long as ships sail from the Nile.” Another century later, the Library of  Alexandria housed 
nine scrolls of her work, numbering over 10,000 lines. But natural forces eroded the collection. And monks, tasked with preserving 
ancient writing, likely neglected or destroyed her work. One 2nd century Christian leader 
called Sappho “a whore who sang about her
own licentiousness.” Later, a Pope and Archbishop
ordered her poetry burned. Almost all of it had vanished
by the Middle Ages. Then, about a century ago, people began rediscovering 
Sappho’s poetry— in locations like an ancient Egyptian 
garbage dump. Now, we have around 700 lines, representing less than 10%
of Sappho’s total known work. We only have one complete poem of hers. About a dozen others are substantial,
but most are mere fragments. New pieces of Sappho’s songs 
probably will be found. Some may already be sitting 
in museum archives, to be revealed when technology 
allows scholars to read through scrolls 
too fragile to unroll. What we are currently left 
with is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors. Ovid insisted that Sappho fell 
in love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected,
leapt from a cliff to her death. Another tale asserts that she ran 
a girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems
were merely students for whom she felt platonic affection. Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho 
or deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts
of misogyny and homophobia. Despite the distortions 
of the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time
and resonate today. More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time 
will remember us” And, thankfully, we do.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of content. However, it does not match the question intent.

A more relevant match is not found in the provided generated MCQs as none of them specifically ask about the materials on which Sappho's poetry fragments were written.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content related to Sappho's poetry, I would say Question 7 is the closest match, as it talks about the current state of Sappho's surviving work. Nevertheless, it does not specifically ask about the materials on which the poetry fragments were written.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
In 1960, American composer John Cage 
went on national television to share his latest work. But rather than employing
traditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded 
by household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes,
a toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios. Armed with these tools and a stopwatch,
he performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds
with a serious expression and incredible precision. Some viewers found
the performance hysterical, while others thought it was
completely absurd. But most people watching likely shared 
the same question: is this even music? This question is harder to answer
than you might think. What we determine as music often
depends on our expectations. For example, imagine you’re 
in a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns. Most people would agree
that this is music. But if you were on the highway hearing
the same thing, many would call it noise. After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t 
musicians... right? Expectations like these influence how
we categorize everything we hear. We typically think something sounds 
more musical if it uses a recognizable structure 
or popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns. And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific
instruments and harmonies. These expectations are based 
on existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone. They vary across different cultures
and time periods. And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing 
the boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover 
what new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints. He began pioneering new instruments
that blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent
existing instruments. He also explored new ways for music
to mingle with other art forms. He and his creative and romantic partner,
Merce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music
and Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently
before being performed together. But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question
the boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence. Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s
most famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing
but musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds. This wasn’t intended as a prank,
but rather, as a question. Could the opening and closing
of a piano lid be music? What about the click of a stopwatch? The rustling, and perhaps even the
complaining, of a crowd? Like the white canvases
of his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question 
their expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama
of some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong
emotional response. Cage’s work frequently prioritized
these spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances. He even developed processes that left some
compositional decisions up to chance. One of his favorite such systems
was the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text. Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers 
to produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted
to answer questions and offer fortunes. But Cage adapted these patterns
into a series of tables that generated different musical 
durations, tempos, and dynamics. Eventually, he even used early computers
to help produce these random parameters. For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions
notated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly
with the help of his guidelines. Some composers rejected Cage's
seemingly careless approach. They believed it was the composer’s job 
to organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose. After all, if these strange compositions 
were music, then where do we draw the line? But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't
want to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want
to follow old rules. He dedicated himself to shattering
our expectations, creating a series
of once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging 
musicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected.

2. Mentions the use of everyday objects as instruments, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ's focus on Cage reinventing existing musical instruments.
3. Has a similar intent, which is to understand how Cage challenged traditional notions of music.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not directly ask about Cage reinventing a specific existing musical instrument, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, the similarity is not exact, but rather based on the broader context of Cage's approach to music composition.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Transcript**:
In 1960, American composer John Cage 
went on national television to share his latest work. But rather than employing
traditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded 
by household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes,
a toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios. Armed with these tools and a stopwatch,
he performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds
with a serious expression and incredible precision. Some viewers found
the performance hysterical, while others thought it was
completely absurd. But most people watching likely shared 
the same question: is this even music? This question is harder to answer
than you might think. What we determine as music often
depends on our expectations. For example, imagine you’re 
in a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns. Most people would agree
that this is music. But if you were on the highway hearing
the same thing, many would call it noise. After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t 
musicians... right? Expectations like these influence how
we categorize everything we hear. We typically think something sounds 
more musical if it uses a recognizable structure 
or popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns. And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific
instruments and harmonies. These expectations are based 
on existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone. They vary across different cultures
and time periods. And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing 
the boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover 
what new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints. He began pioneering new instruments
that blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent
existing instruments. He also explored new ways for music
to mingle with other art forms. He and his creative and romantic partner,
Merce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music
and Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently
before being performed together. But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question
the boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence. Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s
most famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing
but musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds. This wasn’t intended as a prank,
but rather, as a question. Could the opening and closing
of a piano lid be music? What about the click of a stopwatch? The rustling, and perhaps even the
complaining, of a crowd? Like the white canvases
of his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question 
their expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama
of some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong
emotional response. Cage’s work frequently prioritized
these spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances. He even developed processes that left some
compositional decisions up to chance. One of his favorite such systems
was the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text. Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers 
to produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted
to answer questions and offer fortunes. But Cage adapted these patterns
into a series of tables that generated different musical 
durations, tempos, and dynamics. Eventually, he even used early computers
to help produce these random parameters. For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions
notated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly
with the help of his guidelines. Some composers rejected Cage's
seemingly careless approach. They believed it was the composer’s job 
to organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose. After all, if these strange compositions 
were music, then where do we draw the line? But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't
want to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want
to follow old rules. He dedicated himself to shattering
our expectations, creating a series
of once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging 
musicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected.

**Transcript**:
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old. And when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toy makers in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their best-selling products. So, allow me to tell you about it. So, I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And, so what better gift for someone, for a kid who wanted to be a chef, than an Easy Bake Oven, right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then, he started to realize something. In the commercials and on the boxes for the Easy Bake Oven, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens, and it would be in bright pink and purple. Very gender-specific colors to females, right? So, it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook. Boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef. because that was something girls did. Girls cooked, boys didn't. Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking, "God, I wish there was a way I could change this, that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro, so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it." And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform, where you can create a petition and share it across all these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so, I created a petition, along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition, basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. So, this petititon started to take off, like humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. (Applause) Thank you. So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me, in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist. I could change something that, even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered. And your voice matters, too! I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From username Liquidsword29, interesting usernames we have here, "Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay." Liquidsword29, really? Really? Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS, "People always need something to 'female dog' about." From Jeffrey Gutierrez, "OMG shut up! You just want money and attention." So, it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, "People don't care. People think it's a waste of time. And people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family." It hurt me. And it made me think, "What's the point in making change in the future?" But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me! One, two, three, Haters gonna hate! So let your haters hate, you know what! And make your change because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change. And I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can, too, because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in. And you can trade it across all the social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of chefs who are male, while the generated MCQs focus on McKenna Pope's story and her experience with the Easy Bake Oven petition.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 8: "What can be inferred about Hasbro's target audience based on their marketing strategy before McKenna Pope's petition?" This question is related to the topic of gender and marketing, which is also relevant to the ground truth MCQ about the percentage of male chefs.

But please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of chef demographics.

**Transcript**:
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old. And when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toy makers in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their best-selling products. So, allow me to tell you about it. So, I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And, so what better gift for someone, for a kid who wanted to be a chef, than an Easy Bake Oven, right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then, he started to realize something. In the commercials and on the boxes for the Easy Bake Oven, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens, and it would be in bright pink and purple. Very gender-specific colors to females, right? So, it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook. Boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef. because that was something girls did. Girls cooked, boys didn't. Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking, "God, I wish there was a way I could change this, that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro, so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it." And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform, where you can create a petition and share it across all these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so, I created a petition, along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition, basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. So, this petititon started to take off, like humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. (Applause) Thank you. So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me, in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist. I could change something that, even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered. And your voice matters, too! I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From username Liquidsword29, interesting usernames we have here, "Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay." Liquidsword29, really? Really? Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS, "People always need something to 'female dog' about." From Jeffrey Gutierrez, "OMG shut up! You just want money and attention." So, it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, "People don't care. People think it's a waste of time. And people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family." It hurt me. And it made me think, "What's the point in making change in the future?" But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me! One, two, three, Haters gonna hate! So let your haters hate, you know what! And make your change because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change. And I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can, too, because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in. And you can trade it across all the social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question is about using social media to spread a message and gather support, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about the number of social networking sites available to try and start change in America. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the theme of using social media to create change.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is more focused on the number of social networking sites available, while the generated MCQs are more focused on the story and themes presented in the transcript.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 7, but I would also suggest creating a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. 

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: How many social media platforms did McKenna Pope mention as being available to share her petition and spread her message?
Options: A. 2, B. 5, C. 6 or more
Correct Option: C

This new generated MCQ more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content, and would be a better match than any of the original generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old. And when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toy makers in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their best-selling products. So, allow me to tell you about it. So, I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And, so what better gift for someone, for a kid who wanted to be a chef, than an Easy Bake Oven, right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then, he started to realize something. In the commercials and on the boxes for the Easy Bake Oven, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens, and it would be in bright pink and purple. Very gender-specific colors to females, right? So, it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook. Boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef. because that was something girls did. Girls cooked, boys didn't. Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking, "God, I wish there was a way I could change this, that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro, so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it." And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform, where you can create a petition and share it across all these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so, I created a petition, along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition, basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. So, this petititon started to take off, like humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. (Applause) Thank you. So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me, in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist. I could change something that, even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered. And your voice matters, too! I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From username Liquidsword29, interesting usernames we have here, "Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay." Liquidsword29, really? Really? Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS, "People always need something to 'female dog' about." From Jeffrey Gutierrez, "OMG shut up! You just want money and attention." So, it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, "People don't care. People think it's a waste of time. And people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family." It hurt me. And it made me think, "What's the point in making change in the future?" But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me! One, two, three, Haters gonna hate! So let your haters hate, you know what! And make your change because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change. And I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can, too, because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in. And you can trade it across all the social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
By 1973, Harvey Milk had already been many things: naval officer, high school teacher, bit-part actor, and wandering hippie. But as he embarked on yet another life 
running a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings 
on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform. Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting 
up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture 
of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government. This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative 
for his own district, which included the heart of 
American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, 
discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as 
political outsiders. But Milk refused to 
downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never 
be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without 
representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these 
basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality. But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for 
the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history. Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy 
with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum, especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6. The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked 
the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, 
if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, 
to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign 
against hate. On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was 
gaining traction. But just twenty days after this 
inspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco 
Mayor George Moscone. Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those 
he called "radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey 
at Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change 
which Milk personified for many. The night of Milk's murder, thousands marched by candlelight 
through the city. In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven 
years and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar 
throughout the city in what became known as 
the White Night Riots. But even after his death, Milk continued to preach 
his hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total 
of three different tapes to be played in the event 
of his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome
in the fight against injustice: "I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy 
every closet door…”

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What was the outcome of Harvey Milk's first two bids for the Board of Supervisors? 

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks how many times Harvey Milk ran for public office before he was finally elected. A more accurate match would be a generated question that directly asks about the number of times Harvey Milk ran for office.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will provide an alternative solution. To answer the ground truth MCQ, we can infer the information from Question 4 and other parts of the transcript. According to the transcript, Harvey Milk lost his first bid for the Board of Supervisors in 1973, lost again in 1975, and also lost a bid for the California Assembly in 1976 before finally winning the seat in 1977.

Considering the available generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match, but it does not directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
By 1973, Harvey Milk had already been many things: naval officer, high school teacher, bit-part actor, and wandering hippie. But as he embarked on yet another life 
running a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings 
on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform. Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting 
up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture 
of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government. This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative 
for his own district, which included the heart of 
American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, 
discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as 
political outsiders. But Milk refused to 
downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never 
be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without 
representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these 
basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality. But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for 
the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history. Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy 
with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum, especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6. The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked 
the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, 
if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, 
to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign

**Transcript**:
One day, while hiding in the kitchen, Charlotte Brooks overheard 
a life-changing secret. At the age of 17, she’d been 
separated from her family and taken to William Neyland’s 
Texas Plantation. There, she was made to do housework 
at the violent whims of her enslavers. On that fateful day, she learned that
slavery had recently been abolished, but Neyland conspired to keep 
this a secret from those he enslaved. Hearing this, Brooks stepped out of her
hiding spot, proclaimed her freedom, spread the news throughout the plantation,
and ran. That night, she returned
for her daughter, Tempie. And before Neyland’s spiteful bullets
could find them, they were gone for good. For more than two centuries, slavery defined what would become 
the United States— from its past as the 13 British colonies 
to its growth as an independent country. Slavery fueled its cotton industry 
and made it a leading economic power. 10 of the first 12 presidents
enslaved people. And when US chattel slavery finally ended, it was a long and uneven process. Enslaved people resisted 
from the beginning— by escaping, breaking tools, 
staging rebellions, and more. During the American Revolution, Vermont
and Massachusetts abolished slavery while several states took steps
towards gradual abolition. In 1808, federal law banned the import
of enslaved African people, but it allowed the slave trade
to continue domestically. Approximately 4 million people
were enslaved in the US when Abraham Lincoln was
elected president in 1860. Lincoln opposed slavery, 
and though he had no plans to outlaw it, his election caused panic 
in Southern states, which began withdrawing from the Union. they vowed to uphold slavery
and formed the Confederacy, triggering the start 
of the American Civil War. A year into the conflict, Lincoln
abolished slavery in Washington, D.C., legally freeing more than 3,000 people. And five months later, he announced
the Emancipation Proclamation. It promised freedom to the 3.5 million
people enslaved in Confederate states. But it would only be fulfilled if the
rebelling states didn’t rejoin the Union by January 1st, 1863. And it bore no mention of the roughly
500,000 people in bondage in the border states of Delaware,
Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri that hadn’t seceded. When the Confederacy refused to surrender, Union soldiers began 
announcing emancipation. But many Southern areas remained
under Confederate control, making it impossible to actually implement
abolition throughout the South. The war raged on for two more years,
and on January 31st, 1865, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. It promised to end slavery
throughout the US— except as punishment for a crime. But to go into effect, 27 states
would have to ratify it first. Meanwhile, the Civil War
virtually ended with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee
on April 9th, 1865. But although slavery was technically
illegal in all Southern states, it still persisted in the last
bastions of the Confederacy. There, enslavers like Neyland continued
to evade abolition until forced. This was also the case when Union General
Gordon Granger marched his troops into Galveston, Texas, on June 19th and announced that all enslaved people
there were officially free— and had been for more than two years. Still, at this point, people remained 
legally enslaved in the border states. It wasn’t until more than five months
later, on December 6th, 1865, that the 13th Amendment
was finally ratified. This formally ended chattel slavery
in the US. Because official emancipation
was a staggered process, people in different places commemorated
it on different dates. Those in Galveston, Texas, began
celebrating “Juneteenth”— a combination of “June” and “nineteenth”— on the very first anniversary 
of General Granger’s announcement. Over time, smaller Juneteenth gatherings
gave way to large parades. And the tradition eventually became the most widespread 
of emancipation celebrations. But, while chattel slavery 
had officially ended, racial inequality, oppression,
and terror had not. Celebrating emancipation was itself
an act of continued resistance. And it wasn't until 2021 that Juneteenth
became a federal holiday. Today, Juneteenth holds profound
significance as a celebration of the demise of slavery, the righteous
pursuit of true freedom for all, and a continued pledge to remember
the past and dream the future.

at the violent whims of her enslavers. On that fateful day, she learned that
slavery had recently been abolished, but Neyland conspired to keep 
this a secret from those he enslaved. Hearing this, Brooks stepped out of her
hiding spot, proclaimed her freedom, spread the news throughout the plantation,
and ran. That night, she returned
for her daughter, Tempie. And before Neyland’s spiteful bullets
could find them, they were gone for good. For more than two centuries, slavery defined what would become 
the United States— from its past as the 13 British colonies 
to its growth as an independent country. Slavery fueled its cotton industry 
and made it a leading economic power. 10 of the first 12 presidents
enslaved people. And when US chattel slavery finally ended, it was a long and uneven process. Enslaved people resisted 
from the beginning— by escaping, breaking tools, 
staging rebellions, and more. During the American Revolution, Vermont
and Massachusetts abolished slavery while several states took steps
towards gradual abolition. In 1808, federal law banned the import
of enslaved African people, but it allowed the slave trade
to continue domestically. Approximately 4 million people
were enslaved in the US when Abraham Lincoln was
elected president in 1860. Lincoln opposed slavery, 
and though he had no plans to outlaw it, his election caused panic 
in Southern states, which began withdrawing from the Union. they vowed to uphold slavery
and formed the Confederacy, triggering the start 
of the American Civil War. A year into the conflict, Lincoln
abolished slavery in Washington, D.C., legally freeing more than 3,000 people. And five months later, he announced
the Emancipation Proclamation. It promised freedom to the 3.5 million
people enslaved in Confederate states. But it would only be fulfilled if the
rebelling states didn’t rejoin the Union by January 1st, 1863. And it bore no mention of the roughly
500,000 people in bondage in the border states of Delaware,
Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri that hadn’t seceded. When the Confederacy refused to surrender, Union soldiers began 
announcing emancipation. But many Southern areas remained
under Confederate control, making it impossible to actually implement
abolition throughout the South. The war raged on for two more years,
and on January 31st, 1865, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. It promised to end slavery
throughout the US— except as punishment for a crime. But to go into effect, 27 states
would have to ratify it first. Meanwhile, the Civil War
virtually ended with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee
on April 9th, 1865. But although slavery was technically
illegal in all Southern states, it still persisted in the last
bastions of the Confederacy. There, enslavers like Neyland continued
to evade abolition until forced. This was also the case when Union General
Gordon Granger marched his troops into Galveston, Texas, on June 19th and announced that all enslaved people
there were officially free— and had been for more than two years. Still, at this point, people remained 
legally enslaved in the border states. It wasn’t until more than five months
later, on December 6th, 1865, that the 13th Amendment
was finally ratified. This formally ended chattel slavery
in the US. Because official emancipation
was a staggered process, people in different places commemorated
it on different dates. Those in Galveston, Texas, began
celebrating “Juneteenth”— a combination of “June” and “nineteenth”— on the very first anniversary 
of General Granger’s announcement. Over time, smaller Juneteenth gatherings
gave way to large parades. And the tradition eventually became the most widespread 
of emancipation celebrations. But, while chattel slavery 
had officially ended, racial inequality, oppression,
and terror had not. Celebrating emancipation was itself
an act of continued resistance. And it wasn't until 2021 that Juneteenth
became a federal holiday. Today, Juneteenth holds profound
significance as a celebration of the demise of slavery, the righteous
pursuit of true freedom for all, and a continued pledge to remember
the past and dream the future.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the approximate number of enslaved people living in the United States at the onset of the Civil War. But Question 2 does mention the labor of enslaved people and their contribution to the US cotton industry, which is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the number of enslaved people. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 5 is not the closest match, but Question 3 has some relevant information. According to the transcript, "Approximately 4 million people were enslaved in the US when Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860." 

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to pick one, I would say it is Question 3, with the understanding that it is not an exact match.

This question aligns with the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent, as it also deals with the scope and limitations of the Emancipation Proclamation. Although the wording and options are not identical, Question 5 addresses the same underlying concept as the ground truth MCQ, which is the specific groups of enslaved people that were affected by the Emancipation Proclamation.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. It also deals with the Emancipation Proclamation's impact on enslaved people, specifically those living in Confederate states.

Between Questions 3 and 5, Question 5 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the specific information being asked, which is the groups of enslaved people that were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What was the primary purpose of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution? 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of the question are similar to the ground truth MCQ, which asks when slavery finally ended in the United States. The correct option for Question 4, "to abolish slavery throughout the US, except as punishment for a crime," aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, which states that slavery ended with the passing of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.

However, another generated MCQ (Question 7) also addresses the topic of the end of slavery, but its focus is on the ultimate outcome of the American Civil War for the institution of slavery, rather than the specific date or event that marked the end of slavery.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but with some differences in wording and focus.

**Transcript**:
To survive in this high pressured, crazy world most of us have to become highly adept at self-criticism. We learn how to tell ourselves off for our failures and for not working hard or smart enough. But so good are we at this that we're sometimes in danger of falling prey to an excessive form of self-criticism What we might call self-flagellation a rather dangerous state which just ushers in depression and under-performance. We might simply lose the will to get out of bed. For those moments, we need a corrective. We need to carve out time for an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious. Self-compassion. We're suspicious because that sounds horribly close to self-pity But because depression and self-hatred are serious enemies of a good life, we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life. To this end we can perform what we've called a, "self-compassion exercise" A structured meditation, lasting 15 minutes or so Lying in bed, or perhaps a bath Turn over a sequence of thoughts that interrupt and correct the flow of your worse self-accusations. For a time adopt an entire kindly perspective on your setbacks The self compassion exercise goes like this: We're so in love with success we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we've tried to achieve. We've failed, but given the mountain we were trying to climb, the conclusion doesn't have to be that we're simply flawless. We have tricky family histories, we all do. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain some of our current troubles. We're not entirely sane or well, but none of us are. We weren't well set up to carry out certain tasks It isn't wholly our fault in the here and now. From the media, you'd think everyone was rich and famous and successful. But in reality, undramatic, quiet failure is by a huge margin the statistical norm. We shouldn't tear ourselves apart for not managing to be to what were in truth, awesome odds. Tough, self-critical people don't allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck. They take responsibility for everything. They think winners make their own luck But they don't for the most part. Luck is a genuine feature of existence We're robbing ourselves of fair concilation By believing that we're entirely in control, and therefore entirely to blame when we crash. You are not only your achievements. Status and material success are one bit of you. But there are others as well, those who loved you in childhood knew this, and in their best moments helped you to feel it. Rehearse the internalized voices of all those who have been kind to you. Bathe in the memory of a laugh independent of achievement. It seems it will never end That's not the truth It's just how a crisis feels. You need to reduce expectations to zero for a time. Take each new hour as it comes, and without being banal, what you need most of all, is some rest.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not contain a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the duration of the self-compassion exercise. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of the exercise, I would say:

 Question 2: What is the main goal of the self-compassion exercise described in the transcript?

This question is not a direct match, but it is related to the self-compassion exercise, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a generated MCQ that directly asks about the duration of the self-compassion exercise. If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would say:

**Transcript**:
LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral

**Transcript**:
LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral
failure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that
any politician's appearance can affect their electability
shouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at
a female politician's face might influence your vote
should give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing
how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics

judgments are, I think, is something that's

powerful a first impression can be just might make you think

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3 and Question 9 are related but not exact matches**

However, the most similar generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ is not present. But we can create a new question by combining Question 3 and Question 9.

But if we had to choose from the existing questions, the closest match would be:

**Question 3: If you perceive a face as potentially threatening, which part of your brain is likely to react?**

This question is related to the amygdala, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ. However, the options and the question intent are not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **3** (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

To create a more similar question, we could rephrase Question 3 to match the ground truth MCQ:

**New Question: What is the role of the amygdala in processing faces?**
Options: A. processes fearful expressions of other people, B. motivates rapid responses to threats, C. quickly judges perceived trustworthiness, D. all of the above

This new question would be a more exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the provided list. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content and intent of the questions.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what flows in when neurons in the brain start to be activated. The correct answer is "both oxygen and glucose." 

Although there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 9 discusses how the brain processes the trustworthiness of a face, mentioning that the brain can process the trustworthiness of a face without even perceptual awareness. However, it does not specifically mention what flows in when neurons are activated.

If I had to choose a question that is vaguely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 9. However, I want to emphasize that this is not a direct match.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ. 

Here is the index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9

**Transcript**:
LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral
failure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that
any politician's appearance can affect their electability
shouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at
a female politician's face might influence your vote
should give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing
how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics
about another person and how powerful these
judgments are, I think, is something that's
really startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how
powerful a first impression can be just might make you think
twice before you judge a face. For Science Friday,
I'm Luke Groskin.

think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral
failure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that
any politician's appearance can affect their electability
shouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at
a female politician's face might influence your vote
should give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing
how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics
about another person and how powerful these
judgments are, I think, is something that's
really startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how
powerful a first impression can be just might make you think
twice before you judge a face. For Science Friday,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the provided list. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content and intent of the questions.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what flows in when neurons in the brain start to be activated. The correct answer is "both oxygen and glucose." 

Although there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 9 discusses how the brain processes the trustworthiness of a face, mentioning that the brain can process the trustworthiness of a face without even perceptual awareness. However, it does not specifically mention what flows in when neurons are activated.

If I had to choose a question that is vaguely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 9. However, I want to emphasize that this is not a direct match.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ. 

Here is the index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9

**Transcript**:
LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3 and Question 9 are related but not exact matches**

However, the most similar generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ is not present. But we can create a new question by combining Question 3 and Question 9.

But if we had to choose from the existing questions, the closest match would be:

**Question 3: If you perceive a face as potentially threatening, which part of your brain is likely to react?**

This question is related to the amygdala, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ. However, the options and the question intent are not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **3** (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

To create a more similar question, we could rephrase Question 3 to match the ground truth MCQ:

**New Question: What is the role of the amygdala in processing faces?**
Options: A. processes fearful expressions of other people, B. motivates rapid responses to threats, C. quickly judges perceived trustworthiness, D. all of the above

This new question would be a more exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A canvas drenched in sunset hues,
colors radiating like flame. At first glance, this painting may appear 
to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals 
the tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture 
of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects
into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work 
of Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter 
and sculptor. But the magic behind 
this transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent
her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago 
to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her 
to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude 
and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little 
personal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was 
increasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors 
of Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher 
whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students
to focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s
first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present 
a series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching,
any specific natural reference. Earlier European painters 
in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry
to abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed 
the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these 
would soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement 
called American Modernism. Although no single style defines 
Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire 
to challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, 
Modernist painting often used geometric shapes 
and bold colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself 
into these experiments — but she was reluctant 
to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals
to the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged 
for a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s
career as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead 
to marriage in 1924. Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s
taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint 
for months at a time. Whether she was exploring 
the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, 
or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on 
ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention 
to small details, and spent hours mixing paints 
to create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue,
she’d record it in her ever-growing collection
of handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented 
with perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In "Rams Head with Hollyhock," she places a weathered skull 
and a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows 
the landscape, casting both the skeleton 
and the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was captivated by her 
unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised 
for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies 
to ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time 
were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings
to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed 
such interpretations. She resented the male gaze 
that dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation 
of the natural world. Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down 
in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s
mysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating 
until her death at 98, and is remembered as 
the “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains 
its wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique.

**Transcript**:
A canvas drenched in sunset hues,
colors radiating like flame. At first glance, this painting may appear 
to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals 
the tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture 
of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects
into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work 
of Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter 
and sculptor. But the magic behind 
this transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent
her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago 
to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her 
to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude 
and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little 
personal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was 
increasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors 
of Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher 
whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students
to focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s
first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present 
a series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching,
any specific natural reference. Earlier European painters 
in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry
to abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed 
the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these 
would soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement 
called American Modernism. Although no single style defines 
Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire 
to challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, 
Modernist painting often used geometric shapes 
and bold colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself 
into these experiments — but she was reluctant 
to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals
to the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged 
for a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s
career as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead 
to marriage in 1924. Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s
taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint 
for months at a time. Whether she was exploring 
the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, 
or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on 
ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention 
to small details, and spent hours mixing paints 
to create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue,
she’d record it in her ever-growing collection
of handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented 
with perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In "Rams Head with Hollyhock," she places a weathered skull 
and a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows 
the landscape, casting both the skeleton 
and the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was captivated by her 
unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised 
for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies 
to ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time 
were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings
to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed 
such interpretations. She resented the male gaze 
that dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation 
of the natural world. Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down 
in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s
mysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating 
until her death at 98, and is remembered as 
the “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains 
its wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially relates to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the objects O'Keeffe often painted, including flowers, bones, and leaves. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the objects she painted, Question 6 mentions her creative process involving close observation and recording colors, which might be tangentially related to her painting style and subjects.

However, a more relevant connection can be made with Question 7, which mentions the public's response to her unique perspective and secretive behavior, particularly in relation to her massive flower paintings. Although this question does not directly ask about the objects she painted, it does touch on her artistic subjects and style.

Given the available options, I would suggest that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is still not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Over the course of the 1960s, the FBI amassed almost 
two thousand documents in an investigation into one 
of America’s most celebrated minds. The subject of this inquiry 
was a writer named James Baldwin. At the time, the FBI investigated many 
artists and thinkers, but most of their files were a 
fraction the size of Baldwin’s. During the years when the FBI hounded him, he became one of the best-selling
black authors in the world. So what made James Baldwin loom 
so large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities? Born in Harlem in 1924, he was the oldest of nine children. At age fourteen,
he began to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons,
he developed his voice as a writer, but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him 
away from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life. Constantly confronted with racism 
and homophobia, he was angry and disillusioned, 
and yearned for a less restricted life. So in 1948, 
at the age of 24, he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship. From France, he published his first novel, "Go Tell it on the Mountain," in 1953. Set in Harlem, the book explores the Church 
as a source of both repression and hope. It was popular with both black 
and white readers. As he earned acclaim for his fiction, Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, 
class, culture and exile in his 1955 extended essay, 
"Notes of a Native Son." Meanwhile, the Civil Rights movement 
was gaining momentum in America. Black Americans were making incremental 
gains at registering to vote and voting, but were still denied basic dignities in 
schools, on buses, in the work force, and in the armed services. Though he lived primarily in France 
for the rest of his life, Baldwin was deeply invested in 
the movement, and keenly aware of his 
country’s unfulfilled promise. He had seen family, friends, 
and neighbors spiral into addiction, incarceration
and suicide. He believed their fates originated 
from the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published "The Fire Next Time," an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America 
accountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed 
in the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history 
and history is trapped in them.” Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights 
movement went beyond observing and reporting. He also traveled through the 
American South attending rallies giving lectures 
of his own. He debated both white politicians 
and black activists, including Malcolm X, and served as a liaison between black 
activists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders 
like Robert Kennedy. Because of Baldwin’s unique ability to articulate the causes 
of social turbulence in a way that white audiences 
were willing to hear, Kennedy and others tended to see 
him as an ambassador for black Americans — a label Baldwin rejected. And at the same time, his faculty with words led the 
FBI to view him as a threat. Even within the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin could sometimes feel 
like an outsider for his choice to live abroad,
as well as his sexuality, which he explored openly 
in his writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant. Throughout his life, Baldwin considered it his role
to bear witness. Unlike many of his peers, he lived to see some of the
victories of the Civil Rights movement, but the continuing racial inequalities in 
the United States weighed heavily on him. Though he may have felt trapped 
in his moment in history, his words have made generations 
of people feel known, while guiding them toward a more 
nuanced understanding of society’s most complex issues.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks for the reason behind the move, not the destination. 

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the destination of James Baldwin's move in 1948. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if we had to choose the closest match, it would be:

**Question 1: Where was James Baldwin born? Options: A. Paris, France, B. Harlem, New York, C. Los Angeles, California, D. Chicago, Illinois Correct Option: B**

This question is about a location related to James Baldwin's life, but it's about his birthplace, not the place he moved to in 1948.

However, there is another question that mentions Paris, France, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

So, the closest match would be:

**Question 1 is not the best match, Question 3 is a better match, but it does not ask the same question, it asks for the reason, not the destination.**

Since none of the questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that has the closest relation to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Over the course of the 1960s, the FBI amassed almost 
two thousand documents in an investigation into one 
of America’s most celebrated minds. The subject of this inquiry 
was a writer named James Baldwin. At the time, the FBI investigated many 
artists and thinkers, but most of their files were a 
fraction the size of Baldwin’s. During the years when the FBI hounded him, he became one of the best-selling
black authors in the world. So what made James Baldwin loom 
so large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities? Born in Harlem in 1924, he was the oldest of nine children. At age fourteen,
he began to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons,
he developed his voice as a writer, but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him 
away from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life. Constantly confronted with racism 
and homophobia, he was angry and disillusioned, 
and yearned for a less restricted life. So in 1948, 
at the age of 24, he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship. From France, he published his first novel, "Go Tell it on the Mountain," in 1953. Set in Harlem, the book explores the Church 
as a source of both repression and hope. It was popular with both black 
and white readers. As he earned acclaim for his fiction, Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, 
class, culture and exile in his 1955 extended essay, 
"Notes of a Native Son." Meanwhile, the Civil Rights movement 
was gaining momentum in America. Black Americans were making incremental 
gains at registering to vote and voting, but were still denied basic dignities in 
schools, on buses, in the work force, and in the armed services. Though he lived primarily in France 
for the rest of his life, Baldwin was deeply invested in 
the movement, and keenly aware of his 
country’s unfulfilled promise. He had seen family, friends, 
and neighbors spiral into addiction, incarceration
and suicide. He believed their fates originated 
from the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published "The Fire Next Time," an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America 
accountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed 
in the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history 
and history is trapped in them.” Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights 
movement went beyond observing and reporting. He also traveled through the 
American South attending rallies giving lectures 
of his own. He debated both white politicians 
and black activists, including Malcolm X, and served as a liaison between black 
activists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders 
like Robert Kennedy. Because of Baldwin’s unique ability to articulate the causes 
of social turbulence in a way that white audiences 
were willing to hear, Kennedy and others tended to see 
him as an ambassador for black Americans — a label Baldwin rejected. And at the same time, his faculty with words led the 
FBI to view him as a threat. Even within the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin could sometimes feel 
like an outsider for his choice to live abroad,
as well as his sexuality, which he explored openly 
in his writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant. Throughout his life, Baldwin considered it his role
to bear witness. Unlike many of his peers, he lived to see some of the
victories of the Civil Rights movement, but the continuing racial inequalities in 
the United States weighed heavily on him. Though he may have felt trapped 
in his moment in history, his words have made generations 
of people feel known, while guiding them toward a more 
nuanced understanding of society’s most complex issues.

**Transcript**:
Love is often described as heartwarming,
heart-wrenching and even heartbreaking. So, what does the brain have
to do with it? Everything! The journey from first spark to last tear
is guided by a symphony of neurochemicals and brain systems. As you begin to fall for someone, you may find yourself excessively
daydreaming about them and wanting to spend more and more
time together. This first stage of love is what
psychologists call infatuation, or passionate love. Your new relationship
can feel almost intoxicating, and when it comes to the brain,
that’s not far from the truth. Infatuated individuals show increased
activation in the ventral tegmental area. The VTA is the reward-processing 
and motivation hub of the brain, firing when you do things like 
eat a sweet treat, quench your thirst, or in more extreme cases,
take drugs of abuse. Activation releases the “feel good”
neurotransmitter dopamine, teaching your brain to repeat behaviors 
in anticipation of receiving the same initial reward. This increased VTA activity is the
reason love's not only euphoric, but also draws you towards
your new partner. At this first stage, it may be hard to see
any faults in your new perfect partner. This haze is thanks
to love’s influence on higher cortical brain regions. Some newly infatuated individuals
show decreased activity in the brain’s cognitive center, 
the prefrontal cortex. As activation of this region allows us 
to engage in critical thought and pass judgment, it’s not surprising we tend to see 
new relationships through rose-colored glasses. While this first stage of love can be an intense rollercoaster of emotions
and brain activity, it typically only lasts a few months, making way for the more long-lasting
stage of love, known as attachment,
or compassionate love. As your relationship develops, you may feel more relaxed 
and committed to your partner thanks in large part to two hormones:
oxytocin and vasopressin. Known as pair-bonding hormones, they signal trust, 
feelings of social support and attachment. In this way, romantic love 
is not unlike other forms of love, as these hormones also help bond
families and friendships. Further, oxytocin can inhibit 
the release of stress hormones, which is why spending time 
with a loved one can feel so relaxing. As early love's suspension
of judgment fades, it can be replaced by a more honest
understanding and deeper connection. Alternatively, as your rose-colored
glasses begin to lose their tint, problems in your relationship
may become more evident. No matter the reason 
a relationship ends, we can blame the pain that accompanies
heartbreak on the brain. The distress of a breakup activates
the insular cortex, a region that processes pain— both physical, 
like spraining your ankle, as well as social, 
like the feelings of rejection. As days pass, you may find yourself
once again daydreaming about or craving contact with your lost partner. The drive to reach out may
feel overwhelming, like an extreme hunger or thirst. When looking at photos
of a former partner, heartbroken individuals again show
increased activity in the VTA, the motivation and reward center 
that drove feelings of longing during the initial stages 
of the relationship. This emotional whirlwind also likely
activates your body’s alarm system, the stress axis, leaving you feeling 
shaken and restless. As time goes on, higher cortical regions which oversee 
reasoning and impulse control, can pump the brakes on this distress
and craving signaling. Given that these regions
are still maturing and making connections
through adolescence, it's no wonder that first heartbreak
can feel particularly agonizing. Activities like exercise, 
spending time with friends, or even listening to your favorite song can tame this heartbreak stress response, while also triggering the release 
of feel good neurotransmitter dopamine. And given time and the support, most can heal and learn from even
the most devastating heartbreak.

**Transcript**:
Love is often described as heartwarming,
heart-wrenching and even heartbreaking. So, what does the brain have
to do with it? Everything! The journey from first spark to last tear
is guided by a symphony of neurochemicals and brain systems. As you begin to fall for someone, you may find yourself excessively
daydreaming about them and wanting to spend more and more
time together. This first stage of love is what
psychologists call infatuation, or passionate love. Your new relationship
can feel almost intoxicating, and when it comes to the brain,
that’s not far from the truth. Infatuated individuals show increased
activation in the ventral tegmental area. The VTA is the reward-processing 
and motivation hub of the brain, firing when you do things like 
eat a sweet treat, quench your thirst, or in more extreme cases,
take drugs of abuse. Activation releases the “feel good”
neurotransmitter dopamine, teaching your brain to repeat behaviors 
in anticipation of receiving the same initial reward. This increased VTA activity is the
reason love's not only euphoric, but also draws you towards
your new partner. At this first stage, it may be hard to see
any faults in your new perfect partner. This haze is thanks
to love’s influence on higher cortical brain regions. Some newly infatuated individuals
show decreased activity in the brain’s cognitive center, 
the prefrontal cortex. As activation of this region allows us 
to engage in critical thought and pass judgment, it’s not surprising we tend to see 
new relationships through rose-colored glasses. While this first stage of love can be an intense rollercoaster of emotions
and brain activity, it typically only lasts a few months, making way for the more long-lasting
stage of love, known as attachment,
or compassionate love. As your relationship develops, you may feel more relaxed 
and committed to your partner thanks in large part to two hormones:
oxytocin and vasopressin. Known as pair-bonding hormones, they signal trust, 
feelings of social support and attachment. In this way, romantic love 
is not unlike other forms of love, as these hormones also help bond
families and friendships. Further, oxytocin can inhibit 
the release of stress hormones, which is why spending time 
with a loved one can feel so relaxing. As early love's suspension
of judgment fades, it can be replaced by a more honest
understanding and deeper connection. Alternatively, as your rose-colored
glasses begin to lose their tint, problems in your relationship
may become more evident. No matter the reason 
a relationship ends, we can blame the pain that accompanies
heartbreak on the brain. The distress of a breakup activates
the insular cortex, a region that processes pain— both physical, 
like spraining your ankle, as well as social, 
like the feelings of rejection. As days pass, you may find yourself
once again daydreaming about or craving contact with your lost partner. The drive to reach out may
feel overwhelming, like an extreme hunger or thirst. When looking at photos
of a former partner, heartbroken individuals again show
increased activity in the VTA, the motivation and reward center 
that drove feelings of longing during the initial stages 
of the relationship. This emotional whirlwind also likely
activates your body’s alarm system, the stress axis, leaving you feeling 
shaken and restless. As time goes on, higher cortical regions which oversee 
reasoning and impulse control, can pump the brakes on this distress
and craving signaling. Given that these regions
are still maturing and making connections
through adolescence, it's no wonder that first heartbreak
can feel particularly agonizing. Activities like exercise, 
spending time with friends, or even listening to your favorite song can tame this heartbreak stress response, while also triggering the release 
of feel good neurotransmitter dopamine. And given time and the support, most can heal and learn from even
the most devastating heartbreak.

**Transcript**:
Following a devastating nuclear war, Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali. These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species’ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other. The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into 
the biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish? Questions like this haunt 
Octavia Butler’s "Dawn," the first in her trilogy "Lilith’s Brood." A visionary storyteller who 
upended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds 
throughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep 
us awake at night. Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in 
Pasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these 
scenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother 
for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction
film called "Devil Girl From Mars." Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story. Much science fiction features 
white male heroes who blast aliens or become 
saviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters
for diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the 
representation of their experiences. For Butler, imagination was not only for planting 
the seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an 
unjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling 
features of the world such as discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate 
them in new contexts. One of her most beloved novels, the "Parable of the Sower," follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future
California, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that 
causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance 
with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an 
ever-changing world. Lauren’s quest had roots 
in a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented
immigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated 
contemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the 
Sower," "Parable of the Talents," she wrote of a presidential candidate who controls Americans with virtual 
reality and “shock collars.” His slogan? “Make America great again.” While people have noted her prescience, Butler was also interested in 
re-examining history. For instance,
"Kindred" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly
pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation 
of her ancestors. Early on, she learns that her mission 
is to save the life of the white man who will rape her great grandmother. If she doesn’t save him, 
she herself will cease to exist. This grim dilemma forces Dana to 
confront the ongoing trauma of slavery and sexual violence 
against Black women. With her stories of women 
founding new societies, time travelers overcoming 
historical strife, and interspecies bonding, Butler had a profound influence on 
the growing popularity of Afrofuturism. That’s a cultural movement where Black writers and artists who are 
inspired by the past, present and future, produce works that incorporate magic, 
history, technology and much more. As Lauren comes to learn in 
"Parable of the Sower," "All that you touch you Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change.”

contemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the 
Sower," "Parable of the Talents," she wrote of a presidential candidate who controls Americans with virtual 
reality and “shock collars.” His slogan? “Make America great again.” While people have noted her prescience, Butler was also interested in 
re-examining history. For instance,
"Kindred" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly
pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation 
of her ancestors. Early on, she learns that her mission 
is to save the life of the white man who will rape her great grandmother. If she doesn’t save him, 
she herself will cease to exist. This grim dilemma forces Dana to 
confront the ongoing trauma of slavery and sexual violence 
against Black women. With her stories of women 
founding new societies, time travelers overcoming 
historical strife, and interspecies bonding, Butler had a profound influence on 
the growing popularity of Afrofuturism. That’s a cultural movement where Black writers and artists who are 
inspired by the past, present and future, produce works that incorporate magic, 
history, technology and much more. As Lauren comes to learn in 
"Parable of the Sower," "All that you touch you Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change.”

**Transcript**:
Following a devastating nuclear war, Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali. These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species’ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other. The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into 
the biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish? Questions like this haunt 
Octavia Butler’s "Dawn," the first in her trilogy "Lilith’s Brood." A visionary storyteller who 
upended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds 
throughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep 
us awake at night. Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in 
Pasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these 
scenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother 
for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction
film called "Devil Girl From Mars." Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story. Much science fiction features 
white male heroes who blast aliens or become 
saviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters
for diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the 
representation of their experiences. For Butler, imagination was not only for planting 
the seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an 
unjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling 
features of the world such as discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate 
them in new contexts. One of her most beloved novels, the "Parable of the Sower," follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future
California, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that 
causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance 
with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an 
ever-changing world. Lauren’s quest had roots 
in a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented
immigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated 
contemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and context of the ground truth MCQ, I can identify a generated MCQ that is somewhat related.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the alien species in "Dawn," and the correct answer is "Oankali." Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 mentions the Oankali, but it asks about the primary condition they offer to humanity in exchange for not sterilizing the entire human race.

Although there isn't a direct match, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it is the only one that mentions the Oankali. However, please note that it does not directly ask about the alien species' name.

**Transcript**:
It’s easy to feel like you’re an even
mix of your parents, but that’s not always the case. So, who should you be blaming over those traits
you don’t like? What did you inherit from Mom and what came
from Dad? Colour-blind? If you’re a male, you can thank your mother. Red-green colour blindness is an X-linked
disorder that affects nearly 6% of the male population worldwide, but only 0.4% of females. This is because males only inherit one X chromosome,
which is from their mother, and that’s where red-green colorblindness comes from. If you’re a female, you have to get a the
X-variant from both parents. So that 0.4% can blame dad as well! Balding? A big component comes from the X-chromosome
here too, so you likely inherited this from your mom. However, a study involving 52,000 people found
that genes on other chromosomes can affect this condition, on top of environmental factors
such as age, stress, and diet - so mom isn’t entirely to blame! Research has also found that the shape of
the end of your nose, the area above and below the lips, cheekbones and the inner corner
of the eye are highly influenced by genetics. And interestingly, the more they resemble
your father as a child, the healthier you’re likely to be. Why? Scientists believe that a father-child resemblance
causes fathers to spend more time engaging in positive parenting, which ultimately contributes
to healthier kids. Now, even though you get half of your 46 chromosomes
from mom and the other from dad, a study involving genetically diverse mice found that for 60%
of genes the paternal copy was more active than the maternal copy. This phenomenon is known as allelic imbalance. The same study also noted that the brains
of these particular mice more closely resembled that of their dad than their mom. However, in humans we actually see the opposite. Our brains are more similar to our mother,
which is particularly true for daughters. Interestingly, the similar brain regions are
actually associated with depressive conditions, suggesting that mood disorders may pass from
mother to daughter. Biologists used to believe that all DNA came
from the nucleus, but we now know that the mitochondria (AKA the powerhouse of the cell)
also kicks in some protein coding genes. And this mitochondrial DNA is specifically
inherited from your mom because your dad’s degraded immediately after fertilization. Considering how important mitochondrial DNA
is in the cell, there is a stronger maternal link. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been associated
with Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease - which more likely came from your mom. Maternal inheritance gave rise to the idea
of a “Mitochondrial Eve”, a woman who lived between 180,000 to 580,000 years ago
from which all human mitochondrial DNA is rooted. At the end of the day, it may seem like a
lot of traits actually come from your mom, or at least, from the X chromosome - and that’s
generally true, genetically. The Y-chromosome is very small, and doesn’t
contain as many genes; and both females and males contain X-chromosomes, which carry more
genes. But as we continue to research more about
ourselves at the genetic level, the division between what you got from mom vs. dad may
become even more pronounced. If you want to know more about your own genetics,
you can visit 23andMe.com/asap, who sponsored this episode. Whether you want to know about your chances
of balding, back hair, your taste sense or where your ancestors came from, 23andMe’s
kit will get you started. We both took it, and I found out the GREAT
news that I’m more prone to having a little upper back hair, which until recently I thought

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of intent and content.

However, a more relevant question is Question 4, which mentions that a person is more likely to inherit certain traits from their mother due to mitochondrial DNA mutations. This question is related to the idea that the X chromosome, which is inherited from the mother, carries more genes and is more influential in determining traits.

But the most relevant question is actually not present among the generated MCQs. The closest match would be a question that directly compares the influence of the X and Y chromosomes on trait inheritance.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 4, as it is the closest in terms of intent and content.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the options don't exactly match, the question content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the source of DNA, and one of the correct options is "Mitochondria". Question 9 asks why mitochondrial DNA is specifically inherited from the mother, which is related to the source of DNA. However, a more closely related question could be one that asks about the source of DNA, which is not present among the generated MCQs.

A more suitable match could be a generated MCQ that asks, "DNA comes from which of the following?" or "What is a source of DNA in addition to the nucleus?" Since such a question is not present among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest match based on the content and intent.

**Transcript**:
when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

**Transcript**:
when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his

my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne

when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but it is related to the concept of introversion and extroversion. However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about a person who falls in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum.

The closest match is not available, but I can suggest a possible reason. The ground truth MCQ is focused on a specific term ("ambivert") that is mentioned in the transcript, but it is not a central theme or concept. The generated MCQs are more focused on the main ideas and concepts discussed in the transcript, such as the differences between introversion and extroversion, the importance of solitude, and the cultural bias towards extroverts.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, which asks about the primary difference between shyness and introversion. However, this is not a direct match, and I would not recommend it as a suitable replacement for the ground truth MCQ.

In this case, I would suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the term "ambivert" and its definition, rather than trying to find a match among the existing generated MCQs.

read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted

Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my

crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

**Transcript**:
when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

**Transcript**:
What if William Shakespeare had a sister
who matched his imagination, his wit, and his way with words? Would she have gone to school
and set the stage alight? In her essay "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf argues that this would
have been impossible. She concocts a fictional sister
who's stuck at home, snatching time to scribble a few pages before she finds herself
betrothed and runs away. While her brother finds fame and fortune,
she remains abandoned and anonymous. In this thought experiment, Woolf demonstrates the tragedy
of genius restricted, and looks back through time for hints
of these hidden histories. She wrote, "When one reads 
of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man
who had a mother, then I think we're on the track
of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen." "A Room of One's Own" considers a world
denied great works of art due to exclusion and inequality. How best can we understand
the internal experience of alienation? In both her essays and fiction, Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature 
of subjective experience into words. Her characters frequently lead inner lives
that are deeply at odds with their external existence. To help make sense of these disparities,
the next time you read Woolf, here are some aspects of her life
and work to consider. She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen
in 1882 to a large and wealthy family, which enabled her to pursue a life
in the arts. The death of her mother in 1895
was followed by that of her half-sister, father, and brother 
within the next ten years. These losses led to Woolf's first
depressive episode and subsequent institutionalization. As a young woman, she purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area 
of London with her siblings. This brought her into contact
with a circle of creatives, including E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, and Leonard Woolf. These friends became known
as the Bloomsbury Group, and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912. The members of this group were prominent
figures in Modernism, a cultural movement that sought
to push the boundaries of how reality is represented. Key features of Modernist writing include
the use of stream of consciousness, interior monologue, distortions in time, and multiple or shifting perspectives. These appear in the work of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Woolf herself. While reading Joyce's "Ulysses,"
Woolf began writing "Mrs. Dalloway." Like "Ulysses," the text takes place
over the course of a single day and opens under seemingly
mundane circumstances. "Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself." But the novel dives deeply
into the characters' traumatic pasts, weaving the inner world of numbed
socialite Clarissa Dalloway, with that of the shell-shocked veteran
Septimus Warren Smith. Woolf uses interior monologue
to contrast the rich world of the mind against her characters' 
external existences. In her novel "To the Lighthouse," mundane moments, like a dinner party,
or losing a necklace trigger psychological revelations
in the lives of the Ramsay's, a fictionalized version 
of Woolf's family growing up. "To the Lighthouse" also contains
one of the most famous examples of Woolf's radical representation of time. In the Time Passes section, ten years are distilled 
into about 20 pages. Here, the lack of human presence
in the Ramsays' beach house allows Woolf to reimagine time
in flashes and fragments of prose. "The house was left. 
The house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sand hill
to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it." In her novel "The Waves," there is little distinction between
the narratives of the six main characters. Woolf experiments 
with collective consciousness, at times collapsing the six voices
into one. "It is not one life that I look back upon: I am not one person: 
I am many people: I do not altogether know who I am, Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis, or how to distinguish 
my life from their's." In "The Waves," six become one,
but in the gender-bending "Orlando," a single character 
inhabits multiple identities. The protagonist is a poet who switches
between genders and lives for 300 years. With its fluid language 
and approach to identity, "Orlando" is considered 
a key text in gender studies. The mind can only fly 
so far from the body before it returns 
to the constraints of life. Like many of her characters,
Woolf's life ended in tragedy when she drowned herself at the age of 59. Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering. Through deep thought,
Woolf's characters are shown to temporarily transcend 
their material reality, and in its careful consideration
of the complexity of the mind, her work charts the importance of making
our inner lives known to each other.

**Transcript**:
What if William Shakespeare had a sister
who matched his imagination, his wit, and his way with words? Would she have gone to school
and set the stage alight? In her essay "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf argues that this would
have been impossible. She concocts a fictional sister
who's stuck at home, snatching time to scribble a few pages before she finds herself
betrothed and runs away. While her brother finds fame and fortune,
she remains abandoned and anonymous. In this thought experiment, Woolf demonstrates the tragedy
of genius restricted, and looks back through time for hints
of these hidden histories. She wrote, "When one reads 
of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man
who had a mother, then I think we're on the track
of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen." "A Room of One's Own" considers a world
denied great works of art due to exclusion and inequality. How best can we understand
the internal experience of alienation? In both her essays and fiction, Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature 
of subjective experience into words. Her characters frequently lead inner lives
that are deeply at odds with their external existence. To help make sense of these disparities,
the next time you read Woolf, here are some aspects of her life
and work to consider. She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen
in 1882 to a large and wealthy family, which enabled her to pursue a life
in the arts. The death of her mother in 1895
was followed by that of her half-sister, father, and brother 
within the next ten years. These losses led to Woolf's first
depressive episode and subsequent institutionalization. As a young woman, she purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area 
of London with her siblings. This brought her into contact
with a circle of creatives, including E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, and Leonard Woolf. These friends became known
as the Bloomsbury Group, and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912. The members of this group were prominent
figures in Modernism, a cultural movement that sought
to push the boundaries of how reality is represented. Key features of Modernist writing include
the use of stream of consciousness, interior monologue, distortions in time, and multiple or shifting perspectives. These appear in the work of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Woolf herself. While reading Joyce's "Ulysses,"
Woolf began writing "Mrs. Dalloway." Like "Ulysses," the text takes place
over the course of a single day and opens under seemingly
mundane circumstances. "Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself." But the novel dives deeply
into the characters' traumatic pasts, weaving the inner world of numbed
socialite Clarissa Dalloway, with that of the shell-shocked veteran
Septimus Warren Smith. Woolf uses interior monologue
to contrast the rich world of the mind against her characters' 
external existences. In her novel "To the Lighthouse," mundane moments, like a dinner party,
or losing a necklace trigger psychological revelations
in the lives of the Ramsay's, a fictionalized version 
of Woolf's family growing up. "To the Lighthouse" also contains
one of the most famous examples of Woolf's radical representation of time. In the Time Passes section, ten years are distilled 
into about 20 pages. Here, the lack of human presence
in the Ramsays' beach house allows Woolf to reimagine time
in flashes and fragments of prose. "The house was left. 
The house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sand hill
to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it." In her novel "The Waves," there is little distinction between
the narratives of the six main characters. Woolf experiments 
with collective consciousness, at times collapsing the six voices
into one. "It is not one life that I look back upon: I am not one person: 
I am many people: I do not altogether know who I am, Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis, or how to distinguish 
my life from their's." In "The Waves," six become one,
but in the gender-bending "Orlando," a single character 
inhabits multiple identities. The protagonist is a poet who switches
between genders and lives for 300 years. With its fluid language 
and approach to identity, "Orlando" is considered 
a key text in gender studies. The mind can only fly 
so far from the body before it returns 
to the constraints of life. Like many of her characters,
Woolf's life ended in tragedy when she drowned herself at the age of 59. Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering. Through deep thought,

**Transcript**:
What if William Shakespeare had a sister
who matched his imagination, his wit, and his way with words? Would she have gone to school
and set the stage alight? In her essay "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf argues that this would
have been impossible. She concocts a fictional sister
who's stuck at home, snatching time to scribble a few pages before she finds herself
betrothed and runs away. While her brother finds fame and fortune,
she remains abandoned and anonymous. In this thought experiment, Woolf demonstrates the tragedy
of genius restricted, and looks back through time for hints
of these hidden histories. She wrote, "When one reads 
of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man
who had a mother, then I think we're on the track
of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen." "A Room of One's Own" considers a world
denied great works of art due to exclusion and inequality. How best can we understand
the internal experience of alienation? In both her essays and fiction, Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature 
of subjective experience into words. Her characters frequently lead inner lives
that are deeply at odds with their external existence. To help make sense of these disparities,
the next time you read Woolf, here are some aspects of her life
and work to consider. She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen
in 1882 to a large and wealthy family, which enabled her to pursue a life
in the arts. The death of her mother in 1895
was followed by that of her half-sister, father, and brother 
within the next ten years. These losses led to Woolf's first
depressive episode and subsequent institutionalization. As a young woman, she purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area 
of London with her siblings. This brought her into contact
with a circle of creatives, including E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, and Leonard Woolf. These friends became known
as the Bloomsbury Group, and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912. The members of this group were prominent
figures in Modernism, a cultural movement that sought
to push the boundaries of how reality is represented. Key features of Modernist writing include
the use of stream of consciousness, interior monologue, distortions in time, and multiple or shifting perspectives. These appear in the work of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Woolf herself. While reading Joyce's "Ulysses,"
Woolf began writing "Mrs. Dalloway." Like "Ulysses," the text takes place
over the course of a single day and opens under seemingly
mundane circumstances. "Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself." But the novel dives deeply
into the characters' traumatic pasts, weaving the inner world of numbed
socialite Clarissa Dalloway, with that of the shell-shocked veteran
Septimus Warren Smith. Woolf uses interior monologue
to contrast the rich world of the mind against her characters' 
external existences. In her novel "To the Lighthouse," mundane moments, like a dinner party,
or losing a necklace trigger psychological revelations
in the lives of the Ramsay's, a fictionalized version 
of Woolf's family growing up. "To the Lighthouse" also contains
one of the most famous examples of Woolf's radical representation of time. In the Time Passes section, ten years are distilled 
into about 20 pages. Here, the lack of human presence
in the Ramsays' beach house allows Woolf to reimagine time
in flashes and fragments of prose. "The house was left. 
The house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sand hill
to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it." In her novel "The Waves," there is little distinction between
the narratives of the six main characters. Woolf experiments 
with collective consciousness, at times collapsing the six voices
into one. "It is not one life that I look back upon: I am not one person: 
I am many people: I do not altogether know who I am, Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis, or how to distinguish 
my life from their's." In "The Waves," six become one,
but in the gender-bending "Orlando," a single character 
inhabits multiple identities. The protagonist is a poet who switches
between genders and lives for 300 years. With its fluid language 
and approach to identity, "Orlando" is considered 
a key text in gender studies. The mind can only fly 
so far from the body before it returns 
to the constraints of life. Like many of her characters,
Woolf's life ended in tragedy when she drowned herself at the age of 59. Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering. Through deep thought,
Woolf's characters are shown to temporarily transcend 
their material reality, and in its careful consideration
of the complexity of the mind, her work charts the importance of making
our inner lives known to each other.

**Transcript**:
         When I was a kid, I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing. I thought they were both pork chops. And because my grandmother thought it was cute   and because they were my favourite she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. One day, before I realized fat kids are not 
designed to climb trees I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body I didn't want to tell my grandmother about it because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere that I shouldn't have been. A few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise and I got sent to the principal's office. From there I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home. I saw no reason to lie. As far as I was concerned life was pretty good I told her, "Whenever I'm sad my grandmother gives me karate chops." This led to a full scale investigation and I was removed from the house for three days... until they finally decided to ask 
how I got the bruises. News of this silly little story quickly spread
through the school and I earned my first nickname: Pork Chop. To this day... I hate pork chops. I'm not the only kid who grew up this way. Surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme... about sticks and stones As if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called, and we got called them all. So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us. That we'd be lonely forever. That we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool shed. So broken heart strings bled the blues as we tried to empty ourselves so we would feel nothing. Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone. That an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away That there's no way for it to metastasize It does. She was eight years old... Our first day of grade three when she got called "ugly." We both got moved to the back of the class so we would stop getting bombarded by spit balls But the school halls were a battleground where we found ourselves outnumbered
day after wretched day. We used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse. Outside we'd have to rehearse running away   or learn to stay still like statues giving
no clues that we were there. In grade five they taped a sign to her desk that read "Beware of Dog." To this day, despite a loving husband, She doesn't think she's beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half of her face. Kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase but couldn't quite get the job done. And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word "Mom." Because they see her heart before they see her skin. That she's only ever always been amazing. He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree. Adopted but not because his parents opted
for a different destiny. He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy. Started therapy in 8th grade. Had a personality made up of tests and pills. Lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs. Four fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of anti-depressants, and an adolescence of being called "Popper." One part because of the pills and ninety nine parts because of the cruelty. He tried to kill himself in grade ten when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him "get over it."  As if depression is something 
that can be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit. To this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends, could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moments before it's about to fall and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration, he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes becoming drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity. We weren't the only kids who grew up this way. To this day kids are still being called names. The classics were "Hey stupid" "Hey spaz" Seems like each school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear do they make a sound? Are they just the background noise of a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like "kids can be cruel"? Every school was a big top circus tent and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers, from clowns to carnies. All of these were miles ahead of who we were. We were freaks. Lobster claw boys and bearded ladies Oddities Juggling depression and loneliness, 
playing Solitaire, spin the bottle, Trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal. But at night, while the others slept We kept walking the tightrope. It was practice and yeah, some of us fell. But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris, leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be.   And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror. Look a little closer. Stare a little longer. Because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit. You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself. You signed it, "they were wrong." Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or clique. Maybe they decided to pick you last
for basketball or everything. Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it? You have to believe that they were wrong They have to be wrong.
Why else would we still be here? We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them. We stem from a root planted in the belief That we are not what we were called We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting
empty on a highway. And if in some way we are, don't worry. We only got out to walk and get gas. We are graduating members from the class of "we made it." Not the faded echoes of voices crying out "names will never hurt me." Of course, they did.
But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain... and more to do with beauty.

**Transcript**:
Adjusting her disguise, Zhu Yingtai 
prepared to bid her parents goodbye. She had always been a dutiful daughter—
staying home and creating works of embroidery
that brought her parents pride. And yet, although only boys were allowed
at the Confucius Academy in Hangzhou, what Yingtai truly wanted
was to go to school. She begged her parents 
to let her attend dressed as a boy and, seeing her determination 
and clever disguises, they finally agreed. However, they only gave her permission
when she promised to keep her true identity a secret and eventually return to the traditional
path they’d set for her. Elated, Yingtai began her journey
to Hangzhou. On the way, she found herself 
at a crossroads, unsure which route to take
when a young man approached. As their eyes met, 
they shared an instant connection. Yingtai learned that his name was 
Liang Shanbo, and that he’d be her classmate
at the academy, so they walked the rest 
of the way together, rapt in conversation. Yingtai realized that, 
despite her meticulous disguise, she felt that she could
finally be herself. The two decided to celebrate 
what they thought would be a long, close friendship, 
and became sworn brothers. At the academy, 
Yingtai buried herself in books and studied with Shanbo 
late into the nights. The two felt at home so long as they were
at each other’s sides. They shared a room, but even though
Shanbo questioned her about it, Yingtai always used the bathroom alone and buttoned her thick robes 
up to her chin— no matter the weather. Now and again, Yingtai heard students
muttering about her secretive behavior. As months slipped into years,
Yingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past—
and intended future—were lifetimes away. Yet the whispers grew louder. And after three years,
she had no choice but to leave. Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo
to visit her. When Yingtai returned home, her parents announced that the Ma family
from the neighboring village had sent a matchmaker 
to ask their permission for Yingtai to marry their son. They’d found it a fitting match
and accepted. Trying to hide her disappointment, 
Yingtai honored their agreement. But as she prepared for another new life,
she thought of Shanbo. Meanwhile, he too was distracted—
his studies dull without Yingtai near. When Shanbo finally visited 
Yingtai’s house, he came upon a young woman. He was about to ask for her brother, but as their eyes met, he recognized 
the young scholar he’d always loved. Shanbo knew he couldn’t stand
being separated from Yingtai again and asked her to marry him. But, heartbroken, Yingtai told him 
that she was already promised to another. Shanbo was devastated, but he understood
that Yingtai had to abide by her parents’ wishes, 
and they parted again. Shanbo fell ill and grew weaker
by the day. Worried, his family sent a matchmaker
to the Zhu family. But, because of Yingtai’s 
current engagement, her father refused the proposal. Doing otherwise would bring their family
public shame. Shanbo’s Illness took a turn for the worse and, sensing he wouldn’t live
to see her married, Shanbo wrote Yingtai a final letter. If Yingtai loved him,
he asked that she burn incense in front of his tomb 
when she was on her way to the Ma family. When Yingtai’s wedding day came,
it also felt like a funeral. As the procession wound through town
under stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt
in front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices
through her tears. Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded above and a lightning bolt shot 
through the tomb, fracturing the stone. Without hesitation, 
Yingtai threw herself in. As her parents rushed 
to rescue their daughter, two butterflies fluttered 
out of the crack. This time, Yingtai had transformed 
for good. Finally free, she could float forever 
with Shanbo at her side.

muttering about her secretive behavior. As months slipped into years,
Yingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past—
and intended future—were lifetimes away. Yet the whispers grew louder. And after three years,
she had no choice but to leave. Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo
to visit her. When Yingtai returned home, her parents announced that the Ma family
from the neighboring village had sent a matchmaker 
to ask their permission for Yingtai to marry their son. They’d found it a fitting match
and accepted. Trying to hide her disappointment, 
Yingtai honored their agreement. But as she prepared for another new life,
she thought of Shanbo. Meanwhile, he too was distracted—
his studies dull without Yingtai near. When Shanbo finally visited 
Yingtai’s house, he came upon a young woman. He was about to ask for her brother, but as their eyes met, he recognized 
the young scholar he’d always loved. Shanbo knew he couldn’t stand
being separated from Yingtai again and asked her to marry him. But, heartbroken, Yingtai told him 
that she was already promised to another. Shanbo was devastated, but he understood
that Yingtai had to abide by her parents’ wishes, 
and they parted again. Shanbo fell ill and grew weaker
by the day. Worried, his family sent a matchmaker
to the Zhu family. But, because of Yingtai’s 
current engagement, her father refused the proposal. Doing otherwise would bring their family
public shame. Shanbo’s Illness took a turn for the worse and, sensing he wouldn’t live
to see her married, Shanbo wrote Yingtai a final letter. If Yingtai loved him,
he asked that she burn incense in front of his tomb 
when she was on her way to the Ma family. When Yingtai’s wedding day came,
it also felt like a funeral. As the procession wound through town
under stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt
in front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices
through her tears. Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded above and a lightning bolt shot 
through the tomb, fracturing the stone. Without hesitation, 
Yingtai threw herself in. As her parents rushed 
to rescue their daughter, two butterflies fluttered 
out of the crack. This time, Yingtai had transformed 
for good. Finally free, she could float forever 
with Shanbo at her side.

**Transcript**:
Adjusting her disguise, Zhu Yingtai 
prepared to bid her parents goodbye. She had always been a dutiful daughter—
staying home and creating works of embroidery
that brought her parents pride. And yet, although only boys were allowed
at the Confucius Academy in Hangzhou, what Yingtai truly wanted
was to go to school. She begged her parents 
to let her attend dressed as a boy and, seeing her determination 
and clever disguises, they finally agreed. However, they only gave her permission
when she promised to keep her true identity a secret and eventually return to the traditional
path they’d set for her. Elated, Yingtai began her journey
to Hangzhou. On the way, she found herself 
at a crossroads, unsure which route to take
when a young man approached. As their eyes met, 
they shared an instant connection. Yingtai learned that his name was 
Liang Shanbo, and that he’d be her classmate
at the academy, so they walked the rest 
of the way together, rapt in conversation. Yingtai realized that, 
despite her meticulous disguise, she felt that she could
finally be herself. The two decided to celebrate 
what they thought would be a long, close friendship, 
and became sworn brothers. At the academy, 
Yingtai buried herself in books and studied with Shanbo 
late into the nights. The two felt at home so long as they were
at each other’s sides. They shared a room, but even though
Shanbo questioned her about it, Yingtai always used the bathroom alone and buttoned her thick robes 
up to her chin— no matter the weather. Now and again, Yingtai heard students
muttering about her secretive behavior. As months slipped into years,
Yingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past—
and intended future—were lifetimes away. Yet the whispers grew louder. And after three years,
she had no choice but to leave. Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo

**Transcript**:
On August 28th, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom. That day, nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence, and economic exclusion 
black people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated 
facilities from within. Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people who could help further 
messages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights 
were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the 
party’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the 
peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies 
for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before. His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963, when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality. Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march he delivered the
marchers' demands in a speech directed at 
President John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly,
without any violence. It has been credited with helping pass 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places 
and banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory 
voting practices. In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political 
issues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough 
of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate
with the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his 
former communist affiliation. But ultimately, both his belief
in collaboration with the government 
and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire
to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible. Rustin was passed over for several 
influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay,
and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis
until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously 
awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s 
“march towards true equality, no matter who we are 
or who we love.”

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reason for Bayard Rustin's jailing in 1944. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this event, Question 3 mentions Rustin's experience in India and his adoption of peaceful resistance strategies inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. However, it does not directly relate to the reason for his jailing in 1944.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that mentions Rustin's pacifism, conscientious objection, or his imprisonment. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address these topics.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, but with a note that it is not a direct match.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the reason for Bayard Rustin's jailing in 1944.

**Transcript**:
On August 28th, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom. That day, nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence, and economic exclusion 
black people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated 
facilities from within. Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people who could help further 
messages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights 
were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the 
party’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the 
peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies 
for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before. His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963, when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality. Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march he delivered the
marchers' demands in a speech directed at 
President John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly,
without any violence. It has been credited with helping pass 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places 
and banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory 
voting practices. In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political 
issues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough 
of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate
with the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his 
former communist affiliation. But ultimately, both his belief
in collaboration with the government 
and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire
to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible. Rustin was passed over for several 
influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay,
and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis
until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously 
awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s 
“march towards true equality, no matter who we are 
or who we love.”

**Transcript**:
More than 2,500 years ago, one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated 
popstars and erotic poets enraptured listeners. In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard
his nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked 
the boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said. So, who was this revered figure? Her name was Sappho. She lived on the Greek island 
of Lesbos around 600 BCE. Like other singer-songwriters of the time, she sang while playing the lyre, a stringed instrument from which
the term “lyrics” is derived. But Sappho lyrics offered a uniquely
intimate perspective on love, passion, and longing. She’s the first on record to combine the 
words “bitter” and “sweet,” for instance, to describe at once the thrills 
and devastations of romance. Sappho was an aristocrat thought
to have married a man, though none of her surviving
work mentions him. It does reference other family
as well as festivals, colorful clothing, and growing old. But Sappho is best known for her lyrics
about homoerotic desire for women. In one song, as her female companion
departs tearfully, Sappho says, “let me remind you /
... the lovely times we shared.” She describes flower garlands, perfumes,
“and,” she says, “on soft beds / 
... you quenched your desire.” In another, she describes 
a friend in a distant city, “Pacing far away, her gentle heart
devoured by powerful desire, she remembers slender Atthis.” The word “Lesbian” means 
someone from Lesbos, but, because of Sappho, 
it now also describes a woman who’s gay. In ancient Greece, the norm was 
for everyone to marry and have children. While men were usually permitted to have
homosexual relationships based on their status, 
women weren’t. But it appears that, 
on Lesbos at this time, aristocratic women generally
had more freedom. Yet the details of Sappho’s
life remain mysterious, partially because only fragments 
of her poetry survive. In ancient times, however, 
so much of it persisted that it seemed it would last forever. Admirers performed Sappho cover songs
and committed her poetry to papyrus, parchment, and pottery. Three centuries after Sappho’s death, a Greek author declared that her words
would endure “as long as ships sail from the Nile.” Another century later, the Library of  Alexandria housed 
nine scrolls of her work, numbering over 10,000 lines. But natural forces eroded the collection. And monks, tasked with preserving 
ancient writing, likely neglected or destroyed her work. One 2nd century Christian leader 
called Sappho “a whore who sang about her
own licentiousness.” Later, a Pope and Archbishop
ordered her poetry burned. Almost all of it had vanished
by the Middle Ages. Then, about a century ago, people began rediscovering 
Sappho’s poetry— in locations like an ancient Egyptian 
garbage dump. Now, we have around 700 lines, representing less than 10%
of Sappho’s total known work. We only have one complete poem of hers. About a dozen others are substantial,
but most are mere fragments. New pieces of Sappho’s songs 
probably will be found. Some may already be sitting 
in museum archives, to be revealed when technology 
allows scholars to read through scrolls 
too fragile to unroll. What we are currently left 
with is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors. Ovid insisted that Sappho fell 
in love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected,
leapt from a cliff to her death. Another tale asserts that she ran 
a girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems
were merely students for whom she felt platonic affection. Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho 
or deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts
of misogyny and homophobia. Despite the distortions 
of the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time
and resonate today. More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time

**Transcript**:
More than 2,500 years ago, one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated 
popstars and erotic poets enraptured listeners. In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard
his nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked 
the boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said. So, who was this revered figure? Her name was Sappho. She lived on the Greek island 
of Lesbos around 600 BCE. Like other singer-songwriters of the time, she sang while playing the lyre, a stringed instrument from which
the term “lyrics” is derived. But Sappho lyrics offered a uniquely
intimate perspective on love, passion, and longing. She’s the first on record to combine the 
words “bitter” and “sweet,” for instance, to describe at once the thrills 
and devastations of romance. Sappho was an aristocrat thought
to have married a man, though none of her surviving
work mentions him. It does reference other family
as well as festivals, colorful clothing, and growing old. But Sappho is best known for her lyrics
about homoerotic desire for women. In one song, as her female companion
departs tearfully, Sappho says, “let me remind you /
... the lovely times we shared.” She describes flower garlands, perfumes,
“and,” she says, “on soft beds / 
... you quenched your desire.” In another, she describes 
a friend in a distant city, “Pacing far away, her gentle heart
devoured by powerful desire, she remembers slender Atthis.” The word “Lesbian” means 
someone from Lesbos, but, because of Sappho,

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1960, American composer John Cage 
went on national television to share his latest work. But rather than employing
traditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded 
by household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes,
a toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios. Armed with these tools and a stopwatch,
he performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds
with a serious expression and incredible precision. Some viewers found
the performance hysterical, while others thought it was
completely absurd. But most people watching likely shared 
the same question: is this even music? This question is harder to answer
than you might think. What we determine as music often
depends on our expectations. For example, imagine you’re 
in a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns. Most people would agree
that this is music. But if you were on the highway hearing
the same thing, many would call it noise. After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t 
musicians... right? Expectations like these influence how
we categorize everything we hear. We typically think something sounds 
more musical if it uses a recognizable structure 
or popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns. And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific
instruments and harmonies. These expectations are based 
on existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone. They vary across different cultures
and time periods. And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing 
the boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover 
what new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints. He began pioneering new instruments
that blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent
existing instruments. He also explored new ways for music
to mingle with other art forms. He and his creative and romantic partner,
Merce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music
and Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently
before being performed together. But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question
the boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence. Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s
most famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing
but musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds. This wasn’t intended as a prank,
but rather, as a question. Could the opening and closing
of a piano lid be music? What about the click of a stopwatch? The rustling, and perhaps even the
complaining, of a crowd? Like the white canvases
of his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question 
their expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama
of some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong
emotional response. Cage’s work frequently prioritized
these spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances. He even developed processes that left some
compositional decisions up to chance. One of his favorite such systems
was the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text. Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers 
to produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted
to answer questions and offer fortunes. But Cage adapted these patterns
into a series of tables that generated different musical 
durations, tempos, and dynamics. Eventually, he even used early computers
to help produce these random parameters. For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions
notated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly
with the help of his guidelines. Some composers rejected Cage's
seemingly careless approach. They believed it was the composer’s job 
to organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose. After all, if these strange compositions 
were music, then where do we draw the line? But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't
want to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want
to follow old rules. He dedicated himself to shattering
our expectations, creating a series
of once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging 
musicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected.

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is highly relevant to the ground truth question, as both questions are about the instruments used in John Cage's "Water Walk" performance. However, the generated question is more general and asks about multiple instruments, whereas the ground truth question asks about a specific instrument.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.8000 (The correct answer option in the generated question does not exactly match the ground truth answer, but it does include the rubber duck as part of the correct answer option D. However, the generated question's correct answer is more comprehensive and includes other instruments used in the performance.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.7000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible, but they could be improved. Option B is a good distractor, as it includes common musical instruments that were not used in the performance. However, options A and C are not as effective, as they include items that were actually used in the performance, making them less plausible as distractors.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (The generated question and options are clear and easy to understand. The language is concise, and the question is well-structured.)

**Transcript**:
In 1960, American composer John Cage 
went on national television to share his latest work. But rather than employing
traditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded 
by household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes,
a toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios. Armed with these tools and a stopwatch,
he performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds
with a serious expression and incredible precision. Some viewers found
the performance hysterical, while others thought it was
completely absurd. But most people watching likely shared 
the same question: is this even music? This question is harder to answer
than you might think. What we determine as music often
depends on our expectations. For example, imagine you’re 
in a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns. Most people would agree
that this is music. But if you were on the highway hearing
the same thing, many would call it noise. After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t 
musicians... right? Expectations like these influence how
we categorize everything we hear. We typically think something sounds 
more musical if it uses a recognizable structure 
or popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns. And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific
instruments and harmonies. These expectations are based 
on existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone. They vary across different cultures
and time periods. And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing 
the boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover 
what new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints. He began pioneering new instruments
that blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent
existing instruments. He also explored new ways for music
to mingle with other art forms. He and his creative and romantic partner,
Merce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music
and Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently
before being performed together. But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question
the boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence. Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s
most famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing
but musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds. This wasn’t intended as a prank,
but rather, as a question. Could the opening and closing
of a piano lid be music? What about the click of a stopwatch? The rustling, and perhaps even the
complaining, of a crowd? Like the white canvases
of his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question 
their expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama
of some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong
emotional response. Cage’s work frequently prioritized
these spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances. He even developed processes that left some
compositional decisions up to chance. One of his favorite such systems
was the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text. Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers 
to produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted
to answer questions and offer fortunes. But Cage adapted these patterns
into a series of tables that generated different musical 
durations, tempos, and dynamics. Eventually, he even used early computers
to help produce these random parameters. For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions
notated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly
with the help of his guidelines. Some composers rejected Cage's
seemingly careless approach. They believed it was the composer’s job 
to organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose. After all, if these strange compositions 
were music, then where do we draw the line? But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't
want to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want
to follow old rules. He dedicated himself to shattering
our expectations, creating a series
of once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging 
musicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected.

**Transcript**:
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old. And when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toy makers in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their best-selling products. So, allow me to tell you about it. So, I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And, so what better gift for someone, for a kid who wanted to be a chef, than an Easy Bake Oven, right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then, he started to realize something. In the commercials and on the boxes for the Easy Bake Oven, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens, and it would be in bright pink and purple. Very gender-specific colors to females, right? So, it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook. Boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef. because that was something girls did. Girls cooked, boys didn't. Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking, "God, I wish there was a way I could change this, that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro, so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it." And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform, where you can create a petition and share it across all these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so, I created a petition, along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition, basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. So, this petititon started to take off, like humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. (Applause) Thank you. So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me, in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist. I could change something that, even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered. And your voice matters, too! I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From username Liquidsword29, interesting usernames we have here, "Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay." Liquidsword29, really? Really? Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS, "People always need something to 'female dog' about." From Jeffrey Gutierrez, "OMG shut up! You just want money and attention." So, it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, "People don't care. People think it's a waste of time. And people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family." It hurt me. And it made me think, "What's the point in making change in the future?" But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me! One, two, three, Haters gonna hate! So let your haters hate, you know what! And make your change because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change. And I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can, too, because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in. And you can trade it across all the social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old. And when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toy makers in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their best-selling products. So, allow me to tell you about it. So, I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And, so what better gift for someone, for a kid who wanted to be a chef, than an Easy Bake Oven, right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then, he started to realize something. In the commercials and on the boxes for the Easy Bake Oven, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens, and it would be in bright pink and purple. Very gender-specific colors to females, right? So, it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook. Boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef. because that was something girls did. Girls cooked, boys didn't. Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking, "God, I wish there was a way I could change this, that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro, so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it." And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform, where you can create a petition and share it across all these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so, I created a petition, along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition, basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. So, this petititon started to take off, like humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. (Applause) Thank you. So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me, in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist. I could change something that, even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered. And your voice matters, too! I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From username Liquidsword29, interesting usernames we have here, "Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay." Liquidsword29, really? Really? Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS, "People always need something to 'female dog' about." From Jeffrey Gutierrez, "OMG shut up! You just want money and attention." So, it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, "People don't care. People think it's a waste of time. And people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family." It hurt me. And it made me think, "What's the point in making change in the future?" But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me! One, two, three, Haters gonna hate! So let your haters hate, you know what! And make your change because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change. And I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can, too, because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in. And you can trade it across all the social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
By 1973, Harvey Milk had already been many things: naval officer, high school teacher, bit-part actor, and wandering hippie. But as he embarked on yet another life 
running a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings 
on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform. Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting 
up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture 
of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government. This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative 
for his own district, which included the heart of 
American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, 
discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as 
political outsiders. But Milk refused to 
downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never 
be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without 
representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these 
basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality. But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for 
the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history. Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy 
with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum, especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6. The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked 
the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, 
if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, 
to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign 
against hate. On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was 
gaining traction. But just twenty days after this 
inspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco 
Mayor George Moscone. Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those 
he called "radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey 
at Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change 
which Milk personified for many. The night of Milk's murder, thousands marched by candlelight 
through the city. In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven 
years and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar 
throughout the city in what became known as 
the White Night Riots. But even after his death, Milk continued to preach 
his hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total 
of three different tapes to be played in the event 
of his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome
in the fight against injustice: "I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy 
every closet door…”

on national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform. Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting 
up stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture 
of cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government. This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative 
for his own district, which included the heart of 
American gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, 
discrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as 
political outsiders. But Milk refused to 
downplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never 
be won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without 
representation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these 
basic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality. But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for 
the Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district, befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history. Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy 
with this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum, especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6. The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked 
the LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, 
if indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, 
to your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign 
against hate. On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was 
gaining traction. But just twenty days after this 
inspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco 
Mayor George Moscone. Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those 
he called "radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey 
at Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change 
which Milk personified for many. The night of Milk's murder, thousands marched by candlelight 
through the city. In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven 
years and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar 
throughout the city in what became known as 
the White Night Riots. But even after his death, Milk continued to preach 
his hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total 
of three different tapes to be played in the event 
of his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome
in the fight against injustice: "I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy 
every closet door…”

**Transcript**:
One day, while hiding in the kitchen, Charlotte Brooks overheard 
a life-changing secret. At the age of 17, she’d been 
separated from her family and taken to William Neyland’s 
Texas Plantation. There, she was made to do housework 
at the violent whims of her enslavers. On that fateful day, she learned that
slavery had recently been abolished, but Neyland conspired to keep 
this a secret from those he enslaved. Hearing this, Brooks stepped out of her
hiding spot, proclaimed her freedom, spread the news throughout the plantation,
and ran. That night, she returned
for her daughter, Tempie. And before Neyland’s spiteful bullets
could find them, they were gone for good. For more than two centuries, slavery defined what would become 
the United States— from its past as the 13 British colonies 
to its growth as an independent country. Slavery fueled its cotton industry 
and made it a leading economic power. 10 of the first 12 presidents
enslaved people. And when US chattel slavery finally ended, it was a long and uneven process. Enslaved people resisted 
from the beginning— by escaping, breaking tools, 
staging rebellions, and more. During the American Revolution, Vermont
and Massachusetts abolished slavery while several states took steps
towards gradual abolition. In 1808, federal law banned the import
of enslaved African people, but it allowed the slave trade
to continue domestically. Approximately 4 million people
were enslaved in the US when Abraham Lincoln was
elected president in 1860. Lincoln opposed slavery, 
and though he had no plans to outlaw it, his election caused panic 
in Southern states, which began withdrawing from the Union. they vowed to uphold slavery
and formed the Confederacy, triggering the start 
of the American Civil War. A year into the conflict, Lincoln
abolished slavery in Washington, D.C., legally freeing more than 3,000 people. And five months later, he announced
the Emancipation Proclamation. It promised freedom to the 3.5 million
people enslaved in Confederate states. But it would only be fulfilled if the
rebelling states didn’t rejoin the Union by January 1st, 1863. And it bore no mention of the roughly
500,000 people in bondage in the border states of Delaware,
Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri that hadn’t seceded. When the Confederacy refused to surrender, Union soldiers began 
announcing emancipation. But many Southern areas remained
under Confederate control, making it impossible to actually implement
abolition throughout the South. The war raged on for two more years,
and on January 31st, 1865, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. It promised to end slavery
throughout the US— except as punishment for a crime. But to go into effect, 27 states
would have to ratify it first. Meanwhile, the Civil War
virtually ended with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee
on April 9th, 1865. But although slavery was technically
illegal in all Southern states, it still persisted in the last
bastions of the Confederacy. There, enslavers like Neyland continued
to evade abolition until forced. This was also the case when Union General
Gordon Granger marched his troops into Galveston, Texas, on June 19th and announced that all enslaved people
there were officially free— and had been for more than two years. Still, at this point, people remained 
legally enslaved in the border states. It wasn’t until more than five months
later, on December 6th, 1865, that the 13th Amendment
was finally ratified. This formally ended chattel slavery
in the US. Because official emancipation
was a staggered process, people in different places commemorated
it on different dates. Those in Galveston, Texas, began
celebrating “Juneteenth”— a combination of “June” and “nineteenth”— on the very first anniversary 
of General Granger’s announcement. Over time, smaller Juneteenth gatherings
gave way to large parades. And the tradition eventually became the most widespread 
of emancipation celebrations. But, while chattel slavery 
had officially ended, racial inequality, oppression,
and terror had not. Celebrating emancipation was itself
an act of continued resistance. And it wasn't until 2021 that Juneteenth
became a federal holiday. Today, Juneteenth holds profound
significance as a celebration of the demise of slavery, the righteous
pursuit of true freedom for all, and a continued pledge to remember
the past and dream the future.

rebelling states didn’t rejoin the Union by January 1st, 1863. And it bore no mention of the roughly
500,000 people in bondage in the border states of Delaware,
Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri that hadn’t seceded. When the Confederacy refused to surrender, Union soldiers began 
announcing emancipation. But many Southern areas remained
under Confederate control, making it impossible to actually implement
abolition throughout the South. The war raged on for two more years,
and on January 31st, 1865, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. It promised to end slavery
throughout the US— except as punishment for a crime. But to go into effect, 27 states
would have to ratify it first. Meanwhile, the Civil War
virtually ended with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee
on April 9th, 1865. But although slavery was technically
illegal in all Southern states, it still persisted in the last
bastions of the Confederacy. There, enslavers like Neyland continued
to evade abolition until forced. This was also the case when Union General
Gordon Granger marched his troops into Galveston, Texas, on June 19th and announced that all enslaved people
there were officially free— and had been for more than two years. Still, at this point, people remained 
legally enslaved in the border states. It wasn’t until more than five months
later, on December 6th, 1865, that the 13th Amendment
was finally ratified. This formally ended chattel slavery
in the US. Because official emancipation
was a staggered process, people in different places commemorated
it on different dates. Those in Galveston, Texas, began
celebrating “Juneteenth”— a combination of “June” and “nineteenth”— on the very first anniversary 
of General Granger’s announcement. Over time, smaller Juneteenth gatherings
gave way to large parades. And the tradition eventually became the most widespread 
of emancipation celebrations. But, while chattel slavery 
had officially ended, racial inequality, oppression,
and terror had not. Celebrating emancipation was itself
an act of continued resistance. And it wasn't until 2021 that Juneteenth
became a federal holiday. Today, Juneteenth holds profound
significance as a celebration of the demise of slavery, the righteous

One day, while hiding in the kitchen, Charlotte Brooks overheard 
a life-changing secret. At the age of 17, she’d been 
separated from her family and taken to William Neyland’s 
Texas Plantation. There, she was made to do housework 
at the violent whims of her enslavers. On that fateful day, she learned that
slavery had recently been abolished, but Neyland conspired to keep 
this a secret from those he enslaved. Hearing this, Brooks stepped out of her
hiding spot, proclaimed her freedom, spread the news throughout the plantation,
and ran. That night, she returned
for her daughter, Tempie. And before Neyland’s spiteful bullets
could find them, they were gone for good. For more than two centuries, slavery defined what would become 
the United States— from its past as the 13 British colonies 
to its growth as an independent country. Slavery fueled its cotton industry 
and made it a leading economic power. 10 of the first 12 presidents
enslaved people. And when US chattel slavery finally ended, it was a long and uneven process. Enslaved people resisted 
from the beginning— by escaping, breaking tools, 
staging rebellions, and more. During the American Revolution, Vermont
and Massachusetts abolished slavery while several states took steps
towards gradual abolition. In 1808, federal law banned the import
of enslaved African people, but it allowed the slave trade
to continue domestically. Approximately 4 million people
were enslaved in the US when Abraham Lincoln was
elected president in 1860. Lincoln opposed slavery, 
and though he had no plans to outlaw it, his election caused panic 
in Southern states, which began withdrawing from the Union. they vowed to uphold slavery
and formed the Confederacy, triggering the start 
of the American Civil War. A year into the conflict, Lincoln
abolished slavery in Washington, D.C., legally freeing more than 3,000 people. And five months later, he announced

**Transcript**:
To survive in this high pressured, crazy world most of us have to become highly adept at self-criticism. We learn how to tell ourselves off for our failures and for not working hard or smart enough. But so good are we at this that we're sometimes in danger of falling prey to an excessive form of self-criticism What we might call self-flagellation a rather dangerous state which just ushers in depression and under-performance. We might simply lose the will to get out of bed. For those moments, we need a corrective. We need to carve out time for an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious. Self-compassion. We're suspicious because that sounds horribly close to self-pity But because depression and self-hatred are serious enemies of a good life, we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life. To this end we can perform what we've called a, "self-compassion exercise" A structured meditation, lasting 15 minutes or so Lying in bed, or perhaps a bath Turn over a sequence of thoughts that interrupt and correct the flow of your worse self-accusations. For a time adopt an entire kindly perspective on your setbacks The self compassion exercise goes like this: We're so in love with success we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we've tried to achieve. We've failed, but given the mountain we were trying to climb, the conclusion doesn't have to be that we're simply flawless. We have tricky family histories, we all do. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain some of our current troubles. We're not entirely sane or well, but none of us are. We weren't well set up to carry out certain tasks It isn't wholly our fault in the here and now. From the media, you'd think everyone was rich and famous and successful. But in reality, undramatic, quiet failure is by a huge margin the statistical norm. We shouldn't tear ourselves apart for not managing to be to what were in truth, awesome odds. Tough, self-critical people don't allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck.

**Transcript**:
To survive in this high pressured, crazy world most of us have to become highly adept at self-criticism. We learn how to tell ourselves off for our failures and for not working hard or smart enough. But so good are we at this that we're sometimes in danger of falling prey to an excessive form of self-criticism What we might call self-flagellation a rather dangerous state which just ushers in depression and under-performance. We might simply lose the will to get out of bed. For those moments, we need a corrective. We need to carve out time for an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious. Self-compassion. We're suspicious because that sounds horribly close to self-pity But because depression and self-hatred are serious enemies of a good life, we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life. To this end we can perform what we've called a, "self-compassion exercise" A structured meditation, lasting 15 minutes or so Lying in bed, or perhaps a bath Turn over a sequence of thoughts that interrupt and correct the flow of your worse self-accusations. For a time adopt an entire kindly perspective on your setbacks The self compassion exercise goes like this: We're so in love with success we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we've tried to achieve. We've failed, but given the mountain we were trying to climb, the conclusion doesn't have to be that we're simply flawless. We have tricky family histories, we all do. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain some of our current troubles. We're not entirely sane or well, but none of us are. We weren't well set up to carry out certain tasks It isn't wholly our fault in the here and now. From the media, you'd think everyone was rich and famous and successful. But in reality, undramatic, quiet failure is by a huge margin the statistical norm. We shouldn't tear ourselves apart for not managing to be to what were in truth, awesome odds. Tough, self-critical people don't allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck. They take responsibility for everything. They think winners make their own luck But they don't for the most part. Luck is a genuine feature of existence We're robbing ourselves of fair concilation By believing that we're entirely in control, and therefore entirely to blame when we crash.

**Transcript**:
LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral
failure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that
any politician's appearance can affect their electability
shouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at
a female politician's face might influence your vote
should give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing
how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics
about another person and how powerful these
judgments are, I think, is something that's
really startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how
powerful a first impression can be just might make you think
twice before you judge a face. For Science Friday,
I'm Luke Groskin.

LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral
failure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that
any politician's appearance can affect their electability
shouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at
a female politician's face might influence your vote
should give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing
how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics
about another person and how powerful these
judgments are, I think, is something that's
really startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how
powerful a first impression can be just might make you think
twice before you judge a face. For Science Friday,

**Transcript**:
LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do
you judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain
extracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are
special in the sense that they provide really
significant information about other people
within 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster
than the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information
from the retina about a face travels back to the
early visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward
through the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be
analyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated
regions of your brain. That you can look at a
face for less than a second and assess gender, race,
age, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's
also interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms
in place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how
we make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI
machine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When
neurons in a brain region start to activate more,
oxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,
they'll highlight with colors what
brain regions are involved in a
particular kind of task or correlated with some
kind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,
if you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex
will light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought
to be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you
think the owner of that face may help you or harm
you, another part of your brain known as the
amygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes
fearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating
rapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also
an extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put
subjects into the scanner and then present faces that
vary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what
33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even
know it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within
those 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it
hit early visual cortex and started feeding forward
and was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the
part of the brain that helps you to
actually consciously see that face, the fusiform
cortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests
that the brain can process the trustworthiness
of a face without even perceptual awareness, so without
even being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact
neurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face
before we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is
inclined to believe that our rapidly responsive
amygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an
emotionally neutral face, we see a subtle
resemblance to an emotion and then run with
that hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of
these personality judgments that we make quite
spontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And
trustworthiness isn't the only type
of snap judgment that can be altered
by tiny facial cues. It happens with
gender perception too. Using software that
tracks the computer mouse movements of people
asked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine
how we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,
if we take a standard male face and make it very slightly
feminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is
that even though they ultimately select male response,
they will be partially, simultaneously
attracted to select female response on the
opposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve
towards the female-gendered response represents the
subjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts
a few milliseconds, it can have real
world consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was
we presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real
politicians' faces. And what we showed
was that that kind of slight swinging towards a
male response before hitting female was
significantly predictive of her electoral
failure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that
any politician's appearance can affect their electability
shouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at
a female politician's face might influence your vote
should give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing
how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics
about another person and how powerful these
judgments are, I think, is something that's
really startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how
powerful a first impression can be just might make you think
twice before you judge a face. For Science Friday,

how subtle the cues are that we use to infer so
many important, meaningful characteristics
about another person and how powerful these
judgments are, I think, is something that's
really startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how
powerful a first impression can be just might make you think
twice before you judge a face. For Science Friday,
I'm Luke Groskin.

**Transcript**:
A canvas drenched in sunset hues,
colors radiating like flame. At first glance, this painting may appear 
to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals 
the tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture 
of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects
into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work 
of Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter 
and sculptor. But the magic behind 
this transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent
her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago 
to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her 
to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude 
and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little 
personal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was 
increasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors 
of Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher 
whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students
to focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s
first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present 
a series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching,
any specific natural reference. Earlier European painters 
in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry
to abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed 
the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these 
would soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement 
called American Modernism. Although no single style defines 
Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire 
to challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, 
Modernist painting often used geometric shapes 
and bold colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself 
into these experiments — but she was reluctant 
to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals
to the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged 
for a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s
career as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead 
to marriage in 1924. Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s
taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint 
for months at a time. Whether she was exploring 
the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, 
or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on 
ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention 
to small details, and spent hours mixing paints 
to create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue,
she’d record it in her ever-growing collection
of handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented 
with perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In "Rams Head with Hollyhock," she places a weathered skull 
and a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows 
the landscape, casting both the skeleton 
and the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was captivated by her 
unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised 
for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies 
to ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time 
were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings
to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed 
such interpretations. She resented the male gaze 
that dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation 
of the natural world. Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down 
in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s
mysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating 
until her death at 98, and is remembered as 
the “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains 
its wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique.

**Transcript**:
A canvas drenched in sunset hues,
colors radiating like flame. At first glance, this painting may appear 
to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals 
the tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture 
of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects
into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work 
of Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter 
and sculptor. But the magic behind 
this transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent
her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago 
to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her 
to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude 
and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little 
personal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was 
increasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors 
of Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher 
whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students
to focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s
first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present 
a series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching,
any specific natural reference. Earlier European painters 
in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry
to abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed 
the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these 
would soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement 
called American Modernism. Although no single style defines 
Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire 
to challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, 
Modernist painting often used geometric shapes 
and bold colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself 
into these experiments — but she was reluctant 
to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals
to the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged 
for a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s
career as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead 
to marriage in 1924. Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s
taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint 
for months at a time. Whether she was exploring 
the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, 
or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on 
ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention 
to small details, and spent hours mixing paints 
to create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue,
she’d record it in her ever-growing collection
of handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented 
with perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In "Rams Head with Hollyhock," she places a weathered skull 
and a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows 
the landscape, casting both the skeleton 
and the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was captivated by her 
unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised 
for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies 
to ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time 
were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings
to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed 
such interpretations. She resented the male gaze 
that dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation 
of the natural world. Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down 
in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s
mysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating 
until her death at 98, and is remembered as 
the “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains 
its wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique.

**Transcript**:
Over the course of the 1960s, the FBI amassed almost 
two thousand documents in an investigation into one 
of America’s most celebrated minds. The subject of this inquiry 
was a writer named James Baldwin. At the time, the FBI investigated many 
artists and thinkers, but most of their files were a 
fraction the size of Baldwin’s. During the years when the FBI hounded him, he became one of the best-selling
black authors in the world. So what made James Baldwin loom 
so large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities? Born in Harlem in 1924, he was the oldest of nine children. At age fourteen,
he began to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons,
he developed his voice as a writer, but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him 
away from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life. Constantly confronted with racism 
and homophobia, he was angry and disillusioned, 
and yearned for a less restricted life. So in 1948, 
at the age of 24, he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship. From France, he published his first novel, "Go Tell it on the Mountain," in 1953. Set in Harlem, the book explores the Church 
as a source of both repression and hope. It was popular with both black 
and white readers. As he earned acclaim for his fiction, Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, 
class, culture and exile in his 1955 extended essay, 
"Notes of a Native Son." Meanwhile, the Civil Rights movement 
was gaining momentum in America. Black Americans were making incremental 
gains at registering to vote and voting, but were still denied basic dignities in 
schools, on buses, in the work force, and in the armed services. Though he lived primarily in France 
for the rest of his life, Baldwin was deeply invested in 
the movement, and keenly aware of his 
country’s unfulfilled promise. He had seen family, friends, 
and neighbors spiral into addiction, incarceration
and suicide. He believed their fates originated 
from the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published "The Fire Next Time," an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America 
accountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed 
in the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history 
and history is trapped in them.” Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights 
movement went beyond observing and reporting. He also traveled through the 
American South attending rallies giving lectures 
of his own. He debated both white politicians 
and black activists, including Malcolm X, and served as a liaison between black 
activists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders 
like Robert Kennedy. Because of Baldwin’s unique ability to articulate the causes 
of social turbulence in a way that white audiences 
were willing to hear, Kennedy and others tended to see 
him as an ambassador for black Americans — a label Baldwin rejected. And at the same time, his faculty with words led the 
FBI to view him as a threat. Even within the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin could sometimes feel 
like an outsider for his choice to live abroad,
as well as his sexuality, which he explored openly 
in his writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant. Throughout his life, Baldwin considered it his role
to bear witness. Unlike many of his peers, he lived to see some of the
victories of the Civil Rights movement, but the continuing racial inequalities in 
the United States weighed heavily on him. Though he may have felt trapped 
in his moment in history, his words have made generations 
of people feel known, while guiding them toward a more 
nuanced understanding of society’s most complex issues.

from the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published "The Fire Next Time," an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America 
accountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed 
in the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history 
and history is trapped in them.” Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights 
movement went beyond observing and reporting. He also traveled through the 
American South attending rallies giving lectures 
of his own. He debated both white politicians 
and black activists, including Malcolm X, and served as a liaison between black 
activists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders 
like Robert Kennedy. Because of Baldwin’s unique ability to articulate the causes 
of social turbulence in a way that white audiences 
were willing to hear, Kennedy and others tended to see 
him as an ambassador for black Americans — a label Baldwin rejected. And at the same time, his faculty with words led the 
FBI to view him as a threat. Even within the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin could sometimes feel 
like an outsider for his choice to live abroad,
as well as his sexuality, which he explored openly 
in his writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant. Throughout his life, Baldwin considered it his role
to bear witness. Unlike many of his peers, he lived to see some of the
victories of the Civil Rights movement, but the continuing racial inequalities in 
the United States weighed heavily on him. Though he may have felt trapped 
in his moment in history, his words have made generations 
of people feel known, while guiding them toward a more 
nuanced understanding of society’s most complex issues.

**Transcript**:
Over the course of the 1960s, the FBI amassed almost 
two thousand documents in an investigation into one 
of America’s most celebrated minds. The subject of this inquiry 
was a writer named James Baldwin. At the time, the FBI investigated many 
artists and thinkers, but most of their files were a 
fraction the size of Baldwin’s. During the years when the FBI hounded him, he became one of the best-selling
black authors in the world. So what made James Baldwin loom 
so large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities? Born in Harlem in 1924, he was the oldest of nine children. At age fourteen,
he began to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons,
he developed his voice as a writer, but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him 
away from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life. Constantly confronted with racism 
and homophobia, he was angry and disillusioned, 
and yearned for a less restricted life. So in 1948, 
at the age of 24, he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship. From France, he published his first novel, "Go Tell it on the Mountain," in 1953. Set in Harlem, the book explores the Church 
as a source of both repression and hope. It was popular with both black 
and white readers. As he earned acclaim for his fiction, Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, 
class, culture and exile in his 1955 extended essay, 
"Notes of a Native Son." Meanwhile, the Civil Rights movement 
was gaining momentum in America. Black Americans were making incremental 
gains at registering to vote and voting, but were still denied basic dignities in 
schools, on buses, in the work force, and in the armed services. Though he lived primarily in France 
for the rest of his life, Baldwin was deeply invested in 
the movement, and keenly aware of his 
country’s unfulfilled promise. He had seen family, friends, 
and neighbors spiral into addiction, incarceration
and suicide. He believed their fates originated 
from the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published "The Fire Next Time," an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America 
accountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed 
in the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history

**Transcript**:
Love is often described as heartwarming,
heart-wrenching and even heartbreaking. So, what does the brain have
to do with it? Everything! The journey from first spark to last tear
is guided by a symphony of neurochemicals and brain systems. As you begin to fall for someone, you may find yourself excessively
daydreaming about them and wanting to spend more and more
time together. This first stage of love is what
psychologists call infatuation, or passionate love. Your new relationship
can feel almost intoxicating, and when it comes to the brain,
that’s not far from the truth. Infatuated individuals show increased
activation in the ventral tegmental area. The VTA is the reward-processing 
and motivation hub of the brain, firing when you do things like 
eat a sweet treat, quench your thirst, or in more extreme cases,
take drugs of abuse. Activation releases the “feel good”
neurotransmitter dopamine, teaching your brain to repeat behaviors 
in anticipation of receiving the same initial reward. This increased VTA activity is the
reason love's not only euphoric, but also draws you towards
your new partner. At this first stage, it may be hard to see
any faults in your new perfect partner. This haze is thanks
to love’s influence on higher cortical brain regions. Some newly infatuated individuals
show decreased activity in the brain’s cognitive center, 
the prefrontal cortex. As activation of this region allows us 
to engage in critical thought and pass judgment, it’s not surprising we tend to see 
new relationships through rose-colored glasses. While this first stage of love can be an intense rollercoaster of emotions
and brain activity, it typically only lasts a few months, making way for the more long-lasting
stage of love, known as attachment,
or compassionate love. As your relationship develops, you may feel more relaxed 
and committed to your partner thanks in large part to two hormones:
oxytocin and vasopressin. Known as pair-bonding hormones, they signal trust, 
feelings of social support and attachment. In this way, romantic love 
is not unlike other forms of love, as these hormones also help bond
families and friendships. Further, oxytocin can inhibit 
the release of stress hormones, which is why spending time 
with a loved one can feel so relaxing. As early love's suspension
of judgment fades, it can be replaced by a more honest
understanding and deeper connection. Alternatively, as your rose-colored
glasses begin to lose their tint, problems in your relationship
may become more evident. No matter the reason 
a relationship ends, we can blame the pain that accompanies
heartbreak on the brain. The distress of a breakup activates
the insular cortex, a region that processes pain— both physical, 
like spraining your ankle, as well as social, 
like the feelings of rejection. As days pass, you may find yourself
once again daydreaming about or craving contact with your lost partner. The drive to reach out may
feel overwhelming, like an extreme hunger or thirst. When looking at photos
of a former partner, heartbroken individuals again show
increased activity in the VTA, the motivation and reward center 
that drove feelings of longing during the initial stages 
of the relationship. This emotional whirlwind also likely
activates your body’s alarm system, the stress axis, leaving you feeling 
shaken and restless. As time goes on, higher cortical regions which oversee 
reasoning and impulse control, can pump the brakes on this distress
and craving signaling. Given that these regions
are still maturing and making connections
through adolescence, it's no wonder that first heartbreak
can feel particularly agonizing. Activities like exercise, 
spending time with friends, or even listening to your favorite song can tame this heartbreak stress response, while also triggering the release 
of feel good neurotransmitter dopamine. And given time and the support, most can heal and learn from even
the most devastating heartbreak.

Options: A. Increase , B. Decrease
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why might someone who is newly infatuated tend to see their partner as perfect and flawless?
Options: A. Increased activity in the prefrontal cortex leads to more critical thinking, B. Decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex leads to less critical thinking, C. Increased activity in the VTA releases dopamine, associating the partner with pleasure, D. Increased activity in the insular cortex enhances emotional awareness
Correct Option: B

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is closely related to the ground truth question, as both deal with the infatuation stage of love and the prefrontal cortex. However, the generated question is more specific and focused on the consequences of decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 1.0000 (The correct answer option in the generated question matches the ground truth answer, as both indicate a decrease in activity in the prefrontal cortex.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.8000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible but not perfect. Option A is a good distractor, as it presents the opposite of the correct answer. Option C is related to the topic but not directly relevant to the question. Option D is less plausible, as the insular cortex is not directly related to the infatuation stage.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (The generated question and options are clear and understandable, but the question is slightly more complex than the ground truth question.)

**Transcript**:
Love is often described as heartwarming,
heart-wrenching and even heartbreaking. So, what does the brain have
to do with it? Everything! The journey from first spark to last tear
is guided by a symphony of neurochemicals and brain systems. As you begin to fall for someone, you may find yourself excessively
daydreaming about them and wanting to spend more and more
time together. This first stage of love is what
psychologists call infatuation, or passionate love. Your new relationship
can feel almost intoxicating, and when it comes to the brain,
that’s not far from the truth. Infatuated individuals show increased
activation in the ventral tegmental area. The VTA is the reward-processing 
and motivation hub of the brain, firing when you do things like 
eat a sweet treat, quench your thirst, or in more extreme cases,
take drugs of abuse. Activation releases the “feel good”
neurotransmitter dopamine, teaching your brain to repeat behaviors 
in anticipation of receiving the same initial reward. This increased VTA activity is the
reason love's not only euphoric, but also draws you towards
your new partner. At this first stage, it may be hard to see
any faults in your new perfect partner. This haze is thanks
to love’s influence on higher cortical brain regions. Some newly infatuated individuals
show decreased activity in the brain’s cognitive center, 
the prefrontal cortex. As activation of this region allows us 
to engage in critical thought and pass judgment, it’s not surprising we tend to see 
new relationships through rose-colored glasses. While this first stage of love can be an intense rollercoaster of emotions
and brain activity, it typically only lasts a few months, making way for the more long-lasting
stage of love, known as attachment,
or compassionate love. As your relationship develops, you may feel more relaxed 
and committed to your partner thanks in large part to two hormones:
oxytocin and vasopressin. Known as pair-bonding hormones, they signal trust, 
feelings of social support and attachment. In this way, romantic love 
is not unlike other forms of love, as these hormones also help bond
families and friendships. Further, oxytocin can inhibit 
the release of stress hormones, which is why spending time 
with a loved one can feel so relaxing. As early love's suspension
of judgment fades, it can be replaced by a more honest
understanding and deeper connection. Alternatively, as your rose-colored
glasses begin to lose their tint, problems in your relationship
may become more evident. No matter the reason 
a relationship ends, we can blame the pain that accompanies
heartbreak on the brain. The distress of a breakup activates
the insular cortex, a region that processes pain— both physical, 
like spraining your ankle, as well as social, 
like the feelings of rejection. As days pass, you may find yourself
once again daydreaming about or craving contact with your lost partner. The drive to reach out may
feel overwhelming, like an extreme hunger or thirst. When looking at photos
of a former partner, heartbroken individuals again show
increased activity in the VTA, the motivation and reward center 
that drove feelings of longing during the initial stages 
of the relationship. This emotional whirlwind also likely
activates your body’s alarm system, the stress axis, leaving you feeling 
shaken and restless. As time goes on, higher cortical regions which oversee 
reasoning and impulse control, can pump the brakes on this distress
and craving signaling. Given that these regions
are still maturing and making connections
through adolescence, it's no wonder that first heartbreak
can feel particularly agonizing. Activities like exercise, 
spending time with friends, or even listening to your favorite song can tame this heartbreak stress response, while also triggering the release 
of feel good neurotransmitter dopamine. And given time and the support, most can heal and learn from even
the most devastating heartbreak.

**Transcript**:
Following a devastating nuclear war, Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali. These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species’ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other. The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into 
the biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish? Questions like this haunt 
Octavia Butler’s "Dawn," the first in her trilogy "Lilith’s Brood." A visionary storyteller who 
upended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds 
throughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep 
us awake at night. Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in 
Pasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these 
scenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother 
for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction
film called "Devil Girl From Mars." Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story. Much science fiction features 
white male heroes who blast aliens or become 
saviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters
for diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the 
representation of their experiences. For Butler, imagination was not only for planting 
the seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an 
unjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling 
features of the world such as discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate 
them in new contexts. One of her most beloved novels, the "Parable of the Sower," follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future
California, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that 
causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance 
with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an 
ever-changing world. Lauren’s quest had roots 
in a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented
immigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated 
contemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the 
Sower," "Parable of the Talents," she wrote of a presidential candidate who controls Americans with virtual 
reality and “shock collars.” His slogan? “Make America great again.” While people have noted her prescience, Butler was also interested in 
re-examining history. For instance,
"Kindred" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly
pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation 
of her ancestors. Early on, she learns that her mission 
is to save the life of the white man who will rape her great grandmother. If she doesn’t save him, 
she herself will cease to exist. This grim dilemma forces Dana to 
confront the ongoing trauma of slavery and sexual violence 
against Black women. With her stories of women 
founding new societies, time travelers overcoming 
historical strife, and interspecies bonding, Butler had a profound influence on 
the growing popularity of Afrofuturism. That’s a cultural movement where Black writers and artists who are 
inspired by the past, present and future, produce works that incorporate magic, 
history, technology and much more. As Lauren comes to learn in 
"Parable of the Sower," "All that you touch you Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change.”

causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance 
with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an 
ever-changing world. Lauren’s quest had roots 
in a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented
immigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated 
contemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the 
Sower," "Parable of the Talents," she wrote of a presidential candidate who controls Americans with virtual 
reality and “shock collars.” His slogan? “Make America great again.” While people have noted her prescience, Butler was also interested in 
re-examining history. For instance,
"Kindred" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly
pulled back in time to the Maryland plantation 
of her ancestors. Early on, she learns that her mission 
is to save the life of the white man who will rape her great grandmother. If she doesn’t save him, 
she herself will cease to exist. This grim dilemma forces Dana to 
confront the ongoing trauma of slavery and sexual violence 
against Black women. With her stories of women 
founding new societies, time travelers overcoming 
historical strife, and interspecies bonding, Butler had a profound influence on 
the growing popularity of Afrofuturism. That’s a cultural movement where Black writers and artists who are 
inspired by the past, present and future, produce works that incorporate magic, 
history, technology and much more. As Lauren comes to learn in 
"Parable of the Sower," "All that you touch you Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change.”

**Transcript**:
Following a devastating nuclear war, Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali. These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species’ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other. The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into 
the biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish? Questions like this haunt 
Octavia Butler’s "Dawn," the first in her trilogy "Lilith’s Brood." A visionary storyteller who 
upended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds 
throughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep 
us awake at night. Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in 
Pasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these 
scenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother 
for a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction
film called "Devil Girl From Mars." Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story. Much science fiction features 
white male heroes who blast aliens or become 
saviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters
for diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the 
representation of their experiences. For Butler, imagination was not only for planting 
the seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an 
unjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling 
features of the world such as discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate 
them in new contexts. One of her most beloved novels, the "Parable of the Sower," follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future
California, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that 
causes her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance

**Transcript**:
It’s easy to feel like you’re an even
mix of your parents, but that’s not always the case. So, who should you be blaming over those traits
you don’t like? What did you inherit from Mom and what came
from Dad? Colour-blind? If you’re a male, you can thank your mother. Red-green colour blindness is an X-linked
disorder that affects nearly 6% of the male population worldwide, but only 0.4% of females. This is because males only inherit one X chromosome,
which is from their mother, and that’s where red-green colorblindness comes from. If you’re a female, you have to get a the
X-variant from both parents. So that 0.4% can blame dad as well! Balding? A big component comes from the X-chromosome
here too, so you likely inherited this from your mom. However, a study involving 52,000 people found
that genes on other chromosomes can affect this condition, on top of environmental factors
such as age, stress, and diet - so mom isn’t entirely to blame! Research has also found that the shape of
the end of your nose, the area above and below the lips, cheekbones and the inner corner
of the eye are highly influenced by genetics. And interestingly, the more they resemble
your father as a child, the healthier you’re likely to be. Why? Scientists believe that a father-child resemblance
causes fathers to spend more time engaging in positive parenting, which ultimately contributes
to healthier kids. Now, even though you get half of your 46 chromosomes
from mom and the other from dad, a study involving genetically diverse mice found that for 60%
of genes the paternal copy was more active than the maternal copy. This phenomenon is known as allelic imbalance. The same study also noted that the brains
of these particular mice more closely resembled that of their dad than their mom. However, in humans we actually see the opposite. Our brains are more similar to our mother,
which is particularly true for daughters. Interestingly, the similar brain regions are
actually associated with depressive conditions, suggesting that mood disorders may pass from
mother to daughter. Biologists used to believe that all DNA came
from the nucleus, but we now know that the mitochondria (AKA the powerhouse of the cell)
also kicks in some protein coding genes. And this mitochondrial DNA is specifically
inherited from your mom because your dad’s degraded immediately after fertilization. Considering how important mitochondrial DNA
is in the cell, there is a stronger maternal link. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been associated
with Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease - which more likely came from your mom. Maternal inheritance gave rise to the idea
of a “Mitochondrial Eve”, a woman who lived between 180,000 to 580,000 years ago
from which all human mitochondrial DNA is rooted. At the end of the day, it may seem like a
lot of traits actually come from your mom, or at least, from the X chromosome - and that’s
generally true, genetically. The Y-chromosome is very small, and doesn’t
contain as many genes; and both females and males contain X-chromosomes, which carry more
genes. But as we continue to research more about
ourselves at the genetic level, the division between what you got from mom vs. dad may
become even more pronounced. If you want to know more about your own genetics,
you can visit 23andMe.com/asap, who sponsored this episode. Whether you want to know about your chances
of balding, back hair, your taste sense or where your ancestors came from, 23andMe’s
kit will get you started. We both took it, and I found out the GREAT
news that I’m more prone to having a little upper back hair, which until recently I thought
was FALSE, but as I’ve aged Greg told me is actually TRUE!! What I thought was cool is that you can find

when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

**Transcript**:
when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you

**Transcript**:
when I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these

**Transcript**:
What if William Shakespeare had a sister
who matched his imagination, his wit, and his way with words? Would she have gone to school
and set the stage alight? In her essay "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf argues that this would
have been impossible. She concocts a fictional sister
who's stuck at home, snatching time to scribble a few pages before she finds herself
betrothed and runs away. While her brother finds fame and fortune,
she remains abandoned and anonymous. In this thought experiment, Woolf demonstrates the tragedy
of genius restricted, and looks back through time for hints
of these hidden histories. She wrote, "When one reads 
of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man
who had a mother, then I think we're on the track
of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen." "A Room of One's Own" considers a world
denied great works of art due to exclusion and inequality. How best can we understand
the internal experience of alienation? In both her essays and fiction, Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature 
of subjective experience into words. Her characters frequently lead inner lives
that are deeply at odds with their external existence. To help make sense of these disparities,
the next time you read Woolf, here are some aspects of her life
and work to consider. She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen
in 1882 to a large and wealthy family, which enabled her to pursue a life
in the arts. The death of her mother in 1895
was followed by that of her half-sister, father, and brother 
within the next ten years. These losses led to Woolf's first
depressive episode and subsequent institutionalization. As a young woman, she purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area 
of London with her siblings. This brought her into contact
with a circle of creatives, including E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, and Leonard Woolf. These friends became known
as the Bloomsbury Group, and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912. The members of this group were prominent
figures in Modernism, a cultural movement that sought
to push the boundaries of how reality is represented. Key features of Modernist writing include
the use of stream of consciousness, interior monologue, distortions in time, and multiple or shifting perspectives. These appear in the work of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Woolf herself. While reading Joyce's "Ulysses,"
Woolf began writing "Mrs. Dalloway." Like "Ulysses," the text takes place
over the course of a single day and opens under seemingly
mundane circumstances. "Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself." But the novel dives deeply
into the characters' traumatic pasts, weaving the inner world of numbed
socialite Clarissa Dalloway, with that of the shell-shocked veteran
Septimus Warren Smith. Woolf uses interior monologue
to contrast the rich world of the mind against her characters' 
external existences. In her novel "To the Lighthouse," mundane moments, like a dinner party,
or losing a necklace trigger psychological revelations
in the lives of the Ramsay's, a fictionalized version 
of Woolf's family growing up. "To the Lighthouse" also contains
one of the most famous examples of Woolf's radical representation of time. In the Time Passes section, ten years are distilled 
into about 20 pages. Here, the lack of human presence
in the Ramsays' beach house allows Woolf to reimagine time
in flashes and fragments of prose. "The house was left. 
The house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sand hill
to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it." In her novel "The Waves," there is little distinction between
the narratives of the six main characters. Woolf experiments 
with collective consciousness, at times collapsing the six voices
into one. "It is not one life that I look back upon: I am not one person: 
I am many people: I do not altogether know who I am, Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis, or how to distinguish 
my life from their's." In "The Waves," six become one,
but in the gender-bending "Orlando," a single character 
inhabits multiple identities. The protagonist is a poet who switches
between genders and lives for 300 years. With its fluid language 
and approach to identity, "Orlando" is considered 
a key text in gender studies. The mind can only fly 
so far from the body before it returns 
to the constraints of life. Like many of her characters,
Woolf's life ended in tragedy when she drowned herself at the age of 59. Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering. Through deep thought,
Woolf's characters are shown to temporarily transcend 
their material reality, and in its careful consideration
of the complexity of the mind, her work charts the importance of making
our inner lives known to each other.

**Transcript**:
What if William Shakespeare had a sister
who matched his imagination, his wit, and his way with words? Would she have gone to school
and set the stage alight? In her essay "A Room of One's Own," Virginia Woolf argues that this would
have been impossible. She concocts a fictional sister
who's stuck at home, snatching time to scribble a few pages before she finds herself
betrothed and runs away. While her brother finds fame and fortune,
she remains abandoned and anonymous. In this thought experiment, Woolf demonstrates the tragedy
of genius restricted, and looks back through time for hints
of these hidden histories. She wrote, "When one reads 
of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man
who had a mother, then I think we're on the track
of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen." "A Room of One's Own" considers a world
denied great works of art due to exclusion and inequality. How best can we understand
the internal experience of alienation? In both her essays and fiction, Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature 
of subjective experience into words. Her characters frequently lead inner lives
that are deeply at odds with their external existence. To help make sense of these disparities,
the next time you read Woolf, here are some aspects of her life
and work to consider. She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen
in 1882 to a large and wealthy family, which enabled her to pursue a life
in the arts. The death of her mother in 1895
was followed by that of her half-sister, father, and brother 
within the next ten years. These losses led to Woolf's first
depressive episode and subsequent institutionalization. As a young woman, she purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area 
of London with her siblings. This brought her into contact
with a circle of creatives, including E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, and Leonard Woolf. These friends became known
as the Bloomsbury Group, and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912. The members of this group were prominent
figures in Modernism, a cultural movement that sought
to push the boundaries of how reality is represented. Key features of Modernist writing include
the use of stream of consciousness, interior monologue, distortions in time, and multiple or shifting perspectives. These appear in the work of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Woolf herself. While reading Joyce's "Ulysses,"
Woolf began writing "Mrs. Dalloway." Like "Ulysses," the text takes place
over the course of a single day and opens under seemingly
mundane circumstances. "Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself." But the novel dives deeply
into the characters' traumatic pasts, weaving the inner world of numbed
socialite Clarissa Dalloway, with that of the shell-shocked veteran
Septimus Warren Smith. Woolf uses interior monologue
to contrast the rich world of the mind against her characters' 
external existences. In her novel "To the Lighthouse," mundane moments, like a dinner party,
or losing a necklace trigger psychological revelations
in the lives of the Ramsay's, a fictionalized version 
of Woolf's family growing up. "To the Lighthouse" also contains
one of the most famous examples of Woolf's radical representation of time. In the Time Passes section, ten years are distilled 
into about 20 pages. Here, the lack of human presence
in the Ramsays' beach house allows Woolf to reimagine time
in flashes and fragments of prose. "The house was left. 
The house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sand hill
to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it." In her novel "The Waves," there is little distinction between
the narratives of the six main characters. Woolf experiments 
with collective consciousness, at times collapsing the six voices
into one. "It is not one life that I look back upon: I am not one person: 
I am many people: I do not altogether know who I am, Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis, or how to distinguish 
my life from their's." In "The Waves," six become one,
but in the gender-bending "Orlando," a single character 
inhabits multiple identities. The protagonist is a poet who switches
between genders and lives for 300 years. With its fluid language 
and approach to identity, "Orlando" is considered 
a key text in gender studies. The mind can only fly 
so far from the body before it returns 
to the constraints of life. Like many of her characters,
Woolf's life ended in tragedy when she drowned herself at the age of 59. Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering. Through deep thought,
Woolf's characters are shown to temporarily transcend 
their material reality, and in its careful consideration
of the complexity of the mind, her work charts the importance of making
our inner lives known to each other.

**Transcript**:
         When I was a kid, I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing. I thought they were both pork chops. And because my grandmother thought it was cute   and because they were my favourite she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. One day, before I realized fat kids are not 
designed to climb trees I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body I didn't want to tell my grandmother about it because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere that I shouldn't have been. A few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise and I got sent to the principal's office. From there I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home. I saw no reason to lie. As far as I was concerned life was pretty good I told her, "Whenever I'm sad my grandmother gives me karate chops." This led to a full scale investigation and I was removed from the house for three days... until they finally decided to ask 
how I got the bruises. News of this silly little story quickly spread
through the school and I earned my first nickname: Pork Chop. To this day... I hate pork chops. I'm not the only kid who grew up this way. Surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme... about sticks and stones As if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called, and we got called them all. So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us. That we'd be lonely forever. That we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool shed. So broken heart strings bled the blues as we tried to empty ourselves so we would feel nothing. Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone. That an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away That there's no way for it to metastasize It does. She was eight years old... Our first day of grade three when she got called "ugly." We both got moved to the back of the class so we would stop getting bombarded by spit balls But the school halls were a battleground where we found ourselves outnumbered
day after wretched day. We used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse. Outside we'd have to rehearse running away   or learn to stay still like statues giving
no clues that we were there. In grade five they taped a sign to her desk that read "Beware of Dog." To this day, despite a loving husband, She doesn't think she's beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half of her face. Kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase but couldn't quite get the job done. And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word "Mom." Because they see her heart before they see her skin. That she's only ever always been amazing. He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree. Adopted but not because his parents opted
for a different destiny. He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy. Started therapy in 8th grade. Had a personality made up of tests and pills. Lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs. Four fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of anti-depressants, and an adolescence of being called "Popper." One part because of the pills and ninety nine parts because of the cruelty. He tried to kill himself in grade ten when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him "get over it."  As if depression is something 
that can be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit. To this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends, could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moments before it's about to fall and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration, he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes becoming drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity. We weren't the only kids who grew up this way. To this day kids are still being called names. The classics were "Hey stupid" "Hey spaz" Seems like each school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear do they make a sound? Are they just the background noise of a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like "kids can be cruel"? Every school was a big top circus tent and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers, from clowns to carnies. All of these were miles ahead of who we were. We were freaks. Lobster claw boys and bearded ladies Oddities Juggling depression and loneliness, 
playing Solitaire, spin the bottle, Trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal. But at night, while the others slept We kept walking the tightrope. It was practice and yeah, some of us fell. But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris, leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be.   And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror. Look a little closer. Stare a little longer. Because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit. You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself. You signed it, "they were wrong." Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or clique. Maybe they decided to pick you last
for basketball or everything. Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it? You have to believe that they were wrong They have to be wrong.
Why else would we still be here? We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them. We stem from a root planted in the belief That we are not what we were called We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting
empty on a highway. And if in some way we are, don't worry. We only got out to walk and get gas. We are graduating members from the class of "we made it." Not the faded echoes of voices crying out "names will never hurt me." Of course, they did.
But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain... and more to do with beauty.

**Transcript**:
Adjusting her disguise, Zhu Yingtai 
prepared to bid her parents goodbye. She had always been a dutiful daughter—
staying home and creating works of embroidery
that brought her parents pride. And yet, although only boys were allowed
at the Confucius Academy in Hangzhou, what Yingtai truly wanted
was to go to school. She begged her parents 
to let her attend dressed as a boy and, seeing her determination 
and clever disguises, they finally agreed. However, they only gave her permission
when she promised to keep her true identity a secret and eventually return to the traditional
path they’d set for her. Elated, Yingtai began her journey
to Hangzhou. On the way, she found herself 
at a crossroads, unsure which route to take
when a young man approached. As their eyes met, 
they shared an instant connection. Yingtai learned that his name was 
Liang Shanbo, and that he’d be her classmate
at the academy, so they walked the rest 
of the way together, rapt in conversation. Yingtai realized that, 
despite her meticulous disguise, she felt that she could
finally be herself. The two decided to celebrate 
what they thought would be a long, close friendship, 
and became sworn brothers. At the academy, 
Yingtai buried herself in books and studied with Shanbo 
late into the nights. The two felt at home so long as they were
at each other’s sides. They shared a room, but even though
Shanbo questioned her about it, Yingtai always used the bathroom alone and buttoned her thick robes 
up to her chin— no matter the weather. Now and again, Yingtai heard students
muttering about her secretive behavior. As months slipped into years,
Yingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past—
and intended future—were lifetimes away. Yet the whispers grew louder. And after three years,
she had no choice but to leave. Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo
to visit her. When Yingtai returned home, her parents announced that the Ma family
from the neighboring village had sent a matchmaker 
to ask their permission for Yingtai to marry their son. They’d found it a fitting match
and accepted. Trying to hide her disappointment, 
Yingtai honored their agreement. But as she prepared for another new life,
she thought of Shanbo. Meanwhile, he too was distracted—
his studies dull without Yingtai near. When Shanbo finally visited 
Yingtai’s house, he came upon a young woman. He was about to ask for her brother, but as their eyes met, he recognized 
the young scholar he’d always loved. Shanbo knew he couldn’t stand
being separated from Yingtai again and asked her to marry him. But, heartbroken, Yingtai told him 
that she was already promised to another. Shanbo was devastated, but he understood
that Yingtai had to abide by her parents’ wishes, 
and they parted again. Shanbo fell ill and grew weaker
by the day. Worried, his family sent a matchmaker
to the Zhu family. But, because of Yingtai’s 
current engagement, her father refused the proposal. Doing otherwise would bring their family
public shame. Shanbo’s Illness took a turn for the worse and, sensing he wouldn’t live
to see her married, Shanbo wrote Yingtai a final letter. If Yingtai loved him,
he asked that she burn incense in front of his tomb 
when she was on her way to the Ma family. When Yingtai’s wedding day came,
it also felt like a funeral. As the procession wound through town
under stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt
in front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices
through her tears. Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded above and a lightning bolt shot 
through the tomb, fracturing the stone. Without hesitation, 
Yingtai threw herself in. As her parents rushed 
to rescue their daughter, two butterflies fluttered 
out of the crack. This time, Yingtai had transformed 
for good. Finally free, she could float forever 
with Shanbo at her side.

**Transcript**:
Adjusting her disguise, Zhu Yingtai 
prepared to bid her parents goodbye. She had always been a dutiful daughter—
staying home and creating works of embroidery
that brought her parents pride. And yet, although only boys were allowed
at the Confucius Academy in Hangzhou, what Yingtai truly wanted
was to go to school. She begged her parents 
to let her attend dressed as a boy and, seeing her determination 
and clever disguises, they finally agreed. However, they only gave her permission
when she promised to keep her true identity a secret and eventually return to the traditional
path they’d set for her. Elated, Yingtai began her journey
to Hangzhou. On the way, she found herself 
at a crossroads, unsure which route to take
when a young man approached. As their eyes met, 
they shared an instant connection. Yingtai learned that his name was 
Liang Shanbo, and that he’d be her classmate
at the academy, so they walked the rest 
of the way together, rapt in conversation. Yingtai realized that, 
despite her meticulous disguise, she felt that she could
finally be herself. The two decided to celebrate 
what they thought would be a long, close friendship, 
and became sworn brothers. At the academy, 
Yingtai buried herself in books and studied with Shanbo 
late into the nights. The two felt at home so long as they were
at each other’s sides. They shared a room, but even though
Shanbo questioned her about it, Yingtai always used the bathroom alone and buttoned her thick robes 
up to her chin— no matter the weather. Now and again, Yingtai heard students
muttering about her secretive behavior. As months slipped into years,
Yingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past—
and intended future—were lifetimes away. Yet the whispers grew louder. And after three years,
she had no choice but to leave. Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo
to visit her. When Yingtai returned home, her parents announced that the Ma family
from the neighboring village had sent a matchmaker 
to ask their permission for Yingtai to marry their son. They’d found it a fitting match
and accepted. Trying to hide her disappointment, 
Yingtai honored their agreement. But as she prepared for another new life,
she thought of Shanbo. Meanwhile, he too was distracted—
his studies dull without Yingtai near. When Shanbo finally visited 
Yingtai’s house, he came upon a young woman. He was about to ask for her brother, but as their eyes met, he recognized 
the young scholar he’d always loved. Shanbo knew he couldn’t stand
being separated from Yingtai again and asked her to marry him. But, heartbroken, Yingtai told him 
that she was already promised to another. Shanbo was devastated, but he understood
that Yingtai had to abide by her parents’ wishes, 
and they parted again. Shanbo fell ill and grew weaker
by the day. Worried, his family sent a matchmaker
to the Zhu family. But, because of Yingtai’s 
current engagement, her father refused the proposal. Doing otherwise would bring their family
public shame. Shanbo’s Illness took a turn for the worse and, sensing he wouldn’t live
to see her married, Shanbo wrote Yingtai a final letter. If Yingtai loved him,
he asked that she burn incense in front of his tomb 
when she was on her way to the Ma family. When Yingtai’s wedding day came,
it also felt like a funeral. As the procession wound through town
under stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt
in front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices
through her tears. Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded above and a lightning bolt shot 
through the tomb, fracturing the stone. Without hesitation, 
Yingtai threw herself in. As her parents rushed 
to rescue their daughter, two butterflies fluttered 
out of the crack. This time, Yingtai had transformed 
for good. Finally free, she could float forever 
with Shanbo at her side.

**Transcript**:
On August 28th, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom. That day, nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence, and economic exclusion 
black people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated 
facilities from within. Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people who could help further 
messages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights 
were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the 
party’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the 
peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies 
for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before. His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963, when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality. Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march he delivered the
marchers' demands in a speech directed at 
President John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly,
without any violence. It has been credited with helping pass 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places 
and banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory 
voting practices. In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political 
issues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough 
of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate
with the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his 
former communist affiliation. But ultimately, both his belief
in collaboration with the government 
and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire
to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible. Rustin was passed over for several 
influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay,
and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis
until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously 
awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s 
“march towards true equality, no matter who we are 
or who we love.”

**Transcript**:
On August 28th, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom. That day, nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence, and economic exclusion 
black people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school. He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated 
facilities from within. Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people who could help further 
messages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights 
were one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the 
party’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the 
peaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies 
for peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before. His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963, when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality. Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march he delivered the
marchers' demands in a speech directed at 
President John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly,
without any violence. It has been credited with helping pass 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places 
and banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory 
voting practices. In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political 
issues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough 
of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate
with the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his 
former communist affiliation. But ultimately, both his belief
in collaboration with the government 
and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire
to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible. Rustin was passed over for several 
influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism. In the 1980s, he publicly came out as gay,
and was instrumental in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis
until his death in 1987. In 2013, fifty years after the March On Washington, President Barack Obama posthumously 
awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, praising Rustin’s 
“march towards true equality, no matter who we are 
or who we love.”
