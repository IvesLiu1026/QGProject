**Transcript**:
Denis Diderot left a dungeon
outside Paris on November 3, 1749. He'd had his writing 
burned in public before, but this time, he'd gotten locked up
under royal order for an essay about a philosopher's
death bed rejection of God. To free himself, Denis promised
never to write things like that again. So he got back to work 
on something a little like that, only way worse, and much bigger. In 1745, publisher André le Breton
had hired Diderot to adapt the English cyclopedia, or a universal dictionary 
of arts and sciences for French subscribers. A broke writer, Diderot survived
by translating, tutoring, and authoring sermons for priests, and a pornographic novel once. Le Breton paired him with co-editor
Jean le Rond d'Alembert, a math genius found 
on a church doorstep as a baby. Technical dictionaries, 
like the cyclopedia, weren't new, but no one had attempted one publication
covering all knowledge, so they did. The two men organized 
the French Enlightenment's brightest stars to produce the first encyclopedia, or rational dictionary of the arts,
sciences, and crafts. Assembling every essential fact
and principle in, as it turned out, over 70,000 entries, 20,000,000 words in 35 volumes of text and illustrations created over three decades
of researching, writing, arguging, smuggling, backstabbing, law-breaking, and alphabetizing. To organize the work, Diderot adapted Francis Bacon's
"Classification of Knowledge" into a three-part system based 
on the mind's approaches to reality: memory, reason, and imagination. He also emphasized the importance
of commerce, technology, and crafts, poking around shops to study the tools
and techniques of Parisian laborers. To spotlight a few of the nearly
150 philosoph contributers, Jean Jacques Rousseau,
Diderot's close friend, wrote much of the music section 
in three months, and was never reimbursed for copy fees. His entry on political economy holds ideas
he'd later develop further in "The Social Contract." D'Alembert wrote 
the famous preliminary discourse, a key statement 
of the French Enlightenment, championing independent 
investigative reasoning as the path to progress. Louis de Jaucourt wrote a quarter
of the encyclopedia, 18,000 articles, 5,000,000 words, unpaid. Louis once spent 20 years writing a book
on anatomy, shipped it to Amsterdam 
to be published uncensored, and the ship sank. Voltaire contributed entries, among them history, elegance, and fire. Diderot's entries sometimes 
exhibit slight bias. In "political authority," he dismantled
the divine right of kings. Under "citizen," he argued a state was strongest 
without great disparity in wealth. Not surprising from the guy who wrote
poetry about mankind strangling its kings with the entrails of a priest. So Diderot's masterpiece wasn't a hit
with the king or highest priest. Upon release of the first two volumes, Louie XV banned the whole thing
but enjoyed his own copy. Pope Clement XIII ordered it burned. It was "dangerous," "reprehensible," as well as "written in French," and in "the most seductive style." He declared readers excommunicated and wanted Diderot arrested on sight. But Diderot kept a step ahead
of being shut down, smuggling proofs outside France
for publication, and getting help from allies
in the French Regime, including the King's mistress,
Madame de Pompadour, and the royal librarian and censor,
Malesherbes, who tipped Diderot off to impending raids, and even hid Diderot's papers
at his dad's house. Still, he faced years of difficulty. D'Alembert dropped out. Rousseau broke off his friendship
over a line in a play. Worse yet, his publisher secretly
edited some proofs to read less radically. The uncensored pages reappeared 
in Russia in 1933, long after Diderot had considered
the work finished and died at lunch. The encyclopedia he left behind
is many things: a cornerstone of the Enlightenment, a testament 
to France's crisis of authority, evidence of popular opinions migration
from pulpit and pew to cafe, salon, and press. It even has recipes. It's also irrepressibly human, as you can tell from Diderot's entry
about a plant named aguaxima. Read it yourself, preferably out loud
in a French accent.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about who didn't contribute to the Encyclopedia, and the correct answer is "Hugo." Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 asks about a contributor who wrote a quarter of the encyclopedia's entries without receiving payment, and Question 1 asks about who commissioned Denis Diderot to adapt the English cyclopedia. However, none of these questions directly ask about who didn't contribute to the Encyclopedia.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4, as it at least deals with contributors to the Encyclopedia. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about who didn't contribute to the Encyclopedia.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with a weak match)

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the question content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: What significance did the encyclopedia hold in the context of the French Enlightenment?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the path to progress, one of its options (B) mentions "promoting independent investigative reasoning," which aligns with the correct option (B) in the ground truth MCQ. This option reflects the French Enlightenment's emphasis on independent thought and investigation as the path to progress.

However, an even more relevant question is not present among the provided options, but **Question 7** is the closest match in terms of intent and content.

If I had to choose an answer, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **7**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable question would be one that directly asks about the path to progress, with options that mirror the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Diderot's occupation before starting the Encyclopedia, specifically mentioning that he wrote sermons for priests.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ. However, I noticed that Question 1 mentions Diderot's commission to adapt the English cyclopedia, which is related to his occupation.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Diderot's occupation before starting the Encyclopedia. If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially relates to the ground truth MCQ's intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what Diderot did not criticize in the Encyclopedia, and the correct option is "Parisian laborers' low social stature." While none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, I found that Question 2 and Question 7 touch on Diderot's approach to the encyclopedia and its significance.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2. This question asks about the system Diderot used to organize the encyclopedia, which is based on Francis Bacon's "Classification of Knowledge." The question mentions that Diderot emphasized the importance of commerce, technology, and crafts, which might be indirectly related to his approach to writing about laborers.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 2 is only a distant match.

**Transcript**:
Denis Diderot left a dungeon
outside Paris on November 3, 1749. He'd had his writing 
burned in public before, but this time, he'd gotten locked up
under royal order for an essay about a philosopher's
death bed rejection of God. To free himself, Denis promised
never to write things like that again. So he got back to work 
on something a little like that, only way worse, and much bigger. In 1745, publisher André le Breton
had hired Diderot to adapt the English cyclopedia, or a universal dictionary 
of arts and sciences for French subscribers. A broke writer, Diderot survived
by translating, tutoring, and authoring sermons for priests, and a pornographic novel once. Le Breton paired him with co-editor
Jean le Rond d'Alembert, a math genius found 
on a church doorstep as a baby. Technical dictionaries, 
like the cyclopedia, weren't new, but no one had attempted one publication
covering all knowledge, so they did. The two men organized 
the French Enlightenment's brightest stars to produce the first encyclopedia, or rational dictionary of the arts,
sciences, and crafts. Assembling every essential fact
and principle in, as it turned out, over 70,000 entries, 20,000,000 words in 35 volumes of text and illustrations created over three decades
of researching, writing, arguging, smuggling, backstabbing, law-breaking, and alphabetizing. To organize the work, Diderot adapted Francis Bacon's
"Classification of Knowledge" into a three-part system based 
on the mind's approaches to reality: memory, reason, and imagination. He also emphasized the importance
of commerce, technology, and crafts, poking around shops to study the tools
and techniques of Parisian laborers. To spotlight a few of the nearly
150 philosoph contributers, Jean Jacques Rousseau,
Diderot's close friend, wrote much of the music section 
in three months, and was never reimbursed for copy fees. His entry on political economy holds ideas
he'd later develop further in "The Social Contract." D'Alembert wrote 
the famous preliminary discourse, a key statement 
of the French Enlightenment, championing independent 
investigative reasoning as the path to progress. Louis de Jaucourt wrote a quarter
of the encyclopedia, 18,000 articles, 5,000,000 words, unpaid. Louis once spent 20 years writing a book
on anatomy, shipped it to Amsterdam 
to be published uncensored, and the ship sank. Voltaire contributed entries, among them history, elegance, and fire. Diderot's entries sometimes 
exhibit slight bias. In "political authority," he dismantled
the divine right of kings. Under "citizen," he argued a state was strongest 
without great disparity in wealth. Not surprising from the guy who wrote
poetry about mankind strangling its kings with the entrails of a priest. So Diderot's masterpiece wasn't a hit
with the king or highest priest. Upon release of the first two volumes, Louie XV banned the whole thing
but enjoyed his own copy. Pope Clement XIII ordered it burned. It was "dangerous," "reprehensible," as well as "written in French," and in "the most seductive style." He declared readers excommunicated and wanted Diderot arrested on sight. But Diderot kept a step ahead
of being shut down, smuggling proofs outside France
for publication, and getting help from allies
in the French Regime, including the King's mistress,
Madame de Pompadour, and the royal librarian and censor,
Malesherbes, who tipped Diderot off to impending raids, and even hid Diderot's papers
at his dad's house. Still, he faced years of difficulty. D'Alembert dropped out. Rousseau broke off his friendship
over a line in a play. Worse yet, his publisher secretly
edited some proofs to read less radically. The uncensored pages reappeared 
in Russia in 1933, long after Diderot had considered
the work finished and died at lunch. The encyclopedia he left behind
is many things: a cornerstone of the Enlightenment, a testament 
to France's crisis of authority, evidence of popular opinions migration
from pulpit and pew to cafe, salon, and press. It even has recipes. It's also irrepressibly human, as you can tell from Diderot's entry
about a plant named aguaxima. Read it yourself, preferably out loud
in a French accent.

**Transcript**:
When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us 
a little differently. Depending on skin color, it will take
only minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience
the slightest change. So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on
so many different hues to begin with? Whatever the color, our skin tells an epic tale 
of human intrepidness and adaptability, revealing its variance to be 
a function of biology. It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives 
skin and hair its color. This ingredient comes from skin cells
called melanocytes and takes two basic forms. There's eumelanin, which gives rise
to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the
reddish browns of freckles and red hair. But humans weren't always like this. Our varying skin tones were formed
by an evolutionary process driven by the Sun. In began some 50,000 years ago when our
ancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia. These ancient humans lived between
the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, a region saturated 
by the Sun's UV-carrying rays. When skin is exposed to UV for long
periods of time, the UV light damages 
the DNA within our cells, and skin starts to burn. If that damage is severe enough, the cells mutations can lead to melanoma, a deadly cancer that forms 
in the skin's melanocytes. Sunscreen as we know it today
didn't exist 50,000 years ago. So how did our ancestors cope 
with this onslaught of UV? The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen manufactured beneath the skin: melanin. The type and amount 
of melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less
protected from the sun. This comes down to the skin's response
as sunlight strikes it. When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive 
receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin
to shield cells from damage. For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan. Over the course of generations, humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone. This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations. But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth. The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw. This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit. UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc. Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition 
known as rickets. For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed
a serious threat in the north. But some of them happened to produce
less melanin. They were exposed to small enough amounts
of light that melanoma was less likely, and their lighter skin 
better absorbed the UV light. So they benefited from vitamin D, developed strong bones, and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring. Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions
gradually lightened. As a result of 
our ancestor's adaptability, today the planet is full of people
with a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin
in the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich
skin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles. Therefore, skin color is little more than
an adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun. It may absorb light, but it certainly does not 
reflect character.

darkens their skin and produces a tan. Over the course of generations, humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone. This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations. But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth. The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw. This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit. UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc. Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition 
known as rickets. For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed
a serious threat in the north. But some of them happened to produce
less melanin. They were exposed to small enough amounts
of light that melanoma was less likely, and their lighter skin 
better absorbed the UV light. So they benefited from vitamin D, developed strong bones, and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring. Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions
gradually lightened. As a result of 
our ancestor's adaptability, today the planet is full of people
with a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin
in the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich
skin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles. Therefore, skin color is little more than
an adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun. It may absorb light, but it certainly does not 
reflect character.

**Transcript**:
When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us 
a little differently. Depending on skin color, it will take
only minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience
the slightest change. So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on
so many different hues to begin with? Whatever the color, our skin tells an epic tale 
of human intrepidness and adaptability, revealing its variance to be 
a function of biology. It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives 
skin and hair its color. This ingredient comes from skin cells
called melanocytes and takes two basic forms. There's eumelanin, which gives rise
to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the
reddish browns of freckles and red hair. But humans weren't always like this. Our varying skin tones were formed
by an evolutionary process driven by the Sun. In began some 50,000 years ago when our
ancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia. These ancient humans lived between
the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, a region saturated 
by the Sun's UV-carrying rays. When skin is exposed to UV for long
periods of time, the UV light damages 
the DNA within our cells, and skin starts to burn. If that damage is severe enough, the cells mutations can lead to melanoma, a deadly cancer that forms 
in the skin's melanocytes. Sunscreen as we know it today
didn't exist 50,000 years ago. So how did our ancestors cope 
with this onslaught of UV? The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen manufactured beneath the skin: melanin. The type and amount 
of melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less
protected from the sun. This comes down to the skin's response
as sunlight strikes it. When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive 
receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin
to shield cells from damage. For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan. Over the course of generations, humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone. This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations. But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth. The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw. This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit. UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc. Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition 
known as rickets. For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed

The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people
don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present. Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this
in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" (Laughter) It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form
of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility
for their actions, and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something
that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive
way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make
change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,
being straight and clear. The A is authenticity,
just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge
them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take
away and play with, which will increase
the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very
technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us
speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends
as if it were a question when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all is when you've got something
really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well
without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand
up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this
in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all
about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage
in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were
actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world
that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding
would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people
don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present. Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this
in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" (Laughter) It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form
of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility
for their actions, and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something
that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive
way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make
change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,
being straight and clear. The A is authenticity,
just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge
them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take
away and play with, which will increase
the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very
technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us
speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends
as if it were a question when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all is when you've got something
really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well
without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand
up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this

**Transcript**:
The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people
don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present. Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this
in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" (Laughter) It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form
of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility
for their actions, and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something
that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive
way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make
change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,
being straight and clear. The A is authenticity,
just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge
them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take
away and play with, which will increase
the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very
technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us
speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends
as if it were a question when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all is when you've got something
really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well
without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand
up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this
in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all
about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage
in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were
actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world
that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding
would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

Did you ever notice how many
jokes start with, "Did you ever notice?" And what's the deal with, 
"What's the deal?" There's a lot of funny to be found by simply noticing the ordinary, 
everyday things you don't ordinarily notice everyday. So if you'd like to add a little humor to that story, or speech, 
or screenplay you're writing, here are a few tips and tricks
for finding the funny. All great storytelling, 
including comedy writing, consists of a handful 
of basic ingredients: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Writers have been asking these questions
since at least the 1st century BC, yet none can be answered 
with a simple yes or no. They demand details, and the more specific the details,
the funnier the story. Let's start with the who,
the comedic character. Think about the books, TV shows,
and movies that make you laugh. They're usually filled with funny types,
or archetypes. The know-it-all, the loveable loser, the bad boss, the neurotic, the airhead. Incidentally, these are all stock 
characters found in Commedia Dell'Arte, or the artists comedy 
of late Renaissance Italy, and they have yet to get old. The Commedia rule for creating comic 
characters is find the flaw, then play it up. Or you can try playing with opposites. When the smartest guy in the room
does the stupidest thing, or the doofus outwits the brainiac, we tend to laugh because
we didn't see that coming. Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle
is said to have said, "The secret to humor is surprise." This surprise, 
or incongruity theory of humor, says we laugh at things 
that seem out of place or run up against our expectations, like a frog dating a pig, or a lizard selling insurance, a baby disco dancing, a nun disco dancing, a cat disco dancing. Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat
doing pretty much anything, especially involving disco. One fun way to find incongruities
is by drawing connections. Actually drawing them with a mind map. Start small. Pick a word, I choose pickle. Jot it down, then quick as you can,
try making connections. What do pickles make me think of? Who eats pickles? What treasured pickle memories
do I have from childhood? Another great way to generate
comedic material is to shift from observation
to imagination. Try going from "what is"
to "what if?" Like, what if instead of a horse,
for example, you just had a pair of coconuts? Okay, let's think of some other
memorable moments in history, literature, or film. Now, what if they featured coconuts? Get wild, let it go. Even if an idea seems overdone, or too obvious, or just plain dumb, try jotting it down, anyway. What's obvious to you
may not be to the next person. And the opposite of the dumbest idea
might just turn out to be the smartest. What about all that dumb stuff
that happens in real life? Have you ever noticed how much comedy
revolves around things that irritate, frustrate, 
and humiliate us? Will Rodgers said, "Everything's funny
as long as it happens to somebody else." So if you're having a crummy morning, imagine it happening to a character
you're writing about, and by afternoon, you may at least
get a funny story out of it. Once you've got your characters
and story, here are a few quick and easy comedy
writing tricks to make them zing. The rule of three, or zig zig zag. Try setting up an expected pattern,
zig zig, then flip it, zag. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a bar. The punchline rule says put your punch
at the end of the line. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a disco. That brings up the rule of K. For some reason, words with a k-sound
catch our ears and are considered comical. Coconut, disco, pickles, crickets? Okay, so we don't always get the laugh. Humor is subjective. Comedy is trial and error. Writing is rewriting. Just keep trying. Find the flaws, discover the details, insert incongruities, incorporate k-words, and remember the most important rule
of writing funny: have fun. As Charles Dickins said, "There is nothing in the world so
irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor." And disco.

or archetypes. The know-it-all, the loveable loser, the bad boss, the neurotic, the airhead. Incidentally, these are all stock 
characters found in Commedia Dell'Arte, or the artists comedy 
of late Renaissance Italy, and they have yet to get old. The Commedia rule for creating comic 
characters is find the flaw, then play it up. Or you can try playing with opposites. When the smartest guy in the room
does the stupidest thing, or the doofus outwits the brainiac, we tend to laugh because
we didn't see that coming. Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle
is said to have said, "The secret to humor is surprise." This surprise, 
or incongruity theory of humor, says we laugh at things 
that seem out of place or run up against our expectations, like a frog dating a pig, or a lizard selling insurance, a baby disco dancing, a nun disco dancing, a cat disco dancing. Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat
doing pretty much anything, especially involving disco. One fun way to find incongruities
is by drawing connections. Actually drawing them with a mind map. Start small. Pick a word, I choose pickle. Jot it down, then quick as you can,
try making connections. What do pickles make me think of? Who eats pickles? What treasured pickle memories
do I have from childhood? Another great way to generate
comedic material is to shift from observation
to imagination. Try going from "what is"
to "what if?" Like, what if instead of a horse,
for example, you just had a pair of coconuts? Okay, let's think of some other
memorable moments in history, literature, or film. Now, what if they featured coconuts? Get wild, let it go. Even if an idea seems overdone, or too obvious, or just plain dumb, try jotting it down, anyway. What's obvious to you
may not be to the next person. And the opposite of the dumbest idea
might just turn out to be the smartest. What about all that dumb stuff
that happens in real life? Have you ever noticed how much comedy
revolves around things that irritate, frustrate, 
and humiliate us? Will Rodgers said, "Everything's funny
as long as it happens to somebody else." So if you're having a crummy morning, imagine it happening to a character
you're writing about, and by afternoon, you may at least
get a funny story out of it. Once you've got your characters
and story, here are a few quick and easy comedy
writing tricks to make them zing. The rule of three, or zig zig zag. Try setting up an expected pattern,
zig zig, then flip it, zag. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a bar. The punchline rule says put your punch
at the end of the line. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a disco. That brings up the rule of K. For some reason, words with a k-sound
catch our ears and are considered comical. Coconut, disco, pickles, crickets? Okay, so we don't always get the laugh. Humor is subjective. Comedy is trial and error. Writing is rewriting. Just keep trying. Find the flaws, discover the details, insert incongruities, incorporate k-words, and remember the most important rule
of writing funny: have fun. As Charles Dickins said, "There is nothing in the world so
irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor." And disco.

Imagine something small enough to float
on a particle of dust that holds the keys to understanding
cancer, virology, and genetics. Luckily for us, such a thing exists in the form 
of trillions upon trillions of human lab-grown cells
called HeLa. Let's take a step back for a second. Scientists grow human cells in the lab
to study how they function, understand how diseases develop, and test new treatments without
endangering patients. To make sure that they can repeat
these experiments over and over, and compare the results 
with other scientists, they need huge populations 
of identical cells that can duplicate themselves 
faithfully for years, but until 1951, all human cell lines
that researchers tried to grow had died after a few days. Then a John Hopkins scientist
named George Gey received a sample of 
a strange looking tumor: dark purple, shiny, jelly-like. This sample was special. Some of its cells just kept dividing, and dividing, and dividing. When individual cells died, generations of copies took their place
and thrived. The result was an endless source of
identical cells that's still around today. The very first immortal human cell line. Gey labeled it "HeLa" after the patient
with the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks. Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia, she lived in Baltimore with her husband
and five children. She died of aggressive cervical cancer a few months after her tumorous cells
were harvested, and she never knew about them. So what's so special about the cells
from Henrietta Lacks that lets them survive
when other cell lines die? The short answer is
we don't entirely know. Normal human cells have built-in
control mechanisms. They can divide about 50 times
before they self destruct in a process called apoptosis. This prevents the propagation
of genetic errors that creep in after 
repeated rounds of division. But cancer cells ignore these signals,
dividing indefinitely and crowding out normal cells. Still, most cell lines eventually die off,
especially outside the human body. Not HeLa, though, and that's the part
we can't yet explain. Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had
the first immortal line of human cells, he sent samples 
to labs all over the world. Soon the world's first 
cell production facility was churning out 
6 trillion HeLa cells a week, and scientists put them to work
in an ethically problematic way, building careers and fortunes
off of Henrietta's cells without her or her family's consent,
or even knowledge until decades later. The polio epidemic was at its peak
in the early 50s. HeLa cells, which easily took up
and replicated the virus, allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine. They've been used to study diseases, including measles, mumps, HIV, and ebola. We know that human 
cells have 46 chromosomes because a scientist working with HeLa
discovered a chemcial that makes chromosomes visible. HeLa cells themselves actually have
around 80 highly mutated chromosomes. HeLa cells were the first to be cloned. They've traveled to outer space. Telomerase, an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade
destruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical
cancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled
thousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher
than anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they 
can travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells 
and taking over like weeds, countless cures, patents and discoveries
all made thanks to Henrieta Lacks.

were harvested, and she never knew about them. So what's so special about the cells
from Henrietta Lacks that lets them survive
when other cell lines die? The short answer is
we don't entirely know. Normal human cells have built-in
control mechanisms. They can divide about 50 times
before they self destruct in a process called apoptosis. This prevents the propagation
of genetic errors that creep in after 
repeated rounds of division. But cancer cells ignore these signals,
dividing indefinitely and crowding out normal cells. Still, most cell lines eventually die off,
especially outside the human body. Not HeLa, though, and that's the part
we can't yet explain. Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had
the first immortal line of human cells, he sent samples 
to labs all over the world. Soon the world's first 
cell production facility was churning out 
6 trillion HeLa cells a week, and scientists put them to work
in an ethically problematic way, building careers and fortunes
off of Henrietta's cells without her or her family's consent,
or even knowledge until decades later. The polio epidemic was at its peak
in the early 50s. HeLa cells, which easily took up
and replicated the virus, allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine. They've been used to study diseases, including measles, mumps, HIV, and ebola. We know that human 
cells have 46 chromosomes because a scientist working with HeLa
discovered a chemcial that makes chromosomes visible. HeLa cells themselves actually have
around 80 highly mutated chromosomes. HeLa cells were the first to be cloned. They've traveled to outer space. Telomerase, an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade
destruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical
cancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled
thousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher
than anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they 
can travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells

Imagine something small enough to float
on a particle of dust that holds the keys to understanding
cancer, virology, and genetics. Luckily for us, such a thing exists in the form 
of trillions upon trillions of human lab-grown cells
called HeLa. Let's take a step back for a second. Scientists grow human cells in the lab
to study how they function, understand how diseases develop, and test new treatments without
endangering patients. To make sure that they can repeat
these experiments over and over, and compare the results 
with other scientists, they need huge populations 
of identical cells that can duplicate themselves 
faithfully for years, but until 1951, all human cell lines
that researchers tried to grow had died after a few days. Then a John Hopkins scientist
named George Gey received a sample of 
a strange looking tumor: dark purple, shiny, jelly-like. This sample was special. Some of its cells just kept dividing, and dividing, and dividing. When individual cells died, generations of copies took their place
and thrived. The result was an endless source of
identical cells that's still around today. The very first immortal human cell line. Gey labeled it "HeLa" after the patient
with the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks. Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia, she lived in Baltimore with her husband
and five children. She died of aggressive cervical cancer a few months after her tumorous cells

destruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical
cancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled
thousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher
than anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they 
can travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells 
and taking over like weeds, countless cures, patents and discoveries
all made thanks to Henrieta Lacks.

**Transcript**:
There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together, when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives. But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land, and became central in many rituals
and traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds. Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged
on the tree for decades. Cones that fall to the ground
can be viable for several years, as well. But when temperatures get high enough,
the cones pop open. Let's see that in action. Once it's gotten started,
a coniferous forest fire typically spreads something like this. Flames ravage the thick understory
provided by species like douglas fir, a shade-tolerant tree 
that's able to thrive under the canopy 
of lodgepole pines. The fire uses these smaller trees
as a step ladder to reach the higher canopy 
of old lodgepole pines. That ignites a tremendous crown fire reaching temperatures 
of up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's well more than the 115-140 degrees that signal the moment 
when serotinous seeds can be freed. At those temperatures,
the cones burst open, releasing millions of seeds, which are carried by the hot air
to form new forests. After the fire, carbon-rich soils
and an open sunlit landscape help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly
and sprout in abundance. From the death of the old forest
comes the birth of the new. Fires are also important
for the wider ecosystem as a whole. Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,
key forest species would disappear, and so would the many creatures
that depend on them. And if a fire-dependent forest
goes too long without burning, that raises the risk 
of a catastrophic blaze, which could destroy a forest completely, not to mention people's homes and lives. That's why forest rangers sometimes
intentionally start controlled burns to reduce fuels in order to keep
the more dangerous wildfires at bay. They may be frightening
and destructive forces of nature, but wildfires are also vital to the existence of healthy 
boreal forest ecosystems. By coming to terms with that, we can protect ourselves from their
more damaging effects while enabling the forests,
like the legendary phoenix, to rise reborn from their own ashes.

**Transcript**:
There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together, when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives. But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land, and became central in many rituals
and traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds. Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged
on the tree for decades. Cones that fall to the ground
can be viable for several years, as well. But when temperatures get high enough,
the cones pop open. Let's see that in action. Once it's gotten started,
a coniferous forest fire typically spreads something like this. Flames ravage the thick understory
provided by species like douglas fir, a shade-tolerant tree 
that's able to thrive under the canopy 
of lodgepole pines. The fire uses these smaller trees
as a step ladder to reach the higher canopy 
of old lodgepole pines. That ignites a tremendous crown fire reaching temperatures 
of up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's well more than the 115-140 degrees that signal the moment 
when serotinous seeds can be freed. At those temperatures,
the cones burst open, releasing millions of seeds, which are carried by the hot air
to form new forests. After the fire, carbon-rich soils
and an open sunlit landscape help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly
and sprout in abundance. From the death of the old forest
comes the birth of the new. Fires are also important
for the wider ecosystem as a whole. Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,
key forest species would disappear, and so would the many creatures
that depend on them. And if a fire-dependent forest
goes too long without burning, that raises the risk 
of a catastrophic blaze, which could destroy a forest completely, not to mention people's homes and lives. That's why forest rangers sometimes
intentionally start controlled burns to reduce fuels in order to keep
the more dangerous wildfires at bay. They may be frightening
and destructive forces of nature, but wildfires are also vital to the existence of healthy 
boreal forest ecosystems. By coming to terms with that, we can protect ourselves from their
more damaging effects while enabling the forests,
like the legendary phoenix, to rise reborn from their own ashes.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about wildfires reaching the crown of lodgepole pines using smaller trees as a "stepladder." But Question 7 mentions the relationship between lodgepole pines and smaller trees (Douglas fir), which is relevant to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would select Question 7. However, I want to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
You've found the hidden switches, evaded the secret traps, and now your expedition finally stands at the heart of the ancient temple
inside The Lost City. But as you study the inscriptions
in the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students
accompanying you bump into the alter. Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke
burst forth and the walls begin to shake. Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before
with five hallways, including the one to the altar
and the one leading back outside. The giant sandglass in the center
is now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't 
want to be around when that happens. From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach
the exit at a fast pace. You know this is the last junction
before the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way. If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four
halls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making 
a run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told 
of the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen
possessing intruders and leading them to their doom
through deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students
have been cursed. At any time, 
one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse
didn't get you, but you don't know which students
can't be trusted, and because the possessed students
may lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test
them to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure
that you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects
their communication. Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since
you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students 
for the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two
of the paths won't work because if one group came back split
two versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair
and two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie,
or they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will 
always tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give
the same report or argue about 
whether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, 
you can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence
about three of the four paths. The fourth you can figure out
using the process of elimination. Of course, none of this matters if you're
lucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together
leaves you with three possibilities. If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students 
are paired together. In either case, ignore the duo. If there's only one group arguing,
both others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students
are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority
in both trios since at least two people in each
will be truthful. The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors 
escape from two of the students. You're all safe and free from the curse. After that ordeal, you tell your group 
they all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have
another expedition coming up.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Would seven expeditioners have been enough if both liars definitely will lie about whether they find the exit?
Options: A. No, then some pair of paths would have been explored by four people or fewer and that’s not enough if there are two liars in the group, B. No, no odd number will work, C. Yes
Correct Option: A

They were unable to communicate with the others, C. They might lie or tell the truth at any time, D. They were forced to tell the truth at all times Correct Option: C
Question 3: Why did the professor decide to split the eight students into one pair and two trios to explore the remaining three paths? Options: A. To ensure that the possessed students would be in the same group, B. To guarantee that at least one group would find the exit, C. To increase the chances of getting reliable evidence about three of the four paths, D. To reduce the number of students exploring each path Correct Option: C
Question 4: What would the professor infer if a trio returned to the hall in total agreement about finding the exit? Options: A. At least one of them was lying, B. None of them were lying, C. The professor would have to guess who to trust, D. The professor would send them to explore another path Correct Option: B
Question 5: What was the purpose of the professor exploring one of the halls alone? Options: A. To test the curse on himself, B. To find the exit quickly, C. To reduce the number of students exploring each path, D. To ensure that he could provide a reliable report Correct Option: D
Question 6: If each group gave a consistent answer about finding the exit, what would the professor do? Options: A. Trust the majority in each group, B. Ignore the duo and trust the trios, C. Trust the duo and ignore the trios, D. Guess which group to trust Correct Option: B

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the minimum number of expeditioners required to ensure escape if both liars definitely will lie about whether they find the exit. The correct answer is A, which states that seven expeditioners would not be enough.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most similar in terms of content and intent. It asks about the professor's strategy for splitting the students into groups to explore the remaining paths. While it does not directly address the minimum number of expeditioners required, it does relate to the problem-solving strategy in the face of uncertain information.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would suggest Question 5. It asks about the purpose of the professor exploring one of the halls alone, which is related to ensuring reliable information in the face of uncertainty.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly address the minimum number of expeditioners required, I must conclude that there is no exact match.

If I had to choose, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is: Question 3 or Question 5 (but not exactly matching).

However, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ as: 3

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about a hypothetical scenario where the expeditioners are divided into groups of four and four, and the question asks in which situations they would not know which path to escape from.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks why the professor decided to split the eight students into one pair and two trios to explore the remaining three paths. Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same scenario and discusses the professor's strategy for dividing the students into groups.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 9 is more relevant to the ground truth MCQ. Question 9 asks how the professor planned to figure out which path led to the exit if the groups' reports were inconsistent. This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and content, as it deals with the professor's strategy for determining the correct path in a scenario where the groups' reports may be inconsistent.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You've found the hidden switches, evaded the secret traps, and now your expedition finally stands at the heart of the ancient temple
inside The Lost City. But as you study the inscriptions
in the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students
accompanying you bump into the alter. Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke
burst forth and the walls begin to shake. Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before
with five hallways, including the one to the altar
and the one leading back outside. The giant sandglass in the center
is now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't 
want to be around when that happens. From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach
the exit at a fast pace. You know this is the last junction
before the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way. If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four
halls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making 
a run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told 
of the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen
possessing intruders and leading them to their doom
through deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students
have been cursed. At any time, 
one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse
didn't get you, but you don't know which students
can't be trusted, and because the possessed students
may lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test
them to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure
that you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects
their communication. Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since
you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students 
for the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two
of the paths won't work because if one group came back split
two versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair
and two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie,
or they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will 
always tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give
the same report or argue about 
whether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, 
you can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence
about three of the four paths. The fourth you can figure out
using the process of elimination. Of course, none of this matters if you're
lucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together
leaves you with three possibilities. If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students 
are paired together. In either case, ignore the duo. If there's only one group arguing,
both others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students
are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority
in both trios since at least two people in each
will be truthful. The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors 
escape from two of the students. You're all safe and free from the curse. After that ordeal, you tell your group 
they all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have
another expedition coming up.

**Transcript**:
The epic poem "La Dragontea" describes how English explorer
Sir Francis Drake sailed across the Gulf of Venezuela
in 1595. He was aiming for
the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish 
about his approach. Lake Maracaibo is 
the stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water
at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges that steadily build
up inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds
and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year, averaging out to 11 strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer on account of the Sun providing
more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge
down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet— a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
The epic poem "La Dragontea" describes how English explorer
Sir Francis Drake sailed across the Gulf of Venezuela
in 1595. He was aiming for
the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish 
about his approach. Lake Maracaibo is 
the stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water
at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges that steadily build
up inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds
and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year, averaging out to 11 strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer on account of the Sun providing
more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge
down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet— a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas.

**Transcript**:
Would you like to know 
what's in our future? What's going to happen tomorrow,
next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries
to industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people
called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this
with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as
the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists
and futurists who together forecast 
many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up
research material for the reader. One way futurists arrive
at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends
in society, and charting the paths they are likely
to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions
of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh 
options for the future that otherwise could not have 
been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how
certain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable 
discoveries that arise which would make no sense
to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist 
from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material
exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough
energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. "How can such energy come from nowhere?"
he would demand to know. "That's not science, that's magic." And for all intents and purposes,
he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity
or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future
could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic." How can we prepare, then, for a future
that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone
from the 19th century? We may think our modern technology
and advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future
with much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it's also true that our 
technological progress has brought with it new increasingly 
complex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to
be able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been
with us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation 
for our modern world. During this time of explosive development
and invention, a new form of literature, science fiction,
also emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day,
Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored
fantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century
and into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their
visions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects
of the world we inhabit decades later. In "Brave New World," Aldous Huxley foretold 
the use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication 
became popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
forecast earbuds, "thimble radios," in his words. And in "2001: A Space Odyssey," Arthur C. Clarke described a portable,
flat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment
and social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief
and consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar 
and deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills 
the words of philosopher Michel Foucault, "I'm no prophet. My job is making windows
where there were once walls." Free from the constraints of the present
and our assumptions of what's impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool
for thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ
science fictions writers in their teams. Just recently, a project called iKnow
proposed scenarios that look much 
like science fiction stories. They include the discovery of
an alien civilization, development of a way for humans
and animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can't know for certain, but science fiction 
shows us many possibilities. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to determine which 
we will work towards making a reality.

**Transcript**:
Would you like to know 
what's in our future? What's going to happen tomorrow,
next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries
to industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people
called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this
with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as
the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists
and futurists who together forecast 
many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up
research material for the reader. One way futurists arrive
at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends
in society, and charting the paths they are likely
to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions
of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh 
options for the future that otherwise could not have 
been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how
certain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable 
discoveries that arise which would make no sense
to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist 
from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material
exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough
energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. "How can such energy come from nowhere?"
he would demand to know. "That's not science, that's magic." And for all intents and purposes,
he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity
or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future
could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about the difficulty of forecasting social changes in advance, and the correct answer is that all of the above options are correct. While Question 4 does not directly ask about social changes, it does address the main challenge in predicting the future, which is related to the idea that there are always unimaginable discoveries that can arise at any time. This concept is relevant to the ground truth MCQ, as it implies that our current understanding and models may not be sufficient to accurately forecast social changes.

Although the match is not perfect, Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The other generated MCQs do not directly address the challenge of forecasting social changes or the limitations of our current understanding.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 7 does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent of asking about technological advances that were NOT forecast by science fiction writers, I re-evaluated the options.

A more suitable match is not available, but if I had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing the limitations of predicting the future, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's topic of technological advances that were not forecast.

But since Question 4 does not specifically ask about technological advances or science fiction writers, I must conclude that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but with the caveat that it's not a close match.

**Transcript**:
Would you like to know 
what's in our future? What's going to happen tomorrow,
next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries
to industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people
called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this
with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as
the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists
and futurists who together forecast 
many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up
research material for the reader. One way futurists arrive
at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends
in society, and charting the paths they are likely
to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions
of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh 
options for the future that otherwise could not have 
been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how
certain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable 
discoveries that arise which would make no sense
to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist 
from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material
exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough
energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. "How can such energy come from nowhere?"
he would demand to know. "That's not science, that's magic." And for all intents and purposes,
he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity
or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future
could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic." How can we prepare, then, for a future
that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone
from the 19th century? We may think our modern technology
and advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future
with much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it's also true that our 
technological progress has brought with it new increasingly 
complex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to
be able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been
with us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation 
for our modern world. During this time of explosive development
and invention, a new form of literature, science fiction,
also emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day,
Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored
fantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century
and into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their
visions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects
of the world we inhabit decades later. In "Brave New World," Aldous Huxley foretold 
the use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication 
became popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
forecast earbuds, "thimble radios," in his words. And in "2001: A Space Odyssey," Arthur C. Clarke described a portable,
flat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment
and social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief
and consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar 
and deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills 
the words of philosopher Michel Foucault, "I'm no prophet. My job is making windows
where there were once walls." Free from the constraints of the present
and our assumptions of what's impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool
for thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ
science fictions writers in their teams. Just recently, a project called iKnow
proposed scenarios that look much 
like science fiction stories. They include the discovery of
an alien civilization, development of a way for humans
and animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can't know for certain, but science fiction 
shows us many possibilities. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to determine which 
we will work towards making a reality.

**Transcript**:
Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns
mirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry
is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells'
always coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up
their trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body
looks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs 
are arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas
lie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver
are on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes,
and the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar,
but function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed
the right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped,
a condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical
on the right and left. One theory focuses 
on a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs
called cilia, while tilt away from the head
and whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid
from the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes
on the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells
to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo
are chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually
translated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube
along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo 
is around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards 
the right side of the body. It grows different 
structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar
asymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs
emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,
don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be 
intrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches
that all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured 
inside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up 
like the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many 
of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,
are inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control 
which way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules 
have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule 
and its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, 
they look the same, but trying to put your right
in your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level
is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not directly address the concept of climbing plants, it does touch on the idea that some organisms exhibit asymmetry without a clear external cause (in this case, the lack of embryonic cilia in pigs). This relates to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the direction of climbing plants, implying that there might be an intrinsic or biological basis for the asymmetry observed in nature.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options. The generated MCQs primarily focus on the asymmetry of internal organs, embryonic development, and biomolecules, whereas the ground truth MCQ addresses the direction of climbing plants.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 8 is the closest match, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

However, Question 3 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the primary function of the cilia, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the direction of fluid flow. 

A more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the direction of fluid flow. Since no such question exists among the generated MCQs, we can consider Question 4, which mentions the synchronized rotation of cilia pushing fluid from the right side to the left. 

But the best match is actually Question 3's correct option B, which is "To push fluid from the right side to the left side of the embryo." 

However, if we were to choose an entire question that best matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be Question 4.

However, another generated MCQ, which is not listed, could potentially be: 
What is the direction of fluid flow at the node that leads to the asymmetric positioning of internal organs? 
Options: A. Left, B. Right, C. Head, D. Feet 

Since this is not among our choices, we choose the closest match.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 4

**Transcript**:
Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns
mirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry
is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells'
always coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up
their trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body
looks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs 
are arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas
lie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver
are on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes,
and the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar,
but function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed
the right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped,
a condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical
on the right and left. One theory focuses 
on a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs
called cilia, while tilt away from the head
and whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid
from the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes
on the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells
to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo
are chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually
translated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube
along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo 
is around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards 
the right side of the body. It grows different 
structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar
asymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs
emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,
don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be 
intrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches
that all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured 
inside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up 
like the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many 
of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,
are inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control 
which way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules 
have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule 
and its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, 
they look the same, but trying to put your right
in your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level
is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the organ that is first observed for its left-right asymmetry during embryonic development, and the correct answer is the heart. Question 5 discusses the development of the heart, specifically how it changes shape from a straight tube to a c-shape and rotates to one side of the body, which is related to the concept of left-right asymmetry.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 5, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
About 66 million years ago, something terrible happened
to life on our planet. Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening 
all around us today. Environments change, pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities
for others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives. And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record, where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned, some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment, creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods 
have become so effective that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today
as environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact
on the world from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future.

**Transcript**:
About 66 million years ago, something terrible happened
to life on our planet. Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening 
all around us today. Environments change, pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities
for others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives. And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record, where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned, some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment, creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods 
have become so effective that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today
as environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact
on the world from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the possible causes of mass extinctions identified by paleontologists and asks which one has NOT been identified as an agent of mass extinction. The correct option is "Forest fires".

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is related to mass extinctions, but it asks about the term that describes the sudden disappearance of thousands of species due to massive changes in the environment.

However, I would suggest that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it asks about the primary cause of the extinction of certain species and provides options that include human activity and climate change, which are related to the topic of mass extinctions. Nevertheless, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low confidence level.

Index: 5

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not cover the same topic as the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically address the topic of possible causes of mass extinctions identified by paleontologists.

**Transcript**:
Denis Diderot left a dungeon
outside Paris on November 3, 1749. He'd had his writing 
burned in public before, but this time, he'd gotten locked up
under royal order for an essay about a philosopher's
death bed rejection of God. To free himself, Denis promised
never to write things like that again. So he got back to work 
on something a little like that, only way worse, and much bigger. In 1745, publisher André le Breton
had hired Diderot to adapt the English cyclopedia, or a universal dictionary 
of arts and sciences for French subscribers. A broke writer, Diderot survived
by translating, tutoring, and authoring sermons for priests, and a pornographic novel once. Le Breton paired him with co-editor
Jean le Rond d'Alembert, a math genius found 
on a church doorstep as a baby. Technical dictionaries, 
like the cyclopedia, weren't new, but no one had attempted one publication
covering all knowledge, so they did. The two men organized 
the French Enlightenment's brightest stars to produce the first encyclopedia, or rational dictionary of the arts,
sciences, and crafts. Assembling every essential fact
and principle in, as it turned out, over 70,000 entries, 20,000,000 words in 35 volumes of text and illustrations created over three decades
of researching, writing, arguging, smuggling, backstabbing, law-breaking, and alphabetizing. To organize the work, Diderot adapted Francis Bacon's
"Classification of Knowledge" into a three-part system based 
on the mind's approaches to reality: memory, reason, and imagination. He also emphasized the importance
of commerce, technology, and crafts, poking around shops to study the tools
and techniques of Parisian laborers. To spotlight a few of the nearly
150 philosoph contributers, Jean Jacques Rousseau,
Diderot's close friend, wrote much of the music section 
in three months, and was never reimbursed for copy fees. His entry on political economy holds ideas
he'd later develop further in "The Social Contract." D'Alembert wrote 
the famous preliminary discourse, a key statement 
of the French Enlightenment, championing independent 
investigative reasoning as the path to progress. Louis de Jaucourt wrote a quarter
of the encyclopedia, 18,000 articles, 5,000,000 words, unpaid. Louis once spent 20 years writing a book
on anatomy, shipped it to Amsterdam 
to be published uncensored, and the ship sank. Voltaire contributed entries, among them history, elegance, and fire. Diderot's entries sometimes 
exhibit slight bias. In "political authority," he dismantled
the divine right of kings. Under "citizen," he argued a state was strongest 
without great disparity in wealth. Not surprising from the guy who wrote
poetry about mankind strangling its kings with the entrails of a priest. So Diderot's masterpiece wasn't a hit
with the king or highest priest. Upon release of the first two volumes, Louie XV banned the whole thing
but enjoyed his own copy. Pope Clement XIII ordered it burned. It was "dangerous," "reprehensible," as well as "written in French," and in "the most seductive style." He declared readers excommunicated and wanted Diderot arrested on sight. But Diderot kept a step ahead
of being shut down, smuggling proofs outside France
for publication, and getting help from allies
in the French Regime, including the King's mistress,
Madame de Pompadour, and the royal librarian and censor,
Malesherbes, who tipped Diderot off to impending raids, and even hid Diderot's papers
at his dad's house. Still, he faced years of difficulty. D'Alembert dropped out. Rousseau broke off his friendship
over a line in a play. Worse yet, his publisher secretly
edited some proofs to read less radically. The uncensored pages reappeared 
in Russia in 1933, long after Diderot had considered
the work finished and died at lunch. The encyclopedia he left behind
is many things: a cornerstone of the Enlightenment, a testament 
to France's crisis of authority, evidence of popular opinions migration
from pulpit and pew to cafe, salon, and press. It even has recipes. It's also irrepressibly human, as you can tell from Diderot's entry
about a plant named aguaxima. Read it yourself, preferably out loud
in a French accent.

**Transcript**:
Denis Diderot left a dungeon
outside Paris on November 3, 1749. He'd had his writing 
burned in public before, but this time, he'd gotten locked up
under royal order for an essay about a philosopher's
death bed rejection of God. To free himself, Denis promised
never to write things like that again. So he got back to work 
on something a little like that, only way worse, and much bigger. In 1745, publisher André le Breton
had hired Diderot to adapt the English cyclopedia, or a universal dictionary 
of arts and sciences for French subscribers. A broke writer, Diderot survived
by translating, tutoring, and authoring sermons for priests, and a pornographic novel once. Le Breton paired him with co-editor
Jean le Rond d'Alembert, a math genius found 
on a church doorstep as a baby. Technical dictionaries, 
like the cyclopedia, weren't new, but no one had attempted one publication
covering all knowledge, so they did. The two men organized 
the French Enlightenment's brightest stars to produce the first encyclopedia, or rational dictionary of the arts,
sciences, and crafts. Assembling every essential fact
and principle in, as it turned out, over 70,000 entries, 20,000,000 words in 35 volumes of text and illustrations created over three decades
of researching, writing, arguging, smuggling, backstabbing, law-breaking, and alphabetizing. To organize the work, Diderot adapted Francis Bacon's
"Classification of Knowledge" into a three-part system based 
on the mind's approaches to reality: memory, reason, and imagination. He also emphasized the importance
of commerce, technology, and crafts, poking around shops to study the tools
and techniques of Parisian laborers. To spotlight a few of the nearly
150 philosoph contributers, Jean Jacques Rousseau,
Diderot's close friend, wrote much of the music section 
in three months, and was never reimbursed for copy fees. His entry on political economy holds ideas
he'd later develop further in "The Social Contract." D'Alembert wrote 
the famous preliminary discourse, a key statement 
of the French Enlightenment, championing independent 
investigative reasoning as the path to progress. Louis de Jaucourt wrote a quarter
of the encyclopedia, 18,000 articles, 5,000,000 words, unpaid. Louis once spent 20 years writing a book
on anatomy, shipped it to Amsterdam 
to be published uncensored, and the ship sank. Voltaire contributed entries, among them history, elegance, and fire. Diderot's entries sometimes 
exhibit slight bias. In "political authority," he dismantled
the divine right of kings. Under "citizen," he argued a state was strongest 
without great disparity in wealth. Not surprising from the guy who wrote
poetry about mankind strangling its kings with the entrails of a priest. So Diderot's masterpiece wasn't a hit
with the king or highest priest. Upon release of the first two volumes, Louie XV banned the whole thing
but enjoyed his own copy. Pope Clement XIII ordered it burned. It was "dangerous," "reprehensible," as well as "written in French," and in "the most seductive style." He declared readers excommunicated and wanted Diderot arrested on sight. But Diderot kept a step ahead
of being shut down, smuggling proofs outside France
for publication, and getting help from allies
in the French Regime, including the King's mistress,
Madame de Pompadour, and the royal librarian and censor,
Malesherbes, who tipped Diderot off to impending raids, and even hid Diderot's papers
at his dad's house. Still, he faced years of difficulty. D'Alembert dropped out. Rousseau broke off his friendship
over a line in a play. Worse yet, his publisher secretly

**Transcript**:
When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us 
a little differently. Depending on skin color, it will take
only minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience
the slightest change. So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on
so many different hues to begin with? Whatever the color, our skin tells an epic tale 
of human intrepidness and adaptability, revealing its variance to be 
a function of biology. It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives 
skin and hair its color. This ingredient comes from skin cells
called melanocytes and takes two basic forms. There's eumelanin, which gives rise
to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the
reddish browns of freckles and red hair. But humans weren't always like this. Our varying skin tones were formed
by an evolutionary process driven by the Sun. In began some 50,000 years ago when our
ancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia. These ancient humans lived between
the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, a region saturated 
by the Sun's UV-carrying rays. When skin is exposed to UV for long
periods of time, the UV light damages 
the DNA within our cells, and skin starts to burn. If that damage is severe enough, the cells mutations can lead to melanoma, a deadly cancer that forms 
in the skin's melanocytes. Sunscreen as we know it today
didn't exist 50,000 years ago. So how did our ancestors cope 
with this onslaught of UV? The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen manufactured beneath the skin: melanin. The type and amount 
of melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less
protected from the sun. This comes down to the skin's response
as sunlight strikes it. When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive 
receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin
to shield cells from damage. For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan. Over the course of generations, humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone. This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations. But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth. The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw. This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit. UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc. Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition 
known as rickets. For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed
a serious threat in the north. But some of them happened to produce
less melanin. They were exposed to small enough amounts
of light that melanoma was less likely, and their lighter skin 
better absorbed the UV light. So they benefited from vitamin D, developed strong bones, and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring. Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions
gradually lightened. As a result of 
our ancestor's adaptability, today the planet is full of people
with a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin
in the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich
skin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles. Therefore, skin color is little more than
an adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun. It may absorb light, but it certainly does not 
reflect character.

**Transcript**:
When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us 
a little differently. Depending on skin color, it will take
only minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience
the slightest change. So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on
so many different hues to begin with? Whatever the color, our skin tells an epic tale 
of human intrepidness and adaptability, revealing its variance to be 
a function of biology. It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives 
skin and hair its color. This ingredient comes from skin cells
called melanocytes and takes two basic forms. There's eumelanin, which gives rise
to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the
reddish browns of freckles and red hair. But humans weren't always like this. Our varying skin tones were formed
by an evolutionary process driven by the Sun. In began some 50,000 years ago when our
ancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia. These ancient humans lived between
the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, a region saturated 
by the Sun's UV-carrying rays. When skin is exposed to UV for long
periods of time, the UV light damages 
the DNA within our cells, and skin starts to burn. If that damage is severe enough, the cells mutations can lead to melanoma, a deadly cancer that forms 
in the skin's melanocytes. Sunscreen as we know it today
didn't exist 50,000 years ago. So how did our ancestors cope 
with this onslaught of UV? The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen manufactured beneath the skin: melanin. The type and amount 
of melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less
protected from the sun. This comes down to the skin's response
as sunlight strikes it. When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive 
receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin
to shield cells from damage. For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan. Over the course of generations, humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone. This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations. But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth. The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw. This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit. UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc. Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition 
known as rickets. For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed
a serious threat in the north. But some of them happened to produce
less melanin. They were exposed to small enough amounts
of light that melanoma was less likely, and their lighter skin 
better absorbed the UV light. So they benefited from vitamin D, developed strong bones, and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring. Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions
gradually lightened. As a result of 
our ancestor's adaptability, today the planet is full of people
with a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin
in the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich
skin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles. Therefore, skin color is little more than
an adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun. It may absorb light, but it certainly does not 
reflect character.

**Transcript**:
The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people
don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present. Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this
in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" (Laughter) It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form
of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility
for their actions, and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something
that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive
way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make
change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,
being straight and clear. The A is authenticity,
just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge
them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take
away and play with, which will increase
the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very
technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us
speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends
as if it were a question when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all is when you've got something
really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well
without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand
up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this
in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all
about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage
in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were
actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world
that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding
would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people
don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present. Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this
in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" (Laughter) It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form
of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility
for their actions, and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something
that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive
way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make
change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,
being straight and clear. The A is authenticity,
just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge
them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take
away and play with, which will increase
the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very
technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us
speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends
as if it were a question when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all is when you've got something
really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself

up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you." And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people
don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present. Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this
in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" (Laughter) It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form
of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility
for their actions, and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something
that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive
way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make
change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,
being straight and clear. The A is authenticity,
just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge
them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take
away and play with, which will increase
the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very
technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us
speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends
as if it were a question when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all is when you've got something
really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well
without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand
up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw." The "we" is high, the "aw" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this
in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all
about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage
in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were
actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world
that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding
would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Did you ever notice how many
jokes start with, "Did you ever notice?" And what's the deal with, 
"What's the deal?" There's a lot of funny to be found by simply noticing the ordinary, 
everyday things you don't ordinarily notice everyday. So if you'd like to add a little humor to that story, or speech, 
or screenplay you're writing, here are a few tips and tricks
for finding the funny. All great storytelling, 
including comedy writing, consists of a handful 
of basic ingredients: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Writers have been asking these questions
since at least the 1st century BC, yet none can be answered 
with a simple yes or no. They demand details, and the more specific the details,
the funnier the story. Let's start with the who,
the comedic character. Think about the books, TV shows,
and movies that make you laugh. They're usually filled with funny types,
or archetypes. The know-it-all, the loveable loser, the bad boss, the neurotic, the airhead. Incidentally, these are all stock 
characters found in Commedia Dell'Arte, or the artists comedy 
of late Renaissance Italy, and they have yet to get old. The Commedia rule for creating comic 
characters is find the flaw, then play it up. Or you can try playing with opposites. When the smartest guy in the room
does the stupidest thing, or the doofus outwits the brainiac, we tend to laugh because
we didn't see that coming. Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle
is said to have said, "The secret to humor is surprise." This surprise, 
or incongruity theory of humor, says we laugh at things 
that seem out of place or run up against our expectations, like a frog dating a pig, or a lizard selling insurance, a baby disco dancing, a nun disco dancing, a cat disco dancing. Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat
doing pretty much anything, especially involving disco. One fun way to find incongruities
is by drawing connections. Actually drawing them with a mind map. Start small. Pick a word, I choose pickle. Jot it down, then quick as you can,
try making connections. What do pickles make me think of? Who eats pickles? What treasured pickle memories
do I have from childhood? Another great way to generate
comedic material is to shift from observation
to imagination. Try going from "what is"
to "what if?" Like, what if instead of a horse,
for example, you just had a pair of coconuts? Okay, let's think of some other
memorable moments in history, literature, or film. Now, what if they featured coconuts? Get wild, let it go. Even if an idea seems overdone, or too obvious, or just plain dumb, try jotting it down, anyway. What's obvious to you
may not be to the next person. And the opposite of the dumbest idea
might just turn out to be the smartest. What about all that dumb stuff
that happens in real life? Have you ever noticed how much comedy
revolves around things that irritate, frustrate, 
and humiliate us? Will Rodgers said, "Everything's funny
as long as it happens to somebody else." So if you're having a crummy morning, imagine it happening to a character
you're writing about, and by afternoon, you may at least
get a funny story out of it. Once you've got your characters
and story, here are a few quick and easy comedy
writing tricks to make them zing. The rule of three, or zig zig zag. Try setting up an expected pattern,
zig zig, then flip it, zag. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a bar. The punchline rule says put your punch
at the end of the line. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a disco. That brings up the rule of K. For some reason, words with a k-sound
catch our ears and are considered comical. Coconut, disco, pickles, crickets? Okay, so we don't always get the laugh. Humor is subjective. Comedy is trial and error. Writing is rewriting. Just keep trying. Find the flaws, discover the details, insert incongruities, incorporate k-words, and remember the most important rule
of writing funny: have fun. As Charles Dickins said, "There is nothing in the world so
irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor." And disco.

is said to have said, "The secret to humor is surprise." This surprise, 
or incongruity theory of humor, says we laugh at things 
that seem out of place or run up against our expectations, like a frog dating a pig, or a lizard selling insurance, a baby disco dancing, a nun disco dancing, a cat disco dancing. Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat
doing pretty much anything, especially involving disco. One fun way to find incongruities
is by drawing connections. Actually drawing them with a mind map. Start small. Pick a word, I choose pickle. Jot it down, then quick as you can,
try making connections. What do pickles make me think of? Who eats pickles? What treasured pickle memories
do I have from childhood? Another great way to generate
comedic material is to shift from observation
to imagination. Try going from "what is"
to "what if?" Like, what if instead of a horse,
for example, you just had a pair of coconuts? Okay, let's think of some other
memorable moments in history, literature, or film. Now, what if they featured coconuts? Get wild, let it go. Even if an idea seems overdone, or too obvious, or just plain dumb, try jotting it down, anyway. What's obvious to you
may not be to the next person. And the opposite of the dumbest idea
might just turn out to be the smartest. What about all that dumb stuff
that happens in real life? Have you ever noticed how much comedy
revolves around things that irritate, frustrate, 
and humiliate us? Will Rodgers said, "Everything's funny
as long as it happens to somebody else." So if you're having a crummy morning, imagine it happening to a character
you're writing about, and by afternoon, you may at least
get a funny story out of it. Once you've got your characters
and story, here are a few quick and easy comedy
writing tricks to make them zing. The rule of three, or zig zig zag. Try setting up an expected pattern,
zig zig, then flip it, zag. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a bar. The punchline rule says put your punch
at the end of the line. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut
walk into a disco. That brings up the rule of K. For some reason, words with a k-sound
catch our ears and are considered comical. Coconut, disco, pickles, crickets? Okay, so we don't always get the laugh. Humor is subjective. Comedy is trial and error. Writing is rewriting. Just keep trying. Find the flaws, discover the details, insert incongruities, incorporate k-words, and remember the most important rule
of writing funny: have fun. As Charles Dickins said, "There is nothing in the world so
irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor." And disco.

**Transcript**:
Did you ever notice how many
jokes start with, "Did you ever notice?" And what's the deal with, 
"What's the deal?" There's a lot of funny to be found by simply noticing the ordinary, 
everyday things you don't ordinarily notice everyday. So if you'd like to add a little humor to that story, or speech, 
or screenplay you're writing, here are a few tips and tricks
for finding the funny. All great storytelling, 
including comedy writing, consists of a handful 
of basic ingredients: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Writers have been asking these questions
since at least the 1st century BC, yet none can be answered 
with a simple yes or no. They demand details, and the more specific the details,
the funnier the story. Let's start with the who,
the comedic character. Think about the books, TV shows,
and movies that make you laugh. They're usually filled with funny types,
or archetypes. The know-it-all, the loveable loser, the bad boss, the neurotic, the airhead. Incidentally, these are all stock 
characters found in Commedia Dell'Arte, or the artists comedy 
of late Renaissance Italy, and they have yet to get old. The Commedia rule for creating comic 
characters is find the flaw, then play it up. Or you can try playing with opposites. When the smartest guy in the room
does the stupidest thing, or the doofus outwits the brainiac, we tend to laugh because
we didn't see that coming. Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle

Imagine something small enough to float
on a particle of dust that holds the keys to understanding
cancer, virology, and genetics. Luckily for us, such a thing exists in the form 
of trillions upon trillions of human lab-grown cells
called HeLa. Let's take a step back for a second. Scientists grow human cells in the lab
to study how they function, understand how diseases develop, and test new treatments without
endangering patients. To make sure that they can repeat
these experiments over and over, and compare the results 
with other scientists, they need huge populations 
of identical cells that can duplicate themselves 
faithfully for years, but until 1951, all human cell lines
that researchers tried to grow had died after a few days. Then a John Hopkins scientist
named George Gey received a sample of 
a strange looking tumor: dark purple, shiny, jelly-like. This sample was special. Some of its cells just kept dividing, and dividing, and dividing. When individual cells died, generations of copies took their place
and thrived. The result was an endless source of
identical cells that's still around today. The very first immortal human cell line. Gey labeled it "HeLa" after the patient
with the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks. Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia, she lived in Baltimore with her husband
and five children. She died of aggressive cervical cancer a few months after her tumorous cells
were harvested, and she never knew about them. So what's so special about the cells
from Henrietta Lacks that lets them survive
when other cell lines die? The short answer is
we don't entirely know. Normal human cells have built-in
control mechanisms. They can divide about 50 times
before they self destruct in a process called apoptosis. This prevents the propagation
of genetic errors that creep in after 
repeated rounds of division. But cancer cells ignore these signals,
dividing indefinitely and crowding out normal cells. Still, most cell lines eventually die off,
especially outside the human body. Not HeLa, though, and that's the part
we can't yet explain. Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had
the first immortal line of human cells, he sent samples 
to labs all over the world. Soon the world's first 
cell production facility was churning out 
6 trillion HeLa cells a week, and scientists put them to work
in an ethically problematic way, building careers and fortunes
off of Henrietta's cells without her or her family's consent,
or even knowledge until decades later. The polio epidemic was at its peak
in the early 50s. HeLa cells, which easily took up
and replicated the virus, allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine. They've been used to study diseases, including measles, mumps, HIV, and ebola. We know that human 
cells have 46 chromosomes because a scientist working with HeLa
discovered a chemcial that makes chromosomes visible. HeLa cells themselves actually have
around 80 highly mutated chromosomes. HeLa cells were the first to be cloned. They've traveled to outer space. Telomerase, an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade
destruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical
cancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled
thousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher
than anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they 
can travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells 
and taking over like weeds, countless cures, patents and discoveries
all made thanks to Henrieta Lacks.

**Transcript**:
Imagine something small enough to float
on a particle of dust that holds the keys to understanding
cancer, virology, and genetics. Luckily for us, such a thing exists in the form 
of trillions upon trillions of human lab-grown cells
called HeLa. Let's take a step back for a second. Scientists grow human cells in the lab
to study how they function, understand how diseases develop, and test new treatments without
endangering patients. To make sure that they can repeat
these experiments over and over, and compare the results 
with other scientists, they need huge populations 
of identical cells that can duplicate themselves 
faithfully for years, but until 1951, all human cell lines
that researchers tried to grow had died after a few days. Then a John Hopkins scientist
named George Gey received a sample of 
a strange looking tumor: dark purple, shiny, jelly-like. This sample was special. Some of its cells just kept dividing, and dividing, and dividing. When individual cells died, generations of copies took their place
and thrived. The result was an endless source of
identical cells that's still around today. The very first immortal human cell line. Gey labeled it "HeLa" after the patient
with the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks. Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia, she lived in Baltimore with her husband
and five children. She died of aggressive cervical cancer a few months after her tumorous cells
were harvested, and she never knew about them. So what's so special about the cells
from Henrietta Lacks that lets them survive
when other cell lines die? The short answer is
we don't entirely know. Normal human cells have built-in
control mechanisms. They can divide about 50 times
before they self destruct in a process called apoptosis. This prevents the propagation
of genetic errors that creep in after 
repeated rounds of division. But cancer cells ignore these signals,
dividing indefinitely and crowding out normal cells. Still, most cell lines eventually die off,
especially outside the human body. Not HeLa, though, and that's the part
we can't yet explain. Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had
the first immortal line of human cells, he sent samples 
to labs all over the world. Soon the world's first 
cell production facility was churning out 
6 trillion HeLa cells a week, and scientists put them to work
in an ethically problematic way, building careers and fortunes
off of Henrietta's cells without her or her family's consent,
or even knowledge until decades later. The polio epidemic was at its peak
in the early 50s. HeLa cells, which easily took up
and replicated the virus, allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine. They've been used to study diseases, including measles, mumps, HIV, and ebola. We know that human 
cells have 46 chromosomes because a scientist working with HeLa
discovered a chemcial that makes chromosomes visible. HeLa cells themselves actually have
around 80 highly mutated chromosomes. HeLa cells were the first to be cloned. They've traveled to outer space. Telomerase, an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade
destruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical
cancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled
thousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher
than anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they 
can travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells 
and taking over like weeds, countless cures, patents and discoveries
all made thanks to Henrieta Lacks.

**Transcript**:
There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together, when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives. But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land, and became central in many rituals
and traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds. Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged
on the tree for decades. Cones that fall to the ground
can be viable for several years, as well. But when temperatures get high enough,
the cones pop open. Let's see that in action. Once it's gotten started,
a coniferous forest fire typically spreads something like this. Flames ravage the thick understory
provided by species like douglas fir, a shade-tolerant tree 
that's able to thrive under the canopy 
of lodgepole pines. The fire uses these smaller trees
as a step ladder to reach the higher canopy 
of old lodgepole pines. That ignites a tremendous crown fire reaching temperatures 
of up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's well more than the 115-140 degrees that signal the moment 
when serotinous seeds can be freed. At those temperatures,
the cones burst open, releasing millions of seeds, which are carried by the hot air
to form new forests. After the fire, carbon-rich soils
and an open sunlit landscape help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly
and sprout in abundance. From the death of the old forest
comes the birth of the new. Fires are also important
for the wider ecosystem as a whole. Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,
key forest species would disappear, and so would the many creatures
that depend on them. And if a fire-dependent forest
goes too long without burning, that raises the risk 
of a catastrophic blaze, which could destroy a forest completely, not to mention people's homes and lives. That's why forest rangers sometimes
intentionally start controlled burns to reduce fuels in order to keep
the more dangerous wildfires at bay. They may be frightening
and destructive forces of nature, but wildfires are also vital to the existence of healthy 
boreal forest ecosystems. By coming to terms with that, we can protect ourselves from their
more damaging effects while enabling the forests,
like the legendary phoenix, to rise reborn from their own ashes.

**Transcript**:
There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together, when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives. But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land, and became central in many rituals
and traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds. Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged

You've found the hidden switches, evaded the secret traps, and now your expedition finally stands at the heart of the ancient temple
inside The Lost City. But as you study the inscriptions
in the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students
accompanying you bump into the alter. Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke
burst forth and the walls begin to shake. Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before
with five hallways, including the one to the altar
and the one leading back outside. The giant sandglass in the center
is now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't 
want to be around when that happens. From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach
the exit at a fast pace. You know this is the last junction
before the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way. If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four
halls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making 
a run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told 
of the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen
possessing intruders and leading them to their doom
through deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students
have been cursed. At any time, 
one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse
didn't get you, but you don't know which students
can't be trusted, and because the possessed students
may lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test
them to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure
that you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects
their communication. Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since
you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students 
for the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two
of the paths won't work because if one group came back split
two versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair
and two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie,
or they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will 
always tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give
the same report or argue about 
whether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, 
you can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence
about three of the four paths. The fourth you can figure out
using the process of elimination. Of course, none of this matters if you're
lucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together
leaves you with three possibilities. If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students 
are paired together. In either case, ignore the duo. If there's only one group arguing,
both others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students
are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority
in both trios since at least two people in each
will be truthful. The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors 
escape from two of the students. You're all safe and free from the curse. After that ordeal, you tell your group 
they all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have
another expedition coming up.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Would seven expeditioners have been enough if both liars definitely will lie about whether they find the exit?
Options: A. No, then some pair of paths would have been explored by four people or fewer and that’s not enough if there are two liars in the group, B. No, no odd number will work, C. Yes
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why did the professor decide to split the eight students into one pair and two trios to explore the remaining three paths?

halls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making 
a run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told 
of the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen
possessing intruders and leading them to their doom
through deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students
have been cursed. At any time, 
one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse
didn't get you, but you don't know which students
can't be trusted, and because the possessed students
may lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test
them to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure
that you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects
their communication. Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since
you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students 
for the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two
of the paths won't work because if one group came back split
two versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair
and two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie,
or they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will 
always tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give
the same report or argue about 
whether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, 
you can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence
about three of the four paths. The fourth you can figure out
using the process of elimination. Of course, none of this matters if you're
lucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together
leaves you with three possibilities. If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students 
are paired together. In either case, ignore the duo. If there's only one group arguing,
both others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students
are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority
in both trios since at least two people in each
will be truthful. The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors 
escape from two of the students. You're all safe and free from the curse. After that ordeal, you tell your group 
they all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have
another expedition coming up.

**Transcript**:
The epic poem "La Dragontea" describes how English explorer
Sir Francis Drake sailed across the Gulf of Venezuela
in 1595. He was aiming for
the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish 
about his approach. Lake Maracaibo is 
the stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water
at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges that steadily build
up inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds
and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year, averaging out to 11 strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer on account of the Sun providing
more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge
down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet— a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas.

in 1595. He was aiming for
the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish 
about his approach. Lake Maracaibo is 
the stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water
at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges that steadily build
up inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds
and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year, averaging out to 11 strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer on account of the Sun providing
more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge
down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet— a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas.

**Transcript**:
Would you like to know 
what's in our future? What's going to happen tomorrow,
next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries
to industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people
called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this
with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as
the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists
and futurists who together forecast 
many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up
research material for the reader. One way futurists arrive
at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends
in society, and charting the paths they are likely
to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions
of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh 
options for the future that otherwise could not have 
been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how
certain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable 
discoveries that arise which would make no sense
to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist 
from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material
exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough
energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. "How can such energy come from nowhere?"
he would demand to know. "That's not science, that's magic." And for all intents and purposes,
he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity
or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future
could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic." How can we prepare, then, for a future
that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone
from the 19th century? We may think our modern technology
and advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future
with much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it's also true that our 
technological progress has brought with it new increasingly 
complex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to
be able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been
with us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation 
for our modern world. During this time of explosive development
and invention, a new form of literature, science fiction,
also emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day,
Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored
fantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century
and into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their
visions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects
of the world we inhabit decades later. In "Brave New World," Aldous Huxley foretold 
the use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication 
became popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
forecast earbuds, "thimble radios," in his words. And in "2001: A Space Odyssey," Arthur C. Clarke described a portable,
flat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment
and social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief
and consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar 
and deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills 
the words of philosopher Michel Foucault, "I'm no prophet. My job is making windows
where there were once walls." Free from the constraints of the present
and our assumptions of what's impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool
for thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ
science fictions writers in their teams. Just recently, a project called iKnow
proposed scenarios that look much 
like science fiction stories. They include the discovery of
an alien civilization, development of a way for humans
and animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can't know for certain, but science fiction 
shows us many possibilities. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to determine which 
we will work towards making a reality.

is indistinguishable from magic." How can we prepare, then, for a future
that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone
from the 19th century? We may think our modern technology
and advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future
with much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it's also true that our 
technological progress has brought with it new increasingly 
complex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to
be able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been
with us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation 
for our modern world. During this time of explosive development
and invention, a new form of literature, science fiction,
also emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day,
Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored
fantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century
and into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their
visions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects
of the world we inhabit decades later. In "Brave New World," Aldous Huxley foretold 
the use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication 
became popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451,"
forecast earbuds, "thimble radios," in his words. And in "2001: A Space Odyssey," Arthur C. Clarke described a portable,
flat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment
and social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief
and consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar 
and deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills 
the words of philosopher Michel Foucault, "I'm no prophet. My job is making windows
where there were once walls." Free from the constraints of the present
and our assumptions of what's impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool
for thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ
science fictions writers in their teams. Just recently, a project called iKnow
proposed scenarios that look much 
like science fiction stories. They include the discovery of
an alien civilization, development of a way for humans
and animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can't know for certain, but science fiction 
shows us many possibilities. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to determine which 
we will work towards making a reality.

**Transcript**:
Would you like to know 
what's in our future? What's going to happen tomorrow,
next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries
to industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people
called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this
with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as
the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists
and futurists who together forecast 
many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up
research material for the reader. One way futurists arrive
at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends
in society, and charting the paths they are likely
to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions
of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh 
options for the future that otherwise could not have 
been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how
certain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable 
discoveries that arise which would make no sense
to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist 
from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material
exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough
energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. "How can such energy come from nowhere?"
he would demand to know. "That's not science, that's magic." And for all intents and purposes,
he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity
or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future
could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic." How can we prepare, then, for a future
that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone
from the 19th century? We may think our modern technology

**Transcript**:
Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns
mirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry
is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells'
always coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up
their trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body
looks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs 
are arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas
lie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver
are on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes,
and the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar,
but function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed
the right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped,
a condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical
on the right and left. One theory focuses 
on a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs
called cilia, while tilt away from the head
and whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid
from the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes
on the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells
to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo
are chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually
translated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube
along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo 
is around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards 
the right side of the body. It grows different 
structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar
asymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs
emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,
don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be 
intrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches
that all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured 
inside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up 
like the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many 
of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,
are inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control 
which way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules 
have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule 
and its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, 
they look the same, but trying to put your right
in your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level
is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns
mirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry
is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells'
always coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up
their trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body
looks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs 
are arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas
lie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver
are on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes,
and the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar,
but function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed
the right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped,
a condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical
on the right and left. One theory focuses 
on a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs
called cilia, while tilt away from the head
and whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid
from the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes
on the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells
to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo
are chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually
translated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube
along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo 
is around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards 
the right side of the body. It grows different 
structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar
asymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs
emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,
don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be 
intrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches
that all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured 
inside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up 
like the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many 
of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,
are inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control 
which way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules 
have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule 
and its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, 
they look the same, but trying to put your right
in your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level
is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections.

**Transcript**:
About 66 million years ago, something terrible happened
to life on our planet. Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening 
all around us today. Environments change, pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities
for others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives. And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record, where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned, some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment, creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods 
have become so effective that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today
as environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact
on the world from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
About 66 million years ago, something terrible happened
to life on our planet. Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening 
all around us today. Environments change, pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities
for others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives. And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record, where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned, some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment, creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods 
have become so effective that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today
as environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact
on the world from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future.
