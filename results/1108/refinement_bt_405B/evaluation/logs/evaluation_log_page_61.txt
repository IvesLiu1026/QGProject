**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so the awesome story uh it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to Canada my mom left Nairobi Kenya my dad left a small village outside of amzar India and they got here in the late 1960s they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto and they settled into a new life uh they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger um and they had their first kids my sister and I grew up here um and we had quiet happy childhoods uh we had close family good friends and quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like um power always on in our houses uh things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard uh we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old girl is still part of you they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and SM smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a $20 bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last day is authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story um let's go all the way back to 1932 when on a Peanut Farm in Georgia a little baby boy named Rosevelt Greer was born Rosevelt Greer or Rosie Greer as people used to call him grew up and grew into a 300 lb 6'5 linebacker in the NFL he's number 76 in the picture here he is pictured with the Fearsome forsome these are four guys in the LA Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against they were a tough football players doing what they love which was you know crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field um but but Rosie Greer also had another passion um in his deep deeply authentic self he also loved needle point he loved he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying and help them meet chicks that's what he said I mean he loved it so much that after he retired from the NFL he started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so that they could sell it to us for 25 cents I said I don't believe that he's like I don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then I think you'll live a life that is Rich and is satisfying and I think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: What motivated the speaker to start the "1000 Awesome Things" blog?**

However, this question does not directly ask for the name of the blog. A more similar question would be one that directly asks for the name of the blog.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the name of the blog. But if I had to choose one that is related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

**Question 8: What is the name of the award won by the speaker for his blog?**

This question is related to the blog, but it asks for the name of the award, not the blog itself.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but the closest related question is Question 8. However, I must note that this is not a direct match.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that might include a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so the awesome story uh it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to Canada my mom left Nairobi Kenya my dad left a small village outside of amzar India and they got here in the late 1960s they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto and they settled into a new life uh they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger um and they had their first kids my sister and I grew up here um and we had quiet happy childhoods uh we had close family good friends and quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like um power always on in our houses uh things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard uh we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old girl is still part of you they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and SM smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a $20 bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last day is authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story um let's go all the way back to 1932 when on a Peanut Farm in Georgia a little baby boy named Rosevelt Greer was born Rosevelt Greer or Rosie Greer as people used to call him grew up and grew into a 300 lb 6'5 linebacker in the NFL he's number 76 in the picture here he is pictured with the Fearsome forsome these are four guys in the LA Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against they were a tough football players doing what they love which was you know crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field um but but Rosie Greer also had another passion um in his deep deeply authentic self he also loved needle point he loved he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying and help them meet chicks that's what he said I mean he loved it so much that after he retired from the NFL he started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so that they could sell it to us for 25 cents I said I don't believe that he's like I don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then I think you'll live a life that is Rich and is satisfying and I think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What is the first of the "Three A's" discussed by the speaker? Options: A. Authenticity, B. Awareness, C. Attitude, D. Appreciation**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks about the first "A" and not all three. But among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the closest match.

A more accurate match would be a question that asks about all three "A's" like the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **5**, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

To create a more accurate match, I would suggest generating a new question that asks about all three "A's", such as:

**Question: What are the three A's of Awesome? Options: A. Answers, Authenticity, and Acceptance, B. Attitude, Awesomeness, and Acceptance, C. Acceptance, Awesomeness, and Answers, D. Attitude, Awareness, and Authenticity**

This new question would be a more exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so that they could sell it to us for 25 cents I said I don't believe that he's like I don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then I think you'll live a life that is Rich and is satisfying and I think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so the awesome story uh it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to Canada my mom left Nairobi Kenya my dad left a small village outside of amzar India and they got here in the late 1960s they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto and they settled into a new life uh they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger um and they had their first kids my sister and I grew up here um and we had quiet happy childhoods uh we had close family good friends and quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like um power always on in our houses uh things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard uh we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old girl is still part of you they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and SM smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a $20 bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last day is authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story um let's go all the way back to 1932 when on a Peanut Farm in Georgia a little baby boy named Rosevelt Greer was born Rosevelt Greer or Rosie Greer as people used to call him grew up and grew into a 300 lb 6'5 linebacker in the NFL he's number 76 in the picture here he is pictured with the Fearsome forsome these are four guys in the LA Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against they were a tough football players doing what they love which was you know crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field um but but Rosie Greer also had another passion um in his deep deeply authentic self he also loved needle point he loved he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying and help them meet chicks that's what he said I mean he loved it so much that after he retired from the NFL he started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it

things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being

awesome thank you

**Transcript**:
you may have heard about the quran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real quranic idea of paradise defined 36 times as gardens watered by running streams since i live in a houseboat on the running stream of lake union this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who've begun reading the quran but given up disconcerted by its otherness the historian thomas carlisle considered muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes yet even he called the quran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearysome confused jumble part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the quran can be read as we usually read a book and so we can curl up with it on this rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as the god and the quran is alien the voice of god speaking to muhammad we're just another author on the bestseller list yet the fact that so few people do actually read the quran is precisely why it's so easy to quote that is to misquote phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti-muslim islamophobes so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the quran properly as properly as i could that is my arabics reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic now i did have an advantage my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the quran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the quran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else's holy book so i read slowly i'd set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it it turned out to be three months i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the quran that feeling of i get it now it is slip away overnight and i'd come back in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very familiar the quran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham moses joseph mary jesus god himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the air i spent wandering the sinai desert and then there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory and i began to grasp why it said that the quran is really the quran only in arabic take the fatiha the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord's prayer in the shmai's hail of islam combined it's just 29 words in arabic but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than red felt more than analyzed it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the quran in english is a kind of shadow of itself or as arthur aubry called his version an interpretation but all is not lost in translation as the quran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises a degree of environmental awareness for instance and of humans as

use but the truth is nobody really knows and that's the point because the quran is quite clear when it says that you will be a new creation in paradise and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin and that number 72 never appears there are no 72 virgins in the quran that idea only came into being 300 years later and most

you may have heard about the quran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real quranic idea of paradise defined 36 times as gardens watered by running streams since i live in a houseboat on the running stream of lake union this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who've begun reading the quran but given up disconcerted by its otherness the historian thomas carlisle considered muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes yet even he called the quran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearysome confused jumble part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the quran can be read as we usually read a book and so we can curl up with it on this rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as the god and the quran is alien the voice of god speaking to muhammad we're just another author on the bestseller list yet the fact that so few people do actually read the quran is precisely why it's so easy to quote that is to misquote phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti-muslim islamophobes so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the quran properly as properly as i could that is my arabics reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic now i did have an advantage my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the quran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the quran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else's holy book so i read slowly i'd set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it it turned out to be three months i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the quran that feeling of i get it now it is slip away overnight and i'd come back in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very familiar the quran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham moses joseph mary jesus god himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the air i spent wandering the sinai desert and then there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory and i began to grasp why it said that the quran is really the quran only in arabic take the fatiha the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord's prayer in the shmai's hail of islam combined it's just 29 words in arabic but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than red felt more than analyzed it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the quran in english is a kind of shadow of itself or as arthur aubry called his

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, the closest match can be identified based on the context and intent of the questions.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it took Lesley to read the Koran. Although none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 3 mentions the speaker's approach to reading the Quran and the fact that they initially set aside three weeks for the project, but it took longer.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ that can be linked to the time taken is not available. But if we were to choose one that is somewhat related to the reading process, it would be:

Question 3: How did the speaker approach reading the Quran to gain a deeper understanding?

However, please note that this is not a direct match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: 3 

However, I want to emphasize that this is not a direct match, and a more suitable generated MCQ that directly addresses the time taken to read the Quran is not available in the provided options.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of verses in the opening chapter of the Koran. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 1 does mention the opening chapter of the Koran (Fatiha) in the transcript. However, it does not ask about the number of verses.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 1, but with a note that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the number of verses in the opening chapter of the Koran.

However, since I need to provide an index, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that mentions the Fatiha (the opening chapter of the Koran).

the original arabic is that one word who is not a swelling breast or high prism inside now this may be a way of saying pure beings like in angels or it may be like the greek cross or koi and eternal use but the truth is nobody really knows and that's the point because the quran is quite clear when it says that you will be a new creation in paradise and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin and that number 72 never appears there are no 72 virgins in the quran that idea only came into being 300 years later and most

But the question that directly answers the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 1: According to the speaker, what is the Quranic idea of paradise? 
Options: A. A place with 72 virgins, B. Gardens watered by running streams, C. A location with camels and mountains, D. A city with a sacred sanctuary 
Correct Option: B

However, none of these questions directly asks how many times the number 72 appears in the Quran.

Since none of the questions directly matches the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that implies the answer to the ground truth MCQ.

The correct answer is the one that implies the number 72 does not appear in the Quran as a description of paradise.

**Transcript**:
you may have heard about the quran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real quranic idea of paradise defined 36 times as gardens watered by running streams since i live in a houseboat on the running stream of lake union this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who've begun reading the quran but given up disconcerted by its otherness the historian thomas carlisle considered muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes yet even he called the quran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearysome confused jumble part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the quran can be read as we usually read a book and so we can curl up with it on this rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as the god and the quran is alien the voice of god speaking to muhammad we're just another author on the bestseller list yet the fact that so few people do actually read the quran is precisely why it's so easy to quote that is to misquote phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti-muslim islamophobes so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the quran properly as properly as i could that is my arabics reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic now i did have an advantage my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the quran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the quran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else's holy book so i read slowly i'd set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it it turned out to be three months i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the quran that feeling of i get it now it is slip away overnight and i'd come back in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very familiar the quran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham moses joseph mary jesus god himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the air i spent wandering the sinai desert and then there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory and i began to grasp why it said that the quran is really the quran only in arabic take the fatiha the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord's prayer in the shmai's hail of islam combined it's just 29 words in arabic but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than red felt more than analyzed it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the quran in english is a kind of shadow of itself or as arthur aubry called his version an interpretation but all is not lost in translation as the quran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises a degree of environmental awareness for instance and of humans as mere stewards of god's creation unmatched in the bible and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men using the second and third person masculine the quran includes women talking for instance of believing men and believing women honorable men and honorable women or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers yes it does say that but in a very specific context the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca where fighting was usually forbidden and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must kill unbelievers in mecca but you can you are allowed to but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba and only if they attack you first and even then god is merciful

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Bewilder, to confuse or puzzle completely. The root of the word bewilder can be traced back to the Old English word wilde, which was used to refer to something that was in a natural state, uncultivated, or undomesticated. Over time, the word wild was often linked to the Old English word deor. Deor, which was derived from an early Indo-European root that meant breathe, was initially used to describe any untamed animal or beast. This eventually morphed into the modern word deer, meaning a ruminant of the family Cervidae. The two Old English words, when mashed together, became wilderness, meaning a tract of uncultivated land, primarily inhabited by undomesticated beasts. From the word wilderness, the word wilder was born. To wilder someone was to lead him astray or lure him into the woods. In the 1600's, the prefix be, meaning thoroughly, was compounded with wilder as a way of tacking on a little extra punch. Someone who was bewildered was thoroughly lost in the wild. From this winding background, bewilder eventually evolved into our current definition, to be completely confused.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What is the connection between the word "bewilder" and the concept of being lost in the wild? However, this is not an exact match.

A more suitable match would be a generated question that directly asks about the meaning of "to wilder someone." Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the available options, I would choose Question 2 as the closest match, as it discusses the meaning of the word "deor," which is related to the concept of being wild or undomesticated.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that best aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but it does not directly ask about the meaning of "to wilder someone."

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that discusses a related concept.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels and to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation 17 doesn't divide by two it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly temper started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had 18 camels the first son took his half half of 18 is nine the second son took his third a third of 18 is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of 18 is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like 17 camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel now finding that 18th camel in the world's conflict has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all 15 000 tribes are in touch with each other and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light there's a lot of conflict and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it's maybe our one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us it's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give you just a story an example about 20 years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time living with several groups of son bushmen i was curious about them about the way in which they resolved conflict because after all their within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives there's a cooling off period well that system is i think probably a system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it there's always two sides you know it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he went on and he turned to me and said you're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we're here to do just to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering in the bloodshed in chechnya the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict and the most impossible conflict is the middle east question is where's the third side there how could we possibly go to the balcony now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

[Music] [Music] well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels and to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation 17 doesn't divide by two it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly temper started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had 18 camels the first son took his half half of 18 is nine the second son took his third a third of 18 is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of 18 is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like 17 camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel now finding that 18th camel in the world's conflict has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all 15 000 tribes are in touch with each other and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light there's a lot of conflict and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it's maybe our one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us it's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give you just a story an example about 20 years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time living with several groups of son bushmen i was curious about them about the way in which they resolved conflict because after all their within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives there's a cooling off period well that system is i think probably a system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it there's always two sides you know it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he went on and he turned to me and said you're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we're here to do just to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering in the bloodshed in chechnya the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict and the most impossible conflict is the middle east question is where's the third side there how could we possibly go to the balcony now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels and to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation 17 doesn't divide by two it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly temper started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had 18 camels the first son took his half half of 18 is nine the second son took his third a third of 18 is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of 18 is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like 17 camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel now finding that 18th camel in the world's conflict has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all 15 000 tribes are in touch with each other and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light there's a lot of conflict and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it's maybe our one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us it's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give you just a story an example about 20 years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time living with several groups of son bushmen i was curious about them about the way in which they resolved conflict because after all their within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives there's a cooling off period well that system is i think probably a system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it there's always two sides you know it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he went on and he turned to me and said you're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we're here to do just to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering in the bloodshed in chechnya the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict and the most impossible conflict is the middle east question is where's the third side there how could we possibly go to the balcony now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent

Options: A. It highlights the consequences of violence and conflict, B. It emphasizes the importance of kindness towards strangers and unity, C. It promotes the idea of separate identities and division, D. It emphasizes the importance of strength and power 

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it asks about the importance of Abraham in the context of the Middle East, and the correct option (B) highlights Abraham's role in promoting unity and kindness towards strangers.

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks who the primary unifying figure and story of the Middle East is. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant worldclass neuropsychologist I had a baby and that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant world-class neuropsychologist sorry Ted uh but I did go on to be a reasonably astute arguably world-class worrier one of my girlfriends in graduate school Marie said Kim I figured it out it's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full disclosure I brought some pictures to share oh I'll just say [Laughter] July zip for safety water wings an inch of water and then finally all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain so uh you could get kind of a feel for this so my baby Vander is eight years old now and uh despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer he's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would I worry because this is what I do this is what I teach it's what I study it's what I treat and I know that kids get concussed every year in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell wrong but what is it that we're really talking about let's take a look all right starski and Hutch arguably yes uh so a car accident 40 miles an hour into a fixed barrier 35 G's a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face 58 G in case you missed it we'll look again so look to the right hand side of the screen what would you say how many G's close 72 would it be crazy to know know 103 G's the average concussive impact is 95 G's now when the kid on the right doesn't get up right we know they've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them the definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness it requires only a change in Consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear being more impulsive or hostile than usual so given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am how do I get any sleep at all cuz I know our brains are resilient they're designed to recover from an injury if God forbid any of us left here tonight and sustain concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college H peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free Baseline after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there their risk for third injury greater still and so on and here's the really alarming part we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries you guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL uh in a nutshell This research suggests that among retired HED NFL players with three or more career concussions the incidence of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population so you've all seen that New York Times you've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car from the driveway so I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday so uh how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can we 100 % guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what I've come up [Laughter] with if only my little boy's right there and he's like she's not kidding she's totally not kidding so uh in all seriousness should my kid play football should your kid play football I don't know but I do know there are three things you can do the first study up you have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today there are some great resources out there the CDC has a program heads up it's at cdc.gov heads up is specific to concussion and kids the second is a resource I'm personally really proud of we've just rolled this out in the last couple months co- kids with brain injury this is a great resource for student athletes teachers parents professionals athletic and coaching staff it's a great place to start if you have questions the second thing is speak up just two weeks ago a bill introduced by Senator Cales that would have required athletes kids under 18 to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee it died in large part because it lacked constituent buyin it lacked stakeholder traction now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support but I am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that speak up also with coaching staff ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what's the budget for protective equipment how old is it maybe offered to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear which brings us to suit up wear a helmet the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening recently one of my graduate students Tom Tom said Kim I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class and uh Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the GeForce of impact by half now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet Crusade right this epiphany of Tom's as it turns out it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education so should Vander play football I can't say no but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet like to the car or at school so whether athlete scholar overprotected kid neurotic mom or otherwise here's my baby Vander reminding you to mind your matter thank [Applause] [Music] you

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant worldclass neuropsychologist I had a baby and that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant world-class neuropsychologist sorry Ted uh but I did go on to be a reasonably astute arguably world-class worrier one of my girlfriends in graduate school Marie said Kim I figured it out it's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full disclosure I brought some pictures to share oh I'll just say [Laughter] July zip for safety water wings an inch of water and then finally all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain so uh you could get kind of a feel for this so my baby Vander is eight years old now and uh despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer he's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would I worry because this is what I do this is what I teach it's what I study it's what I treat and I know that kids get concussed every year in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell wrong but what is it that we're really talking about let's take a look all right starski and Hutch arguably yes uh so a car accident 40 miles an hour into a fixed barrier 35 G's a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face 58 G in case you missed it we'll look again so look to the right hand side of the screen what would you say how many G's close 72 would it be crazy to know know 103 G's the average concussive impact is 95 G's now when the kid on the right doesn't get up right we know they've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them the definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness it requires only a change in Consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear being more impulsive or hostile than usual so given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am how do I get any sleep at all cuz I know our brains are resilient they're designed to recover from an injury if God forbid any of us left here tonight and sustain concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college H peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free Baseline after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there their risk for third injury greater still and so on and here's the really alarming part we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries you guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL uh in a nutshell This research suggests that among retired HED NFL players with three or more career concussions the incidence of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population so you've all seen that New York Times you've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car from the driveway so I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday so uh how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can we 100 % guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what I've come up [Laughter] with if only my little boy's right there and he's like she's not kidding she's totally not kidding so uh in all seriousness should my kid play football should your kid play football I don't know but I do know there are three things you can do the first study up you have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today there are some great resources out there the CDC has a program heads up it's at cdc.gov heads up is specific to concussion and kids the second is a resource I'm personally really proud of we've just rolled this out in the last couple months co- kids with brain injury this is a great resource for student athletes teachers parents professionals athletic and coaching staff it's a great place to start if you have questions the second thing is speak up just two weeks ago a bill introduced by Senator Cales that would have required athletes kids under 18 to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee it died in large part because it lacked constituent buyin it lacked stakeholder traction now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support but I am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that speak up also with coaching staff ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what's the budget for protective equipment how old is it maybe offered to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear which brings us to suit up wear a helmet the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening recently one of my graduate students Tom Tom said Kim I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class and uh Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the GeForce of impact by half now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet Crusade right this epiphany of Tom's as it turns out it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education so should Vander play football I can't say no but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet like to the car or at school so whether athlete scholar overprotected kid neurotic mom or otherwise here's my baby Vander reminding you to mind your matter thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects. And by August 1957, the Soviet's successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7, the same rocket that would be used to launch Sputnik two months later. So, the scary thing about Sputnik was not the orbiting ball itself, but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city. Not wanting to fall too far behind, President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up its own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible. So, on December 6, 1957, excited people across the nation tuned in to watch the live broadcast as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off and crashed to the ground two seconds later. The Vanguard failure was a huge embarassment for the United States. Newspapers printed headlines like, "Flopnik" and "Kaputnik." And a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mockingly suggested that the U.S. should receive foreign aid for developing nations. Fortunately, the Army had been working on their own parallel project, The Explorer, which was successfully launched in January 1958, but the U.S. had barely managed to catch up before they were surpassed again as Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961. Almost a year passed and several more Soviet astronauts completed their missions before Project Mercury succeeded in making John Glenn the first American in orbit in February 1962. By this time, President Kennedy had realized that simply catching up to each Soviet advance a few months later wasn't going to cut it. The U.S. had to do something first, and in May 1961, a month after Gargarin's flight, he announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. They succeeded in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step on July 20, 1969. With both countries' next turning their attention to orbital space stations, there's no telling how much longer the space race could have gone on. But because of improving relations negotiated by Soviet Premier Leonid Breshnev and U.S. President Nixon, the U.S.S.R. and U.S. moved toward cooperation rather than competition. The successful joint mission, known as Apollo-Soyuz, in which an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft and the two crews met, shook hands, and exchanged gifts, marked the end of the space race in 1975. So, in the end, what was the point of this whole space race? Was it just a massive waste of time? Two major superpowers trying to outdo each other by pursuing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive, using resources that could have been better spent elsewhere? Well, sure, sort of, but the biggest benefits of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another. During the space race, funding for research and education, in general, increased dramatically, leading to many advances that may not have otherwise been made. Many NASA technologies developed for space are now widely used in civilian life, from memory foam in mattresses to freeze-dried food, to LEDs in cancer treatment. And, of course, the satellites that we rely on for our GPS and mobile phone signals would not have been there without the space program. All of which goes to show that the rewards of scientific research and advancement are often far more vast than even the people pursuing them can imagine.

**Transcript**:
On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects. And by August 1957, the Soviet's successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7, the same rocket that would be used to launch Sputnik two months later. So, the scary thing about Sputnik was not the orbiting ball itself, but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city. Not wanting to fall too far behind, President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up its own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible. So, on December 6, 1957, excited people across the nation tuned in to watch the live broadcast as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off and crashed to the ground two seconds later. The Vanguard failure was a huge embarassment for the United States. Newspapers printed headlines like, "Flopnik" and "Kaputnik." And a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mockingly suggested that the U.S. should receive foreign aid for developing nations. Fortunately, the Army had been working on their own parallel project, The Explorer, which was successfully launched in January 1958, but the U.S. had barely managed to catch up before they were surpassed again as Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961. Almost a year passed and several more Soviet astronauts completed their missions before Project Mercury succeeded in making John Glenn the first American in orbit in February 1962. By this time, President Kennedy had realized that simply catching up to each Soviet advance a few months later wasn't going to cut it. The U.S. had to do something first, and in May 1961, a month after Gargarin's flight, he announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. They succeeded in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step on July 20, 1969. With both countries' next turning their attention to orbital space stations, there's no telling how much longer the space race could have gone on. But because of improving relations negotiated by Soviet Premier Leonid Breshnev and U.S. President Nixon, the U.S.S.R. and U.S. moved toward cooperation rather than competition. The successful joint mission, known as Apollo-Soyuz, in which an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft and the two crews met, shook hands, and exchanged gifts, marked the end of the space race in 1975. So, in the end, what was the point of this whole space race? Was it just a massive waste of time? Two major superpowers trying to outdo each other by pursuing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive, using resources that could have been better spent elsewhere? Well, sure, sort of, but the biggest benefits of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another. During the space race, funding for research and education, in general, increased dramatically, leading to many advances that may not have otherwise been made. Many NASA technologies developed for space are now widely used in civilian life, from memory foam in mattresses to freeze-dried food, to LEDs in cancer treatment. And, of course, the satellites that we rely on for our GPS and mobile phone signals would not have been there without the space program. All of which goes to show that the rewards of scientific research and advancement are often far more vast than even the people pursuing them can imagine.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar.

Although Question 8 does not ask about the president during the Sputnik launch, it does mention President Kennedy and his announcement in May 1961. This is the closest match in terms of presidential involvement, but it still does not directly address the question of who was the president during the Sputnik launch.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but with a note that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You can think of your cells as the kitchen in a busy restaurant. Sometimes your body orders chicken. Other times, it orders steak. Your cells have to be able to crank out whatever the body needs and quickly. When an order comes in, the chef looks to the cookbook, your DNA, for the recipe. She then transcribes that message onto a piece of paper called RNA and brings it back to her countertop, the ribosome. There, she can translate the recipe into a meal, or for your cells, a protein, by following the directions that she's copied down. But RNA does more for the cell than just act as a messenger between a cook and her cookbook. It can move in reverse and create DNA, it can direct amino acids to their targets, or it can take part in RNA interference, or RNAi. But wait! Why would RNA want to interfere with itself? Well, sometimes a cell doesn't want to turn all of the messenger RNA it creates into protein, or it may need to destroy RNA injected into the cell by an attacking virus. Say, for example, in our cellular kitchen, that someone wanted to cancel their order or decided they wanted chips instead of fries. That's where RNAi comes in. Thankfully, your cells have the perfect knives for just this kind of job. When the cell finds or produces long, double-stranded RNA molecules, it chops these molecules up with a protein actually named dicer. Now, these short snippets of RNA are floating around in the cell, and they're picked up by something called RISC, the RNA Silencing Complex. It's composed of a few different proteins, the most important being slicer. This is another aptly named protein, and we'll get to why in just a second. RISC strips these small chunks of double-stranded RNA in half, using the single strand to target matching mRNA, looking for pieces that fit together like two halves of a sandwich. When it finds the matching piece of mRNA, RISC's slicer protein slices it up. The cell then realizes there are odd, strangely sized pieces of RNA floating around and destroys them, preventing the mRNA from being turned into protein. So, you have double-stranded RNA, you dice it up, it targets mRNA, and then that gets sliced up, too. Voila! You've prevented expression and saved yourself some unhappy diners. So, how did anybody ever figure this out? Well, the process was first discovered in petunias when botanists trying to create deep purple blooms introduced a pigment-producing gene into the flowers. But instead of darker flowers, they found flowers with white patches and no pigment at all. Instead of using the RNA produced by the new gene to create more pigment, the flowers were actually using it to knock down the pigment-producing pathway, destroying RNA from the plant's original genes with RNAi, and leaving them with pigment-free white flowers. Scientists saw a similar phenomena in tiny worms called C. elegans, and once they figured out what was happening, they realized they could use RNAi to their advantage. Want to see what happens when a certain gene is knocked out of a worm or a fly? Introduce an RNAi construct for that gene, and bam! No more protein expression. You can even get creative and target that effect to certain systems, knocking down genes in just the brain, or just the liver, or just the heart. Figuring out what happens when you knock down a gene in a certain system can be an important step in figuring out what that gene does. But RNAi isn't just for understanding how things happen. It can also be a powerful, therapeutic tool and could be a way for us to manipulate what is happening within own cells. Researchers have been experimenting with using it to their advantage in medicine, including targeting RNA and tumor cells in the hopes of turning off cancer-causing genes. In theory, our cellular kitchens could serve up an order of cells, hold the cancer.

**Transcript**:
You can think of your cells as the kitchen in a busy restaurant. Sometimes your body orders chicken. Other times, it orders steak. Your cells have to be able to crank out whatever the body needs and quickly. When an order comes in, the chef looks to the cookbook, your DNA, for the recipe. She then transcribes that message onto a piece of paper called RNA and brings it back to her countertop, the ribosome. There, she can translate the recipe into a meal, or for your cells, a protein, by following the directions that she's copied down. But RNA does more for the cell than just act as a messenger between a cook and her cookbook. It can move in reverse and create DNA, it can direct amino acids to their targets, or it can take part in RNA interference, or RNAi. But wait! Why would RNA want to interfere with itself? Well, sometimes a cell doesn't want to turn all of the messenger RNA it creates into protein, or it may need to destroy RNA injected into the cell by an attacking virus. Say, for example, in our cellular kitchen, that someone wanted to cancel their order or decided they wanted chips instead of fries. That's where RNAi comes in. Thankfully, your cells have the perfect knives for just this kind of job. When the cell finds or produces long, double-stranded RNA molecules, it chops these molecules up with a protein actually named dicer. Now, these short snippets of RNA are floating around in the cell, and they're picked up by something called RISC, the RNA Silencing Complex. It's composed of a few different proteins, the most important being slicer. This is another aptly named protein, and we'll get to why in just a second. RISC strips these small chunks of double-stranded RNA in half, using the single strand to target matching mRNA, looking for pieces that fit together like two halves of a sandwich. When it finds the matching piece of mRNA, RISC's slicer protein slices it up. The cell then realizes there are odd, strangely sized pieces of RNA floating around and destroys them, preventing the mRNA from being turned into protein. So, you have double-stranded RNA, you dice it up, it targets mRNA, and then that gets sliced up, too. Voila! You've prevented expression and saved yourself some unhappy diners. So, how did anybody ever figure this out? Well, the process was first discovered in petunias when botanists trying to create deep purple blooms introduced a pigment-producing gene into the flowers. But instead of darker flowers, they found flowers with white patches and no pigment at all. Instead of using the RNA produced by the new gene to create more pigment, the flowers were actually using it to knock down the pigment-producing pathway, destroying RNA from the plant's original genes with RNAi, and leaving them with pigment-free white flowers. Scientists saw a similar phenomena in tiny worms called C. elegans, and once they figured out what was happening, they realized they could use RNAi to their advantage. Want to see what happens when a certain gene is knocked out of a worm or a fly? Introduce an RNAi construct for that gene, and bam! No more protein expression. You can even get creative and target that effect to certain systems, knocking down genes in just the brain, or just the liver, or just the heart. Figuring out what happens when you knock down a gene in a certain system can be an important step in figuring out what that gene does. But RNAi isn't just for understanding how things happen. It can also be a powerful, therapeutic tool and could be a way for us to manipulate what is happening within own cells. Researchers have been experimenting with using it to their advantage in medicine, including targeting RNA and tumor cells in the hopes of turning off cancer-causing genes. In theory, our cellular kitchens could serve up an order of cells, hold the cancer.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] we are here today because United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries they're called Millennium Development Goals and the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them and by specifying eight different goals the United Nations have said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get a good life for people look here you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspects from aid to trade there's a second reason I like these Development Goals and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality the aim here is to reduce child mortality with two thirds from 1990 to 2050 that's a 4% reduction per year and this with measuring that's what make the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people and what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia in Middle East in Latin America and East Europe that is reducing with this rate and even my T Brazil is going down with 5% per year and Turkey with 7% per year so there's good news but then I hear people saying there is no progress in Africa and there's not even statistics in Africa to know what is happening I'll prove them wrong on both points come with me to the wonderful world of statistic I bring you to the webpage child mortality dot or you know where you can bag deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it's done by UN specialists you know and I will take Kenya as an example here you see the data don't panic now don't panic you know I'll help you through this it looks you know nasty like in in in college when you did like statistics man but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself from where do the date that come what is the origin of the data is it so that in Kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of a child and it's sent to the Statistical Office no low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization it exists but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family and it's not registered so what we rely on is not incomplete system we have interviews we have surveys and in this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and Oscar about birth history how many children did you have order you're alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what you used to be called a demographic Health Survey report but these surveys are costly so they can only be done with three to five years interval but they have good quality so this is this is a limitation and all these colored lines here are results each color is one serving but that's too complicated for today so I'll simplified for you and I give you one average point for each survey this was 1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when the expert in the UN have got these service in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and trend line and the trend line looks like this see here is the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing and they estimated that 2008 Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I was sad because we could see this this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic but in June I got the mail in my inbox from demographic Health Survey and it showed good news from Kenya I was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey then it just took another three months for you and to get it into their server and on Friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn't it nice isn't it nice yeah I was actually on Friday sitting in front of my computer and I saw that the death rate fall from 128 to 84 yes that morning you know so we celebrated but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress I'm going into some details here because you n do it like this they start 1992 they measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no progress that's unfair as a professor I think I have the right to propose something differently I would say at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend it's to two surveys and you can see what's happening now they have 2.4 percent had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya I may have joined these two points so what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality we have a decent trend it coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs and the reason here for Africa is especially important because 90s was a bad decade not only in Kenya but across Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was resistant for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got late to the mosquito netting and there were socio-economic problems which are now being solved at the much better scale so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub-saharan Africa and UN says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent now this sounds a little theoretical but it's not so theoretically you know these economists they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of economy we in public health we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it's sort of the same percentage if your economy grow with 4% you ought to reduce child mortality with 4% if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want so so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years and economists would never do that I have just divided into two period in the 90s only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent whereas now second gear is like Africa had first gear now they go into second gear but even this is not a fair representation of Africa because it's an average it's an average speed of reduction in Africa and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs still here child F per 1000 on that axis here we have year and I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries I give you Congo which was high Ghana lower and Kenya even lower and what has happened over the years since there here we go you can see with independence literacy improved you know and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene was improved and things got better but then in the eighties watch out here Congo got into civil war and they leveled off fear Ghana got very help fast this was the backlash in Kenya and go on a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down together still the standstill in Congo that's why we are today you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this serie improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one place that their countries are so different and they married to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about Europe as one place I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different everyone knows that and they are judged each country on how they are doing you know so so let me show the why the picture my country Sweden 1800 we were up there what the strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate it's very strange it's sort of embarrassing but we had that habit in Sweden you know that we counted all the child that's even if we didn't do anything about it and then you see these are famine years this was bad years and people got fed up with freedom my ancestors moved to the United States you know and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service and child mortality came though we never had a war Sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary school actually starting 1842 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later you have to realise that the investments we do in progress for long term investments is not about just five years it's long term investments and and and Sweden never reach Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1 percent when I calculate so we are off track that was Sweden is but you don't talk about it so much you know we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you Thailand see what a success story in Thailand from the 1960s how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels of Sweden and I'll give you another story Egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health he just was up here 1960 higher than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease you know and and malaria and a lot of problem and then they got the Aswan Dam they got electricity in the homes the increased education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible and the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did as it fastest you know Kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill now let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality I'm going to show you the relation between child mortality on this axis here this here is child mortality and here I have the family size the relation between child mortality and family size one two three four children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see the continent the dark blue here is sub-saharan Africa you know and the size of the bubble is the population and these are the so called developing countries they had high or very high child mortality and family size six to eight and and and the ones over there they were the so called Western countries they had low child mortality and small families what has happened what I want you now is to see with your own eyes the relation between falling child mortality and decrease in family size I just want not have any ruby has to see that for yourself this is what happened now I start the world here we come down with their educational smallpox better education you know health service it got on there China comes Indian to the Western box here you know and here Brazil is in the west of all India's approach' the first African countries coming into the Western ball and we get a lot of new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down here this is the vision we have isn't it and look now the African the first African countries here are coming in there we are today there is no such thing as a Western world and developing world this is the this is the report from UN which came out on Friday it's very good levels and Friends and child mortality except this page this page is very bad it's the categorization of countries it labels developing countries I can read from the listed developing countries Republic of Korea South Korea now they get some some how can they be developing countries they have here Singapore that the lowest child mortality in the world is Singapore they bypass Sweden and five years ago and they are label developing country they have here guitar it's a richest country in the world with aljazeera how the heck could they be developing this is crap the rest there is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fit to the data you know and we have to realize that we are all going to live into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look even if we look in Africa these are the African countries you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size even within Africa it's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health metrics and evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50% of the fallen child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we got get girls in school we will get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong that's why we must have that long-term perspective but we must measure the impact over ten years period it's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down into the corner why we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter or actor most important from humanitarian aspects it's a decent life for children we are talking about but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population let's be clear about that and the way to do that that is to get child mortality down get access to family planning and behind that a drive of female education and that is fully possible let's do it thank you very much you [Music]

have to realize that we are all going to live into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look even if we look in Africa these are the African countries you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size even within Africa it's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health metrics and evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50% of the fallen child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we got get girls in school we will get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong that's why we must have that long-term perspective but we must measure the impact over ten years period it's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down into the corner why we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter or actor most important from humanitarian aspects it's a decent life for children we are talking about but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population let's be clear about that and the way to do that that is to get child mortality

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] we are here today because United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries they're called Millennium Development Goals and the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them and by specifying eight different goals the United Nations have said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get a good life for people look here you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspects from aid to trade there's a second reason I like these Development Goals and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality the aim here is to reduce child mortality with two thirds from 1990 to 2050 that's a 4% reduction per year and this with measuring that's what make the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people and what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia in Middle East in Latin America and East Europe that is reducing with this rate and even my T Brazil is going down with 5% per year and Turkey with 7% per year so there's good news but then I hear people saying there is no progress in Africa and there's not even statistics in Africa to know what is happening I'll prove them wrong on both points come with me to the wonderful world of statistic I bring you to the webpage child mortality dot or you know where you can bag deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it's done by UN specialists you know and I will take Kenya as an example here you see the data don't panic now don't panic you know I'll help you through this it looks you know nasty like in in in college when you did like statistics man but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself from where do the date that come what is the origin of the data is it so that in Kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of a child and it's sent to the Statistical Office no low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization it exists but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family and it's not registered so what we rely on is not incomplete system we have interviews we have surveys and in this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and Oscar about birth history how many children did you have order you're alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what you used to be called a demographic Health Survey report but these surveys are costly so they can only be done with three to five years interval but they have good quality so this is this is a limitation and all these colored lines here are results each color is one serving but that's too complicated for today so I'll simplified for you and I give you one average point for each survey this was 1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when the expert in the UN have got these service in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and trend line and the trend line looks like this see here is the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing and they estimated that 2008 Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I was sad because we could see this this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic but in June I got the mail in my inbox from demographic Health Survey and it showed good news from Kenya I was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey then it just took another three months for you and to get it into their server and on Friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn't it nice isn't it nice yeah I was actually on Friday sitting in front of my computer and I saw that the death rate fall from 128 to 84 yes that morning you know so we celebrated but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress I'm going into some details here because you n do it like this they start 1992 they measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no progress that's unfair as a professor I think I have the right to propose something differently I would say at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend it's to two surveys and you can see what's happening now they have 2.4 percent had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya I may have joined these two points so what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality we have a decent trend it coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs and the reason here for Africa is especially important because 90s was a bad decade not only in Kenya but across Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was resistant for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got late to the mosquito netting and there were socio-economic problems which are now being solved at the much better scale so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub-saharan Africa and UN says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent now this sounds a little theoretical but it's not so theoretically you know these economists they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of economy we in public health we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it's sort of the same percentage if your economy grow with 4% you ought to reduce child mortality with 4% if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want so so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years and economists would never do that I have just divided into two period in the 90s only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent whereas now second gear is like Africa had first gear now they go into second gear but even this is not a fair representation of Africa because it's an average it's an average speed of reduction in Africa and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs still here child F per 1000 on that axis here we have year and I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries I give you Congo which was high Ghana lower and Kenya even lower and what has happened over the years since there here we go you can see with independence literacy improved you know and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene was improved and things got better but then in the eighties watch out here Congo got into civil war and they leveled off fear Ghana got very help fast this was the backlash in Kenya and go on a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down together still the standstill in Congo that's why we are today you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this serie improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one place that their countries are so different and they married to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about Europe as one place I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different everyone knows that and they are judged each country on how they are doing you know so so let me show the why the picture my country Sweden 1800 we were up there what the strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate it's very strange it's sort of embarrassing but we had that habit in Sweden you know that we counted all the child that's even if we didn't do anything about it and then you see these are famine years this was bad years and people got fed up with freedom my ancestors moved to the United States you know and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service and child mortality came though we never had a war Sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary school actually starting 1842 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later you have to realise that the investments we do in progress for long term investments is not about just five years it's long term investments and and and Sweden never reach Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1 percent when I calculate so we are off track that was Sweden is but you don't talk about it so much you know we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you Thailand see what a success story in Thailand from the 1960s how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels of Sweden and I'll give you another story Egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health he just was up here 1960 higher than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease you know and and malaria and a lot of problem and then they got the Aswan Dam they got electricity in the homes the increased education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible and the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did as it fastest you know Kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill now let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality I'm going to show you the relation between child mortality on this axis here this here is child mortality and here I have the family size the relation between child mortality and family size one two three four children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see the continent the dark blue here is sub-saharan Africa you know and the size of the bubble is the population and these are the so called developing countries they had high or very high child mortality and family size six to eight and and and the ones over there they were the so called Western countries they had low child mortality and small families what has happened what I want you now is to see with your own eyes the relation between falling child mortality and decrease in family size I just want not have any ruby has to see that for yourself this is what happened now I start the world here we come down with their educational smallpox better education you know health service it got on there China comes Indian to the Western box here you know and here Brazil is in the west of all India's approach' the first African countries coming into the Western ball and we get a lot of new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down here this is the vision we have isn't it and look now the African the first African countries here are coming in there we are today there is no such thing as a Western world and developing world this is the this is the report from UN which came out on Friday it's very good levels and Friends and child mortality except this page this page is very bad it's the categorization of countries it labels developing countries I can read from the listed developing countries Republic of Korea South Korea now they get some some how can they be developing countries they have here Singapore that the lowest child mortality in the world is Singapore they bypass Sweden and five years ago and they are label developing country they have here guitar it's a richest country in the world with aljazeera how the heck could they be developing this is crap the rest there is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fit to the data you know and we

this is once again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see the continent the dark blue here is sub-saharan Africa you know and the size of the bubble is the population and these are the so called developing countries they had high or very high child mortality and family size six to eight and and and the ones over there they were the so called Western countries they had low child mortality and small families what has happened what I want you now is to see with your own eyes the relation between falling child mortality and decrease in family size I just want not have any ruby has to see that for yourself this is what happened now I start the world here we come down with their educational smallpox better education you know health service it got on there China comes Indian to the Western box here you know and here Brazil is in the west of all India's approach' the first African countries coming into the Western ball and we get a lot of new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down here this is the vision we have isn't it and look now the African the first African countries here are coming in there we are today there is no such thing as a Western world and developing world this is the this is the report from UN which came out on Friday it's very good levels and Friends and child mortality except this page this page is very bad it's the categorization of countries it labels developing countries I can read from the listed developing countries Republic of Korea South Korea now they get some some how can they be developing countries they have here Singapore that the lowest child mortality in the world is Singapore they bypass Sweden and five years ago and they are label developing country they have here guitar it's a richest country in the world with aljazeera how the heck could they be developing this is crap the rest there is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fit to the data you know and we have to realize that we are all going to live into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look even if we look in Africa these are the African countries you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size even within Africa it's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health metrics and evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50% of the fallen child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we got get girls in school we will get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong that's why we must have that long-term perspective but we must measure the impact over ten years period it's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down into the corner why we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter or actor most important from humanitarian aspects it's a decent life for children we are talking about but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population let's be clear about that and the way to do that that is to get child mortality down get access to family planning and behind that a drive of female education and that is fully possible let's do it thank you very much you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] we are here today because United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries they're called Millennium Development Goals and the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them and by specifying eight different goals the United Nations have said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get a good life for people look here you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspects from aid to trade there's a second reason I like these Development Goals and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality the aim here is to reduce child mortality with two thirds from 1990 to 2050 that's a 4% reduction per year and this with measuring that's what make the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people and what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia in Middle East in Latin America and East Europe that is reducing with this rate and even my T Brazil is going down with 5% per year and Turkey with 7% per year so there's good news but then I hear people saying there is no progress in Africa and there's not even statistics in Africa to know what is happening I'll prove them wrong on both points come with me to the wonderful world of statistic I bring you to the webpage child mortality dot or you know where you can bag deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it's done by UN specialists you know and I will take Kenya as an example here you see the data don't panic now don't panic you know I'll help you through this it looks you know nasty like in in in college when you did like statistics man but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself from where do the date that come what is the origin of the data is it so that in Kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of a child and it's sent to the Statistical Office no low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization it exists but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family and it's not registered so what we rely on is not incomplete system we have interviews we have surveys and in this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and Oscar about birth history how many children did you have order you're alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what you used to be called a demographic Health Survey report but these surveys are costly so they can only be done with three to five years interval but they have good quality so this is this is a limitation and all these colored lines here are results each color is one serving but that's too complicated for today so I'll simplified for you and I give you one average point for each survey this was 1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when the expert in the UN have got these service in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and trend line and the trend line looks like this see here is the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing and they estimated that 2008 Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I was sad because we could see this this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic but in June I got the mail in my inbox from demographic Health Survey and it showed good news from Kenya I was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey then it just took another three months for you and to get it into their server and on Friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn't it nice isn't it nice yeah I was actually on Friday sitting in front of my computer and I saw that the death rate fall from 128 to 84 yes that morning you know so we celebrated but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress I'm going into some details here because you n do it like this they start 1992 they measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no progress that's unfair as a professor I think I have the right to propose something differently I would say at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend it's to two surveys and you can see what's happening now they have 2.4 percent had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya I may have joined these two points so what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality we have a decent trend it coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs and the reason here for Africa is especially important because 90s was a bad decade not only in Kenya but across Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was resistant for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got late to the mosquito netting and there were socio-economic problems which are now being solved at the much better scale so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub-saharan Africa and UN says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent now this sounds a little theoretical but it's not so theoretically you know these economists they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of economy we in public health we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it's sort of the same percentage if your economy grow with 4% you ought to reduce child mortality with 4% if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want so so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years and economists would never do that I have just divided into two period in the 90s only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent whereas now second gear is like Africa had first gear now they go into second gear but even this is not a fair representation of Africa because it's an average it's an average speed of reduction in Africa and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs still here child F per 1000 on that axis here we have year and I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries I give you Congo which was high Ghana lower and Kenya even lower and what has happened over the years since there here we go you can see with independence literacy improved you know and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene was improved and things got better but then in the eighties watch out here Congo got into civil war and they leveled off fear Ghana got very help fast this was the backlash in Kenya and go on a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down together still the standstill in Congo that's why we are today you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this serie improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one place that their countries are so different and they married to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about Europe as one place I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different everyone knows that and they are judged each country on how they are doing you know so so let me show the why the picture my country Sweden 1800 we were up there what the strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate it's very strange it's sort of embarrassing but we had that habit in Sweden you know that we counted all the child that's even if we didn't do anything about it and then you see these are famine years this was bad years and people got fed up with freedom my ancestors moved to the United States you know and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service and child mortality came though we never had a war Sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary school actually starting 1842 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later you have to realise that the investments we do in progress for long term investments is not about just five years it's long term investments and and and Sweden never reach Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1 percent when I calculate so we are off track that was Sweden is but you don't talk about it so much you know we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you Thailand see what a success story in Thailand from the 1960s how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels of Sweden and I'll give you another story Egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health he just was up here 1960 higher than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease you know and and malaria and a lot of problem and then they got the Aswan Dam they got electricity in the homes the increased education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible and the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did as it fastest you know Kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill now let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality I'm going to show you the relation between child mortality on this axis here this here is child mortality and here I have the family size the relation between child mortality and family size one two three four children per woman six seven eight children per woman

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Keister, a person's buttocks. Though the modern meaning of keister refers somewhat indecorously to a person's behind, the word's history does not begin with the rear end. Instead, it can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European kista, which described a woven container. Kista influenced the creation of words like the Greek kiste, meaning basket or box, and later, the Latin cista, which meant box or chest. In proto-Germanic, a sturdy, box-like container was described by the word kista, which eventually gave us chest in English. For every locked chest, there is both a key and a lock pick, and the history of keister draws us into this world of petty crime and speculative etymology. Keister may have come from the British dialect kist, which was the northern form of chest. In the underworld jargon of the late 1800s, it referred to a burgler's tool kit that can be locked, and by the early 20th century, it meant safe or strong box. Numerous theories about keister's connection to the buttocks abound, one being, that is courtesy of the slang sense, used by pick-pockets to describe the treasure of a rear trouser pocket. Unfortunately, what isn't safe in your kist may not be safe near your keister either.

Twenty-one grams. That is the mass of all of the electrons in
your body if, like me, you weigh about 70 kilograms. Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism,
which means that as your electrons are traveling through space time, they interact with the
Higgs field and it is that that gives them their mass. It slows them down and stops them from traveling
at the speed of light. But most of your mass doesn’t come from
the Higgs mechanism. And neither does all of this stuff that you
see around you. The mass is coming from somewhere quite different
and that is because most of your mass and most of this mass comes from neutrons and
protons and they are not fundamental particles. They are made of constituent particles called
quarks. Now the theory that describes quarks and their
interactions with each other through gluons is called quantum chromo dynamics. And chromo is the Greek word for color. So in some way these objects are meant to
carry the color charge. But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength
of visible light, so there is no way that they are actually colored, but it is a useful
analogy that helps us think about how they interact and the particles that they can make
up. Now the rules are pretty simple. In order for a particle to exist, it must
be colorless or white, like this house. Now you can accomplish that in two different
ways. You could make three quarks in where each
one is a different color, red, green and blue, so overall they combine to produce white. Or you could use a quark and an anti quark
where one is a color like green and the other is its anti color, say, magenta. Now what I would like to do on this little
patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks actually bind together and form different
particles. Now for this you need to remember that in
the last video we talked about how empty space is not truly empty. So the beach here is has these undulations
in it which represent the fluctuations in the gluon field. But you have to imagine this beach sort of
rippling and these bumps coming and going. Now that is really important, because to get
rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy. And this is an important part of binding the
quarks together. The existence of quarks actually suppresses
the gluon fluctuations and creates what is called a flux tube, an area where there is
really nothing in the vacuum and that is in between this quark and the anti quark. And that pairs them up and creates what is
called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair. What is interesting about that flux tube is
that as these quarks become more separated, the flux tube remains the same diameter and
the same sort of depth of suppression of the field, which means that the force doesn't
actually increase. It is not like a spring. It is not like an elastic band. The force is the same that is pulling these
quarks back together. But you are putting more work in as you move
these quarks and anti quarks further apart. And so for a time people thought: Well, these
quarks are always going t be confined, however far you move them. You are just going to get a really long flux
tube. But what actually happens is you that you
put in enough energy that you can actually create a quark, anti quark pair. >> Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined. You can never see an individual quark, because
if you try to pull it out, you put so much energy into the situation that another quark,
anti quark pair will be created. >> Now to form a proton, we are going to need
an up quark, another up quark and a down quark. Now the standard model of a proton that you
have probably seen involves these quarks bounded together by little gluon springs that go between
them. >> We know that that picture is totally wrong
now. Even in the best sense you might have hoped
that you would see flux tubes around the edge of the triangle. But we know that, in fact, they don’t do
that. That you get these y shaped flex tubes. >> The crazy thing about a proton is that
there may be more than three quarks there. You see, you can have additional quark, anti
quark pairs pop in and out of existence. So at any given time there could be five or
seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could make up a proton. So this is what a proton actually looks like. You can see that the quarks like to sit on
those lumps in the gluon field. And you can see the two up quarks and a down
quark, but there is also a strange quark and an anti strange quark, which is strange, because
you don’t normally think of these quarks being inside a proton, but they can be at
any particular point in time. And you can also see that these quarks have
cleared out the vacuum. And you can see that there is kind of these
flux tubes which are the areas where the gluon field has been suppressed. And that is really what is binding these quarks
together. >> That is the strong force that binds quarks
into the heart of the proton. >> It is intrinsically related to the fact
that clearing out those fluctuations has more energy than where they are. >> That is right. It costs energy to clear the vacuum. >> So where is the mass of the proton really
coming from? Well, of course, the constituent quarks do
interact with the Higgs field and that gives them a small amount of mass. But if you add up the mass of all the quarks
in the proton it would only account for about one percent of its total mass. So where is the rest of the mass coming from? The answer is: energy. You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E
equals mc squared. Well, that says we have got a lot of energy
for just a little bit of a mass. But if you rearrange the equation you can
see that we can get an amount of mass if there is lots of energy there. And that is really where most of the mass
of the proton is coming from. It is from the fact that there are these energy
fluctuations in the gluon field and the quarks are interacting with those gluons. That is where your mass is coming from. It is coming from the energy that is in there. You know, Einstein talked about, well, if
I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually have a slightly greater mass than the same
cup of tea when cold. And he was right. I mean, you can’t measure it with a cup
of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that
your mass is packed with energy, because of the interactions between the quarks and these
gluon fluctuations in that gluon field. I think it is extraordinary, because what
we think of as ordinarily empty space, you know, that turns out to be the thing that
gives us all most of our mass. I really want to thank Audible.com for supporting

of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that
your mass is packed with energy, because of the interactions between the quarks and these
gluon fluctuations in that gluon field. I think it is extraordinary, because what
we think of as ordinarily empty space, you know, that turns out to be the thing that
gives us all most of our mass. I really want to thank Audible.com for supporting

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9: What is the main contributor to the mass of a proton? 

This question is similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, which asks where most of the mass from objects comes from. Both questions are related to the origin of mass, and the correct options (B. The energy fluctuations in the gluon field and C. Protons and neutrons, respectively) point to the idea that the mass of objects or protons comes from the interactions of their constituent particles, rather than the particles themselves.

**Transcript**:
Twenty-one grams. That is the mass of all of the electrons in
your body if, like me, you weigh about 70 kilograms. Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism,
which means that as your electrons are traveling through space time, they interact with the
Higgs field and it is that that gives them their mass. It slows them down and stops them from traveling
at the speed of light. But most of your mass doesn’t come from
the Higgs mechanism. And neither does all of this stuff that you
see around you. The mass is coming from somewhere quite different
and that is because most of your mass and most of this mass comes from neutrons and
protons and they are not fundamental particles. They are made of constituent particles called
quarks. Now the theory that describes quarks and their
interactions with each other through gluons is called quantum chromo dynamics. And chromo is the Greek word for color. So in some way these objects are meant to
carry the color charge. But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength
of visible light, so there is no way that they are actually colored, but it is a useful
analogy that helps us think about how they interact and the particles that they can make
up. Now the rules are pretty simple. In order for a particle to exist, it must
be colorless or white, like this house. Now you can accomplish that in two different
ways. You could make three quarks in where each
one is a different color, red, green and blue, so overall they combine to produce white. Or you could use a quark and an anti quark
where one is a color like green and the other is its anti color, say, magenta. Now what I would like to do on this little
patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks actually bind together and form different
particles. Now for this you need to remember that in
the last video we talked about how empty space is not truly empty. So the beach here is has these undulations
in it which represent the fluctuations in the gluon field. But you have to imagine this beach sort of
rippling and these bumps coming and going. Now that is really important, because to get
rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy. And this is an important part of binding the
quarks together. The existence of quarks actually suppresses
the gluon fluctuations and creates what is called a flux tube, an area where there is
really nothing in the vacuum and that is in between this quark and the anti quark. And that pairs them up and creates what is
called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair. What is interesting about that flux tube is
that as these quarks become more separated, the flux tube remains the same diameter and
the same sort of depth of suppression of the field, which means that the force doesn't
actually increase. It is not like a spring. It is not like an elastic band. The force is the same that is pulling these
quarks back together. But you are putting more work in as you move
these quarks and anti quarks further apart. And so for a time people thought: Well, these
quarks are always going t be confined, however far you move them. You are just going to get a really long flux
tube. But what actually happens is you that you
put in enough energy that you can actually create a quark, anti quark pair. >> Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined. You can never see an individual quark, because
if you try to pull it out, you put so much energy into the situation that another quark,
anti quark pair will be created. >> Now to form a proton, we are going to need
an up quark, another up quark and a down quark. Now the standard model of a proton that you
have probably seen involves these quarks bounded together by little gluon springs that go between
them. >> We know that that picture is totally wrong
now. Even in the best sense you might have hoped
that you would see flux tubes around the edge of the triangle. But we know that, in fact, they don’t do
that. That you get these y shaped flex tubes. >> The crazy thing about a proton is that
there may be more than three quarks there. You see, you can have additional quark, anti
quark pairs pop in and out of existence. So at any given time there could be five or
seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could make up a proton. So this is what a proton actually looks like. You can see that the quarks like to sit on
those lumps in the gluon field. And you can see the two up quarks and a down
quark, but there is also a strange quark and an anti strange quark, which is strange, because
you don’t normally think of these quarks being inside a proton, but they can be at
any particular point in time. And you can also see that these quarks have
cleared out the vacuum. And you can see that there is kind of these
flux tubes which are the areas where the gluon field has been suppressed. And that is really what is binding these quarks
together. >> That is the strong force that binds quarks
into the heart of the proton. >> It is intrinsically related to the fact
that clearing out those fluctuations has more energy than where they are. >> That is right. It costs energy to clear the vacuum. >> So where is the mass of the proton really
coming from? Well, of course, the constituent quarks do
interact with the Higgs field and that gives them a small amount of mass. But if you add up the mass of all the quarks
in the proton it would only account for about one percent of its total mass. So where is the rest of the mass coming from? The answer is: energy. You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E
equals mc squared. Well, that says we have got a lot of energy
for just a little bit of a mass. But if you rearrange the equation you can
see that we can get an amount of mass if there is lots of energy there. And that is really where most of the mass
of the proton is coming from. It is from the fact that there are these energy
fluctuations in the gluon field and the quarks are interacting with those gluons. That is where your mass is coming from. It is coming from the energy that is in there. You know, Einstein talked about, well, if
I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually have a slightly greater mass than the same
cup of tea when cold. And he was right. I mean, you can’t measure it with a cup
of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that asks about the quark combination required to form a proton.

Although not an exact match, Question 5: "How do quarks combine to form a colorless particle?" is related to the topic, but it doesn't specifically ask about the quark combination for a proton.

If I had to choose the most similar question from the provided options, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but with a low confidence level.

However, I would like to propose a new question that is not present in the generated MCQs but is a closer match to the ground truth MCQ:

Question X: What is the minimum quark combination required to form a proton?
Options: A. 2 down quarks, 1 up quark, B. 1 strange quark, 2 up quarks, C. 1 charmed quark, 2 up quarks, D. 2 up quarks, 1 down quark

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, but it is a closer match to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index from the provided options, I would say:

Index: 5 (with low confidence)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, and the proposed Question X is a closer match.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other. You never see an Indian come and endeavor
to make the white people do so." It's Tecumseh.
Drop the mic... [dinging noise] is something that I would do except that the mic is actually attached to my shirt so there's n– there's no drama in this. Clearly a Native American criticism of white people, and I happen to know that that particular one comes from Tecumseh and I don't get shocked today. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans were continuing to push westward into territories where Indians were living. I mean, this was a big reason for the Louisiana
Purchase after all. By the beginning of the war, more than 400,000 settlers had moved into territories west of the original 13 colonies and they outnumbered American Indians by a significant margin. Some native groups responded with a measure
of assimilation. Cherokees like John Ross wanted to become
more "civilized", that is, more white and farmer-y. And some of them did even adopt such civilized practices as written languages and slavery, the most civilized practice of all. [sigh] People are always like, "Why aren't
you more celebratory of American History?" Well, why isn't there more to celebrate? But other Indians wanted to resist. The best known of these were the aforementioned
Tecumseh and his brother Tensk – Stan, can you just put it on the screen? [Tenskwatawa on screen] Yes.
Let's just enjoy looking at that. Right, that's just for all you visual learners. So he was also known as The Prophet, because of his religious teachings, and also because of the pronunciation issues. The Prophet encouraged Indians, especially those living in and around the settlement of Prophetstown, to abandon the ways of the whites, primarily in the form of alcohol and manufactured consumer goods. So stop drinking alcohol and eating refined
sugars – this guy sounds like my doctor! Tecumseh was more militant; attempting to revive Neolin's idea of pan-Indianism and actively resisting white settlement. As he put it, "Sell a country, why not sell
the air, the great sea, as well as the Earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for
the use of his children?" The Americans responded to this reasonable
criticism in the traditional manner – with guns. William Henry Harrison destroyed the native settlement at Prophetstown in what would become known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. He would later ride that fame all the way to the
presidency in 1840 and then – SPOILER ALERT: He would give the longest inauguration address
ever, catch a cold, and die 40 days later. Let that be a lesson to you, American
politicians: Long speeches? Fatal! So I just painted a pretty negative picture of the American treatment of the Indians – because it was awful. But I haven't mentioned how this relates to
the War of 1812. The Americans were receiving reports that the British were encouraging Tecumseh, which they probably were. And the important thing to remember here is that the War of 1812, like the Seven Years War and the American Revolution was also a war against Indians. And as in those other two wars, the Indians
were the biggest losers. And not in the cool way of biggest loser where, like, Trainer Bob helps you lose weight, but in the really sad way, where your entire civilization gets John C. Calhouned. So the War of 1812 was the first time that
the United States declared war on anybody. It was also the smallest margin of a declaration of war vote: 79 to 49 in the House and 19 to 13 in the Senate. Northern States, which relied on trade a lot, didn't want to go to war, while southern and western states, which were more agrarian and wanted expansion to get land for farming and slavery, did. The closeness of the vote reflects a profound
ambivalence about the war. As Henry Adams wrote, "Many Nations have gone to war in pure gaiety of the heart, but perhaps the United States were the first to force themselves into a war they dreaded, in the hope that the war itself might create the spirit they lacked." Don't worry, Henry Adams! In the future we're gonna
get pretty gaiety of heart-ish about war. Anyway, as an actual war, the War of 1812
was something of a farce. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The US army numbered 10-12 thousand and its officers were sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking. The US navy had 17 ships.
Great Britain had 1,000. Also, America had very little money, Britain
collected 40 times more tax revenue than the US. But Britain was busy fighting Napoleon, which is why they didn't really start kicking America's butt until 1814, after Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon's defeat was also the practice of impressment, since Britain didn't need so many sailors anymore. Initially, much of the war consisted of America's attempts to take Canada, which any map will show you went smashingly. Americans were confident the Canadians would rush to join the US. When marching from Detroit, General
William Hull informed the Canadians that, "You will be emancipated from tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified station of free men." And the Canadians were like, "Yeah, we're
okay actually." And so the British in Canada, with their Indian allies, went ahead and captured Detroit and then forced Hull's surrender. America's lack of success in Canada was primarily
attributable to terrible strategy. They might have succeeded if they'd taken Montreal, but they didn't want to march through northern New York because it was full of Federalists who were opposed to the war. Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that
the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name. It's hard out there for a Cockburn. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Given these problems it's amazing there were
any American successes, but there were. The battleship USS Constitution broke the myth of British naval invincibility when cannonballs bounced off it and earned it the nickname "Old Ironsides". Oliver Hazard Perry defeated a British fleet,
in, of all places, Lake Erie. At the battle of the Thames, William Harry
Harrison defeated Tecumseh. And the battle of Horseshoe Ben showed one of the reasons why Indians were defeated when Andrew Jackson played one group of Creeks against another group of Creeks and Cherokees. 800 Indians were killed in that battle. And speaking of Jackson, the most notable American victory of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which catapulted him to prominence. He lost only 71 men while inflicting 2,036
British casualties. Of course, the most memorable thing about the battle is that it took place two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed. But hey, that's not Jackson's fault. Again – no twitter, #1815problems. The treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, proved just how necessary the war had been: not at all. No territory changed hands when
negotiations started. And in August 1814, the British asked for Northern Maine, demilitarization of The Great Lakes, and some territory to create an independent nation for the Indians, and the Northwest. But none of that happened, not because the U.S.
was in a particularly good negotiating position, but it would have been awkward for Great Britain to carve out pieces of the US, and then tell Russia and Prussia that they couldn't take pieces of Europe for themselves to celebrate their victory in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no provisions in the treaty about impressment or free trade and basically the treaty returned everything to the status quo. So, neither the US or Great Britain actually
won. But the Indians suffered significant casualties
and gave up even more territory, definitely lost. So with a treaty like that, the war must have had a negligible impact on American history, right? Except, no; the war of 1812 confirmed that
the US would exist. Britain would never invade American again
(until 1961). I mean the US were good customers, and Great Britain was happy to let them trade, as long as that trade wasn't helping a French dictator. The War launched Andrew Jackson's career and solidified the settlement and conquest of land east of the Mississippi River. And our lack of success in Canada reinforced Canadian nationalism while also ensuring that instead of becoming one great nation, we would forever be Canada's pants. The war also spelled the end of the Federalist Party, which tried in 1815 with the Hartford Convention to change the constitution. In retrospect, the Hartford Convention proposals
actually look pretty reasonable. They wanted to eliminate the clause wherein
black people were counted as 3/5 of a human, and require a 2/3 congressional majority
to declare war. But Because they had their convention right before Jackson's victory at New Orleans, they only came off looking unpatriotic and out of touch, as the elite so often do. It's hard to argue that the Americans really
won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's
international interventions, you need to remember, it didn't begin in Afghanistan or even Europe;
it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other. You never see an Indian come and endeavor
to make the white people do so." It's Tecumseh.
Drop the mic... [dinging noise] is something that I would do except that the mic is actually attached to my shirt so there's n– there's no drama in this. Clearly a Native American criticism of white people, and I happen to know that that particular one comes from Tecumseh and I don't get shocked today. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans were continuing to push westward into territories where Indians were living. I mean, this was a big reason for the Louisiana
Purchase after all. By the beginning of the war, more than 400,000 settlers had moved into territories west of the original 13 colonies and they outnumbered American Indians by a significant margin. Some native groups responded with a measure
of assimilation. Cherokees like John Ross wanted to become
more "civilized", that is, more white and farmer-y. And some of them did even adopt such civilized practices as written languages and slavery, the most civilized practice of all. [sigh] People are always like, "Why aren't
you more celebratory of American History?" Well, why isn't there more to celebrate? But other Indians wanted to resist. The best known of these were the aforementioned
Tecumseh and his brother Tensk – Stan, can you just put it on the screen? [Tenskwatawa on screen] Yes.
Let's just enjoy looking at that. Right, that's just for all you visual learners. So he was also known as The Prophet, because of his religious teachings, and also because of the pronunciation issues. The Prophet encouraged Indians, especially those living in and around the settlement of Prophetstown, to abandon the ways of the whites, primarily in the form of alcohol and manufactured consumer goods. So stop drinking alcohol and eating refined
sugars – this guy sounds like my doctor! Tecumseh was more militant; attempting to revive Neolin's idea of pan-Indianism and actively resisting white settlement. As he put it, "Sell a country, why not sell
the air, the great sea, as well as the Earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for
the use of his children?" The Americans responded to this reasonable
criticism in the traditional manner – with guns. William Henry Harrison destroyed the native settlement at Prophetstown in what would become known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. He would later ride that fame all the way to the
presidency in 1840 and then – SPOILER ALERT: He would give the longest inauguration address
ever, catch a cold, and die 40 days later. Let that be a lesson to you, American
politicians: Long speeches? Fatal! So I just painted a pretty negative picture of the American treatment of the Indians – because it was awful. But I haven't mentioned how this relates to
the War of 1812. The Americans were receiving reports that the British were encouraging Tecumseh, which they probably were. And the important thing to remember here is that the War of 1812, like the Seven Years War and the American Revolution was also a war against Indians. And as in those other two wars, the Indians
were the biggest losers. And not in the cool way of biggest loser where, like, Trainer Bob helps you lose weight, but in the really sad way, where your entire civilization gets John C. Calhouned. So the War of 1812 was the first time that
the United States declared war on anybody. It was also the smallest margin of a declaration of war vote: 79 to 49 in the House and 19 to 13 in the Senate. Northern States, which relied on trade a lot, didn't want to go to war, while southern and western states, which were more agrarian and wanted expansion to get land for farming and slavery, did. The closeness of the vote reflects a profound
ambivalence about the war. As Henry Adams wrote, "Many Nations have gone to war in pure gaiety of the heart, but perhaps the United States were the first to force themselves into a war they dreaded, in the hope that the war itself might create the spirit they lacked." Don't worry, Henry Adams! In the future we're gonna
get pretty gaiety of heart-ish about war. Anyway, as an actual war, the War of 1812
was something of a farce. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The US army numbered 10-12 thousand and its officers were sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking. The US navy had 17 ships.
Great Britain had 1,000. Also, America had very little money, Britain
collected 40 times more tax revenue than the US. But Britain was busy fighting Napoleon, which is why they didn't really start kicking America's butt until 1814, after Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon's defeat was also the practice of impressment, since Britain didn't need so many sailors anymore. Initially, much of the war consisted of America's attempts to take Canada, which any map will show you went smashingly. Americans were confident the Canadians would rush to join the US. When marching from Detroit, General
William Hull informed the Canadians that, "You will be emancipated from tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified station of free men." And the Canadians were like, "Yeah, we're
okay actually." And so the British in Canada, with their Indian allies, went ahead and captured Detroit and then forced Hull's surrender. America's lack of success in Canada was primarily
attributable to terrible strategy. They might have succeeded if they'd taken Montreal, but they didn't want to march through northern New York because it was full of Federalists who were opposed to the war. Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that
the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name. It's hard out there for a Cockburn. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Given these problems it's amazing there were
any American successes, but there were. The battleship USS Constitution broke the myth of British naval invincibility when cannonballs bounced off it and earned it the nickname "Old Ironsides". Oliver Hazard Perry defeated a British fleet,
in, of all places, Lake Erie. At the battle of the Thames, William Harry
Harrison defeated Tecumseh. And the battle of Horseshoe Ben showed one of the reasons why Indians were defeated when Andrew Jackson played one group of Creeks against another group of Creeks and Cherokees. 800 Indians were killed in that battle. And speaking of Jackson, the most notable American victory of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which catapulted him to prominence. He lost only 71 men while inflicting 2,036
British casualties. Of course, the most memorable thing about the battle is that it took place two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed. But hey, that's not Jackson's fault. Again – no twitter, #1815problems. The treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, proved just how necessary the war had been: not at all. No territory changed hands when
negotiations started. And in August 1814, the British asked for Northern Maine, demilitarization of The Great Lakes, and some territory to create an independent nation for the Indians, and the Northwest. But none of that happened, not because the U.S.
was in a particularly good negotiating position, but it would have been awkward for Great Britain to carve out pieces of the US, and then tell Russia and Prussia that they couldn't take pieces of Europe for themselves to celebrate their victory in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no provisions in the treaty about impressment or free trade and basically the treaty returned everything to the status quo. So, neither the US or Great Britain actually
won. But the Indians suffered significant casualties
and gave up even more territory, definitely lost. So with a treaty like that, the war must have had a negligible impact on American history, right? Except, no; the war of 1812 confirmed that
the US would exist. Britain would never invade American again
(until 1961). I mean the US were good customers, and Great Britain was happy to let them trade, as long as that trade wasn't helping a French dictator. The War launched Andrew Jackson's career and solidified the settlement and conquest of land east of the Mississippi River. And our lack of success in Canada reinforced Canadian nationalism while also ensuring that instead of becoming one great nation, we would forever be Canada's pants. The war also spelled the end of the Federalist Party, which tried in 1815 with the Hartford Convention to change the constitution. In retrospect, the Hartford Convention proposals
actually look pretty reasonable. They wanted to eliminate the clause wherein
black people were counted as 3/5 of a human, and require a 2/3 congressional majority
to declare war. But Because they had their convention right before Jackson's victory at New Orleans, they only came off looking unpatriotic and out of touch, as the elite so often do. It's hard to argue that the Americans really
won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's
international interventions, you need to remember, it didn't begin in Afghanistan or even Europe;
it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that
the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name. It's hard out there for a Cockburn. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Given these problems it's amazing there were
any American successes, but there were. The battleship USS Constitution broke the myth of British naval invincibility when cannonballs bounced off it and earned it the nickname "Old Ironsides". Oliver Hazard Perry defeated a British fleet,
in, of all places, Lake Erie. At the battle of the Thames, William Harry
Harrison defeated Tecumseh. And the battle of Horseshoe Ben showed one of the reasons why Indians were defeated when Andrew Jackson played one group of Creeks against another group of Creeks and Cherokees. 800 Indians were killed in that battle. And speaking of Jackson, the most notable American victory of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which catapulted him to prominence. He lost only 71 men while inflicting 2,036
British casualties. Of course, the most memorable thing about the battle is that it took place two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed. But hey, that's not Jackson's fault. Again – no twitter, #1815problems. The treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, proved just how necessary the war had been: not at all. No territory changed hands when
negotiations started. And in August 1814, the British asked for Northern Maine, demilitarization of The Great Lakes, and some territory to create an independent nation for the Indians, and the Northwest. But none of that happened, not because the U.S.
was in a particularly good negotiating position, but it would have been awkward for Great Britain to carve out pieces of the US, and then tell Russia and Prussia that they couldn't take pieces of Europe for themselves to celebrate their victory in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no provisions in the treaty about impressment or free trade and basically the treaty returned everything to the status quo. So, neither the US or Great Britain actually
won. But the Indians suffered significant casualties
and gave up even more territory, definitely lost. So with a treaty like that, the war must have had a negligible impact on American history, right? Except, no; the war of 1812 confirmed that
the US would exist. Britain would never invade American again
(until 1961). I mean the US were good customers, and Great Britain was happy to let them trade, as long as that trade wasn't helping a French dictator. The War launched Andrew Jackson's career and solidified the settlement and conquest of land east of the Mississippi River. And our lack of success in Canada reinforced Canadian nationalism while also ensuring that instead of becoming one great nation, we would forever be Canada's pants. The war also spelled the end of the Federalist Party, which tried in 1815 with the Hartford Convention to change the constitution. In retrospect, the Hartford Convention proposals
actually look pretty reasonable. They wanted to eliminate the clause wherein
black people were counted as 3/5 of a human, and require a 2/3 congressional majority
to declare war. But Because they had their convention right before Jackson's victory at New Orleans, they only came off looking unpatriotic and out of touch, as the elite so often do. It's hard to argue that the Americans really
won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's
international interventions, you need to remember, it didn't begin in Afghanistan or even Europe;
it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other. You never see an Indian come and endeavor
to make the white people do so." It's Tecumseh.
Drop the mic... [dinging noise] is something that I would do except that the mic is actually attached to my shirt so there's n– there's no drama in this. Clearly a Native American criticism of white people, and I happen to know that that particular one comes from Tecumseh and I don't get shocked today. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans were continuing to push westward into territories where Indians were living. I mean, this was a big reason for the Louisiana
Purchase after all. By the beginning of the war, more than 400,000 settlers had moved into territories west of the original 13 colonies and they outnumbered American Indians by a significant margin. Some native groups responded with a measure
of assimilation. Cherokees like John Ross wanted to become
more "civilized", that is, more white and farmer-y. And some of them did even adopt such civilized practices as written languages and slavery, the most civilized practice of all. [sigh] People are always like, "Why aren't
you more celebratory of American History?" Well, why isn't there more to celebrate? But other Indians wanted to resist. The best known of these were the aforementioned
Tecumseh and his brother Tensk – Stan, can you just put it on the screen? [Tenskwatawa on screen] Yes.
Let's just enjoy looking at that. Right, that's just for all you visual learners. So he was also known as The Prophet, because of his religious teachings, and also because of the pronunciation issues. The Prophet encouraged Indians, especially those living in and around the settlement of Prophetstown, to abandon the ways of the whites, primarily in the form of alcohol and manufactured consumer goods. So stop drinking alcohol and eating refined
sugars – this guy sounds like my doctor! Tecumseh was more militant; attempting to revive Neolin's idea of pan-Indianism and actively resisting white settlement. As he put it, "Sell a country, why not sell
the air, the great sea, as well as the Earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for
the use of his children?" The Americans responded to this reasonable
criticism in the traditional manner – with guns. William Henry Harrison destroyed the native settlement at Prophetstown in what would become known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. He would later ride that fame all the way to the
presidency in 1840 and then – SPOILER ALERT: He would give the longest inauguration address
ever, catch a cold, and die 40 days later. Let that be a lesson to you, American
politicians: Long speeches? Fatal! So I just painted a pretty negative picture of the American treatment of the Indians – because it was awful. But I haven't mentioned how this relates to
the War of 1812. The Americans were receiving reports that the British were encouraging Tecumseh, which they probably were. And the important thing to remember here is that the War of 1812, like the Seven Years War and the American Revolution was also a war against Indians. And as in those other two wars, the Indians
were the biggest losers. And not in the cool way of biggest loser where, like, Trainer Bob helps you lose weight, but in the really sad way, where your entire civilization gets John C. Calhouned. So the War of 1812 was the first time that
the United States declared war on anybody. It was also the smallest margin of a declaration of war vote: 79 to 49 in the House and 19 to 13 in the Senate. Northern States, which relied on trade a lot, didn't want to go to war, while southern and western states, which were more agrarian and wanted expansion to get land for farming and slavery, did. The closeness of the vote reflects a profound
ambivalence about the war. As Henry Adams wrote, "Many Nations have gone to war in pure gaiety of the heart, but perhaps the United States were the first to force themselves into a war they dreaded, in the hope that the war itself might create the spirit they lacked." Don't worry, Henry Adams! In the future we're gonna
get pretty gaiety of heart-ish about war. Anyway, as an actual war, the War of 1812
was something of a farce. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The US army numbered 10-12 thousand and its officers were sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking. The US navy had 17 ships.
Great Britain had 1,000. Also, America had very little money, Britain
collected 40 times more tax revenue than the US. But Britain was busy fighting Napoleon, which is why they didn't really start kicking America's butt until 1814, after Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon's defeat was also the practice of impressment, since Britain didn't need so many sailors anymore. Initially, much of the war consisted of America's attempts to take Canada, which any map will show you went smashingly. Americans were confident the Canadians would rush to join the US. When marching from Detroit, General
William Hull informed the Canadians that, "You will be emancipated from tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified station of free men." And the Canadians were like, "Yeah, we're
okay actually." And so the British in Canada, with their Indian allies, went ahead and captured Detroit and then forced Hull's surrender. America's lack of success in Canada was primarily
attributable to terrible strategy. They might have succeeded if they'd taken Montreal, but they didn't want to march through northern New York because it was full of Federalists who were opposed to the war. Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that

**Transcript**:
Most of us think of the Sun as our friend. It helps plants grow, keeps us warm, and who doesn't love to lie on the beach on a sunny day? But for all of it's good qualities, the Sun can also be harmful in large amounts. That's why we invented sunscreen. The purpose of sunscreen is to shield the body from the Sun's ultraviolet rays, which have several harmful effects, including sunburn, aging, and skin cancer promotion. These rays are separated by their different wave lengths, into types such as UVA and UVB, which exert a variety of effects in the skin due to the absorption patterns of chromophores, the parts of the molecules responsible for their color. The primary two chromophores are hemoglobin, found in our red blood cells, and melanin, which gives our skin its pigment. We know that UVB rays cause the skin to burn. The role of UVA rays is less well understood and appears to have an effect on our tanning response, carcinogenesis, and aging. So, how does the sunscreen protect us from these rays? There are two basic types of sunscreen, physical and chemical blockers. Physical blockers, like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, reflect the Sun's rays by acting as a physical barrier. If you've seen lifeguards with noses covered in white, then you know what this looks like. The same ingredients are primary components of diaper creams, where the goal is also to create a physical barrier. Historically, they haven't always been easy to apply and were conspicuously visible on the skin, but new formulations have made this less of an issue. Chemical blockers, on the other hand, absorb the Sun's rays. They deteriorate more quickly than physical sunscreens because their ability to absorb the Sun diminishes. Generally, these are more transparent when rubbed on the skin, but some people develop allergric reactions to some of the chemicals. Regardless of the type of sunscreen, all are subjected to testing to determine their sunburn protection factor, or SPF. This is essentially a measure of the protection that the sunscreen will provide from UVB rays before one begins to burn. But even if you don't burn, you still need to use sunscreen because unless you live in a cave, you're not immune to the effects of the Sun. It is true that darker skinned people and those who tan easily have more built-in protection from sunburns, but they are still vulnerable to the effects of UVA. Children under the age of six months, on the other hand, should have almost no sun exposure as their protective mechanisms are not fully functioning, and their skin is more likely to absorb any sunscreen that is applied. Wearing sunscreen helps protect against the development of all three types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. On a daily basis, the DNA in your cells is developing mutations and errors that are generally handled by machinery within your cells, but ultraviolet rays from the Sun lead to mutations that the cell may not be able to overcome, leading to uncontrolled growth and eventual skin cancer. The scariest thing about this is that usually you can't even see it happening until its too late. But if these concrete risks to your health are not enough to convince you to use sunscreen, there are aesthetic reasons as well. Along with cigarette smoking, sun damage is the leading cause of premature aging. Photoaging from chronic sun exposure leads to a loss of elasticity in the skin, in other words, making it look saggy. Take a look at this truck driver who's left side was chronically exposed to the sun and notice the difference. This is an important point. Car windows block UVB, the burn rays, but not UVA, the aging rays. It is recommended to use sunscreen daily, but you should pay special attention before prolonged sun exposure or when at the beach or among snow since the reflectivity of water and ice amplifies the Sun's rays. For these cases, apply about an ounce fifteen to thirty minutes before you go out and once again soon after you get outside. After that, you should reapply it every two to three hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Otherwise you should wear protective clothing with ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF. Stay in shaded areas, such as under trees or an umbrella, and avoid the sun at the peak hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. And what's the best kind of sunscreen? Everyone will have their preference, but look for the following things: broad spectra, SPF of at least 30, and water-resistant. A light moisturizer with SPF 30 should be good for daily use. Take note if you decide to use a spray. They take several coats to effectively cover your skin, like painting a wall with a spray can versus a paint brush. So, enjoy the sun, but enjoy it with sunscreen.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match.

Although Question 2 does not specifically ask about the classification of ultraviolet rays, it does deal with the topic of ultraviolet rays and their effects. However, a more accurate match would be a question that directly asks about the classification or characteristics of ultraviolet rays.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the ground truth MCQ is related to chromophores in the skin, and the closest match would be a question that asks about chromophores or melanin.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic, I would say Question 3, but it's not a good match because it doesn't ask about chromophores or melanin specifically.

A good match would be a generated MCQ that asks: "What is the other primary chromophore in the skin, besides hemoglobin?" or something similar. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this question.

Therefore, I would say that there is no good match among the generated MCQs for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Most of us think of the Sun as our friend. It helps plants grow, keeps us warm, and who doesn't love to lie on the beach on a sunny day? But for all of it's good qualities, the Sun can also be harmful in large amounts. That's why we invented sunscreen. The purpose of sunscreen is to shield the body from the Sun's ultraviolet rays, which have several harmful effects, including sunburn, aging, and skin cancer promotion. These rays are separated by their different wave lengths, into types such as UVA and UVB, which exert a variety of effects in the skin due to the absorption patterns of chromophores, the parts of the molecules responsible for their color. The primary two chromophores are hemoglobin, found in our red blood cells, and melanin, which gives our skin its pigment. We know that UVB rays cause the skin to burn. The role of UVA rays is less well understood and appears to have an effect on our tanning response, carcinogenesis, and aging. So, how does the sunscreen protect us from these rays? There are two basic types of sunscreen, physical and chemical blockers. Physical blockers, like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, reflect the Sun's rays by acting as a physical barrier. If you've seen lifeguards with noses covered in white, then you know what this looks like. The same ingredients are primary components of diaper creams, where the goal is also to create a physical barrier. Historically, they haven't always been easy to apply and were conspicuously visible on the skin, but new formulations have made this less of an issue. Chemical blockers, on the other hand, absorb the Sun's rays. They deteriorate more quickly than physical sunscreens because their ability to absorb the Sun diminishes. Generally, these are more transparent when rubbed on the skin, but some people develop allergric reactions to some of the chemicals. Regardless of the type of sunscreen, all are subjected to testing to determine their sunburn protection factor, or SPF. This is essentially a measure of the protection that the sunscreen will provide from UVB rays before one begins to burn. But even if you don't burn, you still need to use sunscreen because unless you live in a cave, you're not immune to the effects of the Sun. It is true that darker skinned people and those who tan easily have more built-in protection from sunburns, but they are still vulnerable to the effects of UVA. Children under the age of six months, on the other hand, should have almost no sun exposure as their protective mechanisms are not fully functioning, and their skin is more likely to absorb any sunscreen that is applied. Wearing sunscreen helps protect against the development of all three types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. On a daily basis, the DNA in your cells is developing mutations and errors that are generally handled by machinery within your cells, but ultraviolet rays from the Sun lead to mutations that the cell may not be able to overcome, leading to uncontrolled growth and eventual skin cancer. The scariest thing about this is that usually you can't even see it happening until its too late. But if these concrete risks to your health are not enough to convince you to use sunscreen, there are aesthetic reasons as well. Along with cigarette smoking, sun damage is the leading cause of premature aging. Photoaging from chronic sun exposure leads to a loss of elasticity in the skin, in other words, making it look saggy. Take a look at this truck driver who's left side was chronically exposed to the sun and notice the difference. This is an important point. Car windows block UVB, the burn rays, but not UVA, the aging rays. It is recommended to use sunscreen daily, but you should pay special attention before prolonged sun exposure or when at the beach or among snow since the reflectivity of water and ice amplifies the Sun's rays. For these cases, apply about an ounce fifteen to thirty minutes before you go out and once again soon after you get outside. After that, you should reapply it every two to three hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Otherwise you should wear protective clothing with ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF. Stay in shaded areas, such as under trees or an umbrella, and avoid the sun at the peak hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. And what's the best kind of sunscreen? Everyone will have their preference, but look for the following things: broad spectra, SPF of at least 30, and water-resistant. A light moisturizer with SPF 30 should be good for daily use. Take note if you decide to use a spray. They take several coats to effectively cover your skin, like painting a wall with a spray can versus a paint brush. So, enjoy the sun, but enjoy it with sunscreen.

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: X-ray, a form of electromagnetic radiation capable of penetrating solids. The word X-ray harkens back to the work of Rene Descartes, a French philosopher, mathematician, and writer in the 17th century. One of Descartes innumerable contributions to the world of numbers was the invention of a simple yet brilliant convention most people take for granted today: the representation of unknowns within an equation as X, Y, and Z. When the German scientist Wilhelm Rontgen discovered what we now call X-rays in the late 19th century, he gave them the name X-strahlen. Strahlen is German for shine, and X, of course, represented the unknown nature of the radiation Rontgen had discovered, the X-factor, so to speak. The English translation maintained the X but replaced the German shine with ray, meaning a beam of light. Coincidentally, in mathematics, the word ray refers to a line with a point of origin that has no end and extends to infinity, bringing us neatly back to the unknown. Today we understand what X-radiation is, and in spite of the humble objections of its discoverer, it is also commonly called Rontgen Radiation, eliminating with the X the fundamental mystery of its nature.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

bones themselves once you put up a dinosaur skeleton it's very very difficult to take it back down again there are actually some very wrong dinosaurs they're still up in a lot of Institutions if you go to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City you'll see dinosaurs that have broken tails and Broken Backs they're still dragging their tails they're still looking as they did in the early 20th century just because it's impossible to remove them from the plaster and from the armatures that they were put on that's Brian suek he's a dinosaur expert and author of my beloved brosaurus the story of a popular culture icon that's warmed the hearts of children for over a century unfortunately brosaurus isn't a real dinosaur scientists began figuring that out over a hundred years ago when Brian first met the mighty brosaurus as a young boy it had been a whopping 80 years since the scientific Community stopped calling it that 80 years but there it was in a Dusty Museum label and all as I was sort of walking by the the Brontosaurus skeleton you know myself just maybe knee high to the dinosaur itself at best I just remember looking up and imagining what it would be like to actually see the animal sort of fleshed out to hear it breathing to see it moving moving you know how this animal actually lived and then when I got home and I started you know looking into uh all the books that I had and you know talking to my teachers about dinosaurs you know I wasn't crushed by it but I found out that brontosaurus wasn't a real dinosaur you know it was this Chimera that uh had come together because of sort of fossil mistakes and you know hypotheses that later turned out to be incorrect it's a classic bone Wars era story The brosaurus is in fact an Apatosaurus but it took scientists a while to realize their mistak stakes and by then it had captured the imaginations of millions there's a species called the petaurus Ajax that the yel paleontologist OC Marsh named in 1877 and it was a relatively incomplete specimen but it was one of these long necked heavy-bodied sorod dinosaurs and the following year his field crew working at a place called KOMO Bluff in Wyoming found another skeleton of a similar dinosaur now back then you know most dinosaurs that were found were very fragmentary there might be as little as a piece of a tooth or part of a bone so if there any difference whatsoever paleontologists like Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker coope based out of Philadelphia they would name a whole new genus or species on the basis of basically the tiniest scrap if it seemed like something new so it's really no surprise that when Marsh got the skeleton of Wyoming that he decided to name it brontosaurus he gave it a different genus name so those two names stayed in the literature for a couple of decades and Along Comes paleontologist Elmer rigs in 1903 he's doing a revision of the sorod dinosaurs he has a look at both of them says you know really these are really really similar they're different species there's Apatosaurus Ajax and there's Apatosaurus excelsus but they're so closely related that there's really no reason to split them out and have a different name so he put that out in the literature on this major monograph in 1903 and nobody cared nobody paid attention to it or if they did they didn't show any sign of it museums kept putting up brontosaurus skeletons they kept naming these dinosaurs brontosaurus illustrators kept putting out brontosaurus illustrations so this was the dinosaur that the public I'd introduce to him because of its size you're dealing with an animal that's you know 60 plus feet long in many Museum exhibits it's absolutely fantastic it's not like anything anyone's ever seen before so you know brontosaurus this dinosaur that should be dead becomes the icon of the Jurassic and for many dinosaurs in general so even though it's in the literature and paleontologists actually know that the proper name is Apatosaurus to most everybody it's still brontosaurus and it's more than just the Brontosaurus to this day we see mistakes in popular culture t-rex still stands upright when we now know his posture was nearly horizontal in Jurassic Park Dilophosaurus had a giant frill and spit poison when there's no evidence of venomous dinosaurs or that dilophosaurs look like that and really in terms of bringing dinosaurs back to life there's nothing better than the movies that you know movies bring dinosaurs back to us in a way that we can really only imagine when the desire to please your fans and the desire to be as accurate to the science as possible science doesn't always want brontosaurus a moving mountain of Flesh and B one of the greatest things about science is that it's always changing based on new evidence but it's hard for us to let go of our emotional ties to what we once knew to be true I have friends who are still bummed that Pluto is no longer classified as a planet it's still there folks it's always lived in the Kyper belt it hasn't gone away just been rebranded if you will same thing with our modern view of the therapod dinosaurs we now know that lots of them were covered in feathers fuzz or fluff the director of Jurassic Park Ford in a very short and Curt tweet said no feathers jp4 now mind you this is about 20 years after paleontologists found some of the first feathery non-avian dinosaurs and we know now birds are dinosaurs many of the traits that we think of as being bird traits you know laying eggs nesting Behavior airs saxs and the skeleton most of all feathers evolved millions and millions and millions of years before amongst the non-avian dinosaurs I mean even Tyrannosaurus Rex itself you know the king of the Tyrant dinosaurs was probably INF fluff to some degree uh but chances are that we're not going to see that in Jurassic Park 4 because fans don't like it because people like me but maybe a little bit misguided people who love their dinosaurs just so very much want a naked Tyrannosaurus they can't deal with the feathers how long do you think it'll take before our romantic vision of the dinosaurs catches up with modern science I say Bring It On You may be surprised to find that when it comes to these incredible Giants of a bygone era truth is often stranger and more fantastic Than Fiction so come on Talk Nerdy To Me

was nearly horizontal in Jurassic Park Dilophosaurus had a giant frill and spit poison when there's no evidence of venomous dinosaurs or that dilophosaurs look like that and really in terms of bringing dinosaurs back to life there's nothing better than the movies that you know movies bring dinosaurs back to us in a way that we can really only imagine when the desire to please your fans and the desire to be as accurate to the science as possible science doesn't always want brontosaurus a moving mountain of Flesh and B one of the greatest things about science is that it's always changing based on new evidence but it's hard for us to let go of our emotional ties to what we once knew to be true I have friends who are still bummed that Pluto is no longer classified as a planet it's still there folks it's always lived in the Kyper belt it hasn't gone away just been rebranded if you will same thing with our modern view of the therapod dinosaurs we now know that lots of them were covered in feathers fuzz or fluff the director of Jurassic Park Ford in a very short and Curt tweet said no feathers jp4 now mind you this is about 20 years after paleontologists found some of the first feathery non-avian dinosaurs and we know now birds are dinosaurs many of the traits that we think of as being bird traits you know laying eggs nesting Behavior airs saxs and the skeleton most of all feathers evolved millions and millions and millions of years before amongst the non-avian dinosaurs I mean even Tyrannosaurus Rex itself you know the king of the Tyrant dinosaurs was probably INF fluff to some degree uh but chances are that we're not going to see that in Jurassic Park 4 because fans don't like it because people like me but maybe a little bit misguided people who love their dinosaurs just so very much want a naked Tyrannosaurus they can't deal with the feathers how long do you think it'll take before our romantic vision of the dinosaurs catches up with modern science I

**Transcript**:
hi everyone Cara Santa Maria here I am a huge dinosaur nerd I love visiting them in museums across the country but in lots of cases the portrayal of these giant beasts is almost as Antiquated as the bones themselves once you put up a dinosaur skeleton it's very very difficult to take it back down again there are actually some very wrong dinosaurs they're still up in a lot of Institutions if you go to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City you'll see dinosaurs that have broken tails and Broken Backs they're still dragging their tails they're still looking as they did in the early 20th century just because it's impossible to remove them from the plaster and from the armatures that they were put on that's Brian suek he's a dinosaur expert and author of my beloved brosaurus the story of a popular culture icon that's warmed the hearts of children for over a century unfortunately brosaurus isn't a real dinosaur scientists began figuring that out over a hundred years ago when Brian first met the mighty brosaurus as a young boy it had been a whopping 80 years since the scientific Community stopped calling it that 80 years but there it was in a Dusty Museum label and all as I was sort of walking by the the Brontosaurus skeleton you know myself just maybe knee high to the dinosaur itself at best I just remember looking up and imagining what it would be like to actually see the animal sort of fleshed out to hear it breathing to see it moving moving you know how this animal actually lived and then when I got home and I started you know looking into uh all the books that I had and you know talking to my teachers about dinosaurs you know I wasn't crushed by it but I found out that brontosaurus wasn't a real dinosaur you know it was this Chimera that uh had come together because of sort of fossil mistakes and you know hypotheses that later turned out to be incorrect it's a classic bone Wars era story The brosaurus is in fact an Apatosaurus but it took scientists a while to realize their mistak stakes and by then it had captured the imaginations of millions there's a species called the petaurus Ajax that the yel paleontologist OC Marsh named in 1877 and it was a relatively incomplete specimen but it was one of these long necked heavy-bodied sorod dinosaurs and the following year his field crew working at a place called KOMO Bluff in Wyoming found another skeleton of a similar dinosaur now back then you know most dinosaurs that were found were very fragmentary there might be as little as a piece of a tooth or part of a bone so if there any difference whatsoever paleontologists like Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker coope based out of Philadelphia they would name a whole new genus or species on the basis of basically the tiniest scrap if it seemed like something new so it's really no surprise that when Marsh got the skeleton of Wyoming that he decided to name it brontosaurus he gave it a different genus name so those two names stayed in the literature for a couple of decades and Along Comes paleontologist Elmer rigs in 1903 he's doing a revision of the sorod dinosaurs he has a look at both of them says you know really these are really really similar they're different species there's Apatosaurus Ajax and there's Apatosaurus excelsus but they're so closely related that there's really no reason to split them out and have a different name so he put that out in the literature on this major monograph in 1903 and nobody cared nobody paid attention to it or if they did they didn't show any sign of it museums kept putting up brontosaurus skeletons they kept naming these dinosaurs brontosaurus illustrators kept putting out brontosaurus illustrations so this was the dinosaur that the public I'd introduce to him because of its size you're dealing with an animal that's you know 60 plus feet long in many Museum exhibits it's absolutely fantastic it's not like anything anyone's ever seen before so you know brontosaurus this dinosaur that should be dead becomes the icon of the Jurassic and for many dinosaurs in general so even though it's in the literature and paleontologists actually know that the proper name is Apatosaurus to most everybody it's still brontosaurus and it's more than just the Brontosaurus to this day we see mistakes in popular culture t-rex still stands upright when we now know his posture

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Zero, a number that indicates an absence of units. In order to understand the genesis of the word zero, we must begin with the very origins of counting. The earliest known archaeological evidence of counting dates back approximately 37,000 years and is merely a series of notches in bone. It wasn't until around 2500 B.C. that the first written number system began to take form in Mesopotamia, using the units one, ten, and sixty. Fast forward another three millennia to seventh century India where mathematicians used a single dot to distinguish between numbers like 25, 205, and 250. Employed as both a placeholder and a number, this all-powerful dot eventually morphed into the symbol we know today. The word zero comes from the Arabic safira, whose literal translation is empty. Passing through Italian as zefiro, zero came into English in the seventeenth century. A second descendant of the Arabic root was adopted into English through old French as the word cipher. Originally sharing the meaning empty with zero, cipher later came to describe a code, as early codes often used complicated substitutions between letters and numbers. From this shared empty origin, zero continues to represent the number that represents nothing.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When and where did the first written numeral system begin to take form?
Options: A. 250,000 years ago in Babylonia, B. 1976 in the United States, C. 2500 BC in Mesopotamia, D. 10,000 years ago in China
Correct Option: C

[Music] the picnic near the lakeside in Chicago is the start of a lazy afternoon early one October we begin with a scene one meter wide which we view from just one meter away now every 10 seconds we will look from 10 times farther away and our field of view will be 10 times wider this square is 10 meters wide and in 10 seconds the next square will be 10 times as wide our picture will center on the picnickers even after they've been lost to sight 100 meters wide the distance a man can run in 10 seconds cars crowd the highway powerboats lie at their docks the colorful bleachers are soldiers filled this square is a kilometer wide 1000 meters the distance a racing car can travel in 10 seconds we see the great city on the lakeshore 10 to the 4th meters 10 kilometers the distance a supersonic airplane can travel in 10 seconds we see first the rounded end of Lake Michigan then the whole great lake 10 to the 5th meters the distance in orbiting satellite covers in 10 seconds long parades of clouds the day's weather in the middle west 10 to the sixth a one with six zeros a million meters soon the earth will show as a solid sphere [Music] we are able to see the whole earth now just over a minutes along the journey earth diminishes into the distance but those background stars are so much farther away if they do not yet appear to move [Laughter] a line extends at the true speed of light in one second at half crosses the Tilted orbit of the moon [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now we mark a small part of the path in which the earth moves about the Sun now the orbital paths of the neighbor planets Venus and Mars then mercury entering our field of view is the glowing center of our solar system the Sun followed by the massive outer planets swinging wide in their big orbits that are orbit belongs to Pluto a fringe of a myriad comets too faint to see completes the solar system [Music] 10 to the 14th as the solar system shrinks to one bright point in the distance our Sun is plainly now only one among the stars looking back from here we note four southern constellations still much as they appear from the far side of the earth [Music] this squares 10 to the 16th meters one light-year not yet out to the next star our last 10 second step took us 10 light-years further the next will be a hundred our perspective changes so much in each step now that even the background stars will appear to converge at last we passed the bright star Arcturus and some stars of the Dipper normal but quite unfamiliar stars and clouds of gas surround us as we traverse the Milky Way galaxy [Music] giant steps carry us into the outskirts of the galaxy and as we pull away we begin to see the great flat spiral facing us the time and path we chose to leave Chicago has brought us out of the galaxy along a course nearly perpendicular to its disk the two little satellite galaxies of our own are the clouds of Magellan 10 to the 22nd power the million light years [Music] groups of galaxies bring a new level of structure to the scene glowing points are no longer single stars but whole galaxies of stars seen as one we pass the big Virgo cluster of galaxies among many others a hundred million light years out as we approach the limit of our vision we pause to start back home this lonely scene the galaxies like dust is what most of space looks like this emptiness is normal the richness of our own neighborhood is the exception the trip back to the picnic on the lakefront will be a sped-up version reducing the distance to the Earth's surface by one power of 10 every 2 seconds in each two seconds will appear to cover 90% the remaining distance back to earth notice the alternation between great activity and relative inactivity a rhythm that will continue all the way into our next goal a proton in the nucleus of a carbon atom beneath the skin on the hand of the sleeping man at the picnic [Music] ten to the ninth meters ten to the eight seven six five four three two one we are back at our starting point we slow up at one meter 10 to the 0 power [Music] now we reduce the distance to our final destination by 90% every 10 seconds each step much smaller than the one before at 10 to the -2 1/100 of a meter 1 centimeter we approach the surface of the hand in a few seconds we were entering the skin crossing layer after layer from the outermost dead cells into a tiny blood vessel within skin layers vanish and turn an outer layer of cells del t collagen the capillary containing red blood cells in a roughly lymphocyte we enter the white cell among its vital organelles the porous wall of the cell nucleus appears the nucleus within holds the heredity of the man in the coiled coils of DNA as we close in we come to the double helix itself a molecule like a long twisted ladder whose rungs of paired bases spell out twice in an alphabet of four letters words of the powerful genetic message at the atomic scale the interplay of form and motion becomes more visible we focus on one commonplace group of three hydrogen atoms bonded by electrical forces to a carbon atom four electrons make up the outer shell of the carbon itself they appear in quantum motion is a swarm of shimmering points at ten to the minus 10 meters one angstrom we find ourselves right among those outer electrons now we come upon the two inner electrons held in a tighter swarm as we draw toward the atoms attracting Center we enter upon a vast inner space at last the carbon nucleus so massive and so small this carbon nucleus is made up of six protons and six neutrons we are in a domain of universal modules there are protons and neutrons in every nucleus electrons in every atom atoms bonded into every molecule out to the farthest galaxies as a single proton fills our scene reach the edge of present understanding are these some quarks that intense interaction our journey has taken us through 40 powers of 10 if now the field is one unit then when we saw many clusters of galaxies together it was 10 to the 40th or 1 and 40 zeroes [Music]

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of cells, although it does not specifically ask about the type of cell entered in the human body.

The most similar generated MCQ is:

Question 9: What is the final destination of the return journey after reaching the edge of the galaxy? Options: A. A proton in the nucleus of a carbon atom, B. An electron in the outer shell of a carbon atom, C. A molecule of DNA, D. A cell nucleus Correct Option: A

This question mentions a cell nucleus, which is related to cells, but it does not specifically ask about the type of cell entered in the human body.

If I had to choose an index, I would say:

Index: 9

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not provide a direct equivalent to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] the picnic near the lakeside in Chicago is the start of a lazy afternoon early one October we begin with a scene one meter wide which we view from just one meter away now every 10 seconds we will look from 10 times farther away and our field of view will be 10 times wider this square is 10 meters wide and in 10 seconds the next square will be 10 times as wide our picture will center on the picnickers even after they've been lost to sight 100 meters wide the distance a man can run in 10 seconds cars crowd the highway powerboats lie at their docks the colorful bleachers are soldiers filled this square is a kilometer wide 1000 meters the distance a racing car can travel in 10 seconds we see the great city on the lakeshore 10 to the 4th meters 10 kilometers the distance a supersonic airplane can travel in 10 seconds we see first the rounded end of Lake Michigan then the whole great lake 10 to the 5th meters the distance in orbiting satellite covers in 10 seconds long parades of clouds the day's weather in the middle west 10 to the sixth a one with six zeros a million meters soon the earth will show as a solid sphere [Music] we are able to see the whole earth now just over a minutes along the journey earth diminishes into the distance but those background stars are so much farther away if they do not yet appear to move [Laughter] a line extends at the true speed of light in one second at half crosses the Tilted orbit of the moon [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now we mark a small part of the path in which the earth moves about the Sun now the orbital paths of the neighbor planets Venus and Mars then mercury entering our field of view is the glowing center of our solar system the Sun followed by the massive outer planets swinging wide in their big orbits that are orbit belongs to Pluto a fringe of a myriad comets too faint to see completes the solar system [Music] 10 to the 14th as the solar system shrinks to one bright point in the distance our Sun is plainly now only one among the stars looking back from here we note four southern constellations still much as they appear from the far side of the earth [Music] this squares 10 to the 16th meters one light-year not yet out to the next star our last 10 second step took us 10 light-years further the next will be a hundred our perspective changes so much in each step now that even the background stars will appear to converge at last we passed the bright star Arcturus and some stars of the Dipper normal but quite unfamiliar stars and clouds of gas surround us as we traverse the Milky Way galaxy [Music] giant steps carry us into the outskirts of the galaxy and as we pull away we begin to see the great flat spiral facing us the time and path we chose to leave Chicago has brought us out of the galaxy along a course nearly perpendicular to its disk the two little satellite galaxies of our own are the clouds of Magellan 10 to the 22nd power the million light years [Music] groups of galaxies bring a new level of structure to the scene glowing points are no longer single stars but whole galaxies of stars seen as one we pass the big Virgo cluster of galaxies among many others a hundred million light years out as we approach the limit of our vision we pause to start back home this lonely scene the galaxies like dust is what most of space looks like this emptiness is normal the richness of our own neighborhood is the exception the trip back to the picnic on the lakefront will be a sped-up version reducing the distance to the Earth's surface by one power of 10 every 2 seconds in each two seconds will appear to cover 90% the remaining distance back to earth notice the alternation between great activity and relative inactivity a rhythm that will continue all the way into our next goal a proton in the nucleus of a carbon atom beneath the skin on the hand of the sleeping man at the picnic [Music] ten to the ninth meters ten to the eight seven six five four three two one we are back at our starting point we slow up at one meter 10 to the 0 power [Music] now we reduce the distance to our final destination by 90% every 10 seconds each step much smaller than the one before at 10 to the -2 1/100 of a meter 1 centimeter we approach the surface of the hand in a few seconds we were entering the skin crossing layer after layer from the outermost dead cells into a tiny blood vessel within skin layers vanish and turn an outer layer of cells del t collagen the capillary containing red blood cells in a roughly lymphocyte we enter the white cell among its vital organelles the porous wall of the cell nucleus appears the nucleus within holds the heredity of the man in the coiled coils of DNA as we close in we come to the double helix itself a molecule like a long twisted ladder whose rungs of paired bases spell out twice in an alphabet of four letters words of the powerful genetic message at the atomic scale the interplay of form and motion becomes more visible we focus on one commonplace group of three hydrogen atoms bonded by electrical forces to a carbon atom four electrons make up the outer shell of the carbon itself they appear in quantum motion is a swarm of shimmering points at ten to the minus 10 meters one angstrom we find ourselves right among those outer electrons now we come upon the two inner electrons held in a tighter swarm as we draw toward the atoms attracting Center we enter upon a vast inner space at last the carbon nucleus so massive and so small this carbon nucleus is made up of six protons and six neutrons we are in a domain of universal modules there are protons and neutrons in every nucleus electrons in every atom atoms bonded into every molecule out to the farthest galaxies as a single proton fills our scene reach the edge of present understanding are these some quarks that intense interaction our journey has taken us through 40 powers of 10 if now the field is one unit then when we saw many clusters of galaxies together it was 10 to the 40th or 1 and 40 zeroes [Music]

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The world we live in is made of things, billions and billions of different things, like pickles and pianos
and dump trucks and octopi. And even though these things
seem totally different, they're all made of the same stuff,
just combined in different ways. To give you an idea
of how this combining works, let's take something apart. Let's start with this bowl
of macaroni salad. If you were to reverse
a recipe for macaroni salad, you'll see it's made by mixing together
a bunch of ingredients, like macaroni, mayo,
vinegar, vegetables, and mustard. This type of combining
is called a mixture. When you make a mixture, you're combining
two or more things together without actually changing
the chemical identity of those things. Like mud, for example. The soil and water in mud
haven't actually changed. They're still soil and water, you've just created
a mixture of soil and water -- mud. It turns out that macaroni salad
is actually a mixture of mixtures because many of the ingredients,
like mayo and mustard, are already mixtures themselves, which is nice for us
because if we look closely, we'll the see the three main types
of mixtures that exist. The size of the particles in a mixture
determines the type of mixture. On one end of the scale is a suspension,
like our muddy water example. You get this if you take
big chunks of something and mix it with something else
so those chunks are just floating around. Take runny mustard for example. You'll see a bunch of little particles like mustard seeds, pepper,
allspice, and minced shallots all floating around in a liquid, in this case vinegar with water. This is called a suspension because you've got particles of one thing
suspended in another. Now, on the other end
of the spectrum is a solution. The particles in this
mixture are so small, they are the actual molecules. A solution is sort of
like a suspension of molecules where one type of molecule
is blended or dissolved with another. Vinegar is an example of a solution where the molecules of acetic acid
are blended with molecules of water. The chemical properties
of the molecules haven't changed, they're just evenly mixed together now. Saltwater and carbonated soda
are both examples of solutions where other molecules
are dissolved in water. The last type of mixture
is called a colloid, which is somewhere
between a suspension and a solution. It's when you take two materials
that don't dissolve and you make the particles so small
that they can't separate. Mayo is what happens
when you take oil and water, which don't mix, and you bind them together, usually with the help
of another substance called an emulsifier. In the case of mayo,
it's lecithin, found in eggs. And now you are left
with really small globs of oil hanging out with really
small droplets of water. Whipped cream, hairspray,
Styrofoam, and Jello are all other examples of colloids. So, let's get back to macaroni salad. You've call colloids like mayo,
suspensions like mustard, and solutions like vinegar, but you've also got celery, shallots,
and all other vegetable chunks that are also part of the salad. These aren't mixtures, really,
but we can break them up, just like a TV can be broken up into smaller and smaller
complex component parts. In the case of vegetables,
if you keep breaking things up, they'll eventually end with thousands
of complex organic molecules, things like ATP synthase and RNA transcriptase and water. So now, once we've unblended
all the solutions, unmixed all the colloids,
separated all the suspensions and taken apart all of our vegetables, we've reached the end
of what we can unmix physically. What we're left with
is a whole bunch of molecules, and these molecules
remain chemically the same whether they are by themselves
or thrown together in a salad. If you want to separate
these guys even further, we need to unmix things chemically, which means we need to start
breaking some bonds.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is not characteristic of a mixture?
Options: A. Two or more elements are combined with one another, B. A chemical change occurs within a mixture, C. Elements in a mixture are combined without creating a chemical reaction, D. All of the above
Correct Option: B

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not directly ask what is not characteristic of a mixture, its correct option (B. Mixture) describes a mixture as the combination of two or more substances without changing their chemical identity. This is closely related to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ (B. A chemical change occurs within a mixture), which states that a chemical change is not characteristic of a mixture.

However, a more accurate match can be found in the content of the generated MCQs. Question 1's description of a mixture aligns with the ground truth MCQ's option C (Elements in a mixture are combined without creating a chemical reaction). 

A more direct match is not available among the generated MCQs, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would recommend Question 5 as the closest match.

Although Question 5 does not directly ask for the three main types of mixtures, it does provide information about one of the types (colloid) and its relation to the other two types (suspension and solution). 

However, if I had to choose a question that could encompass all three types, I would suggest Question 3. It discusses what determines the type of mixture, which could be related to the three main types of mixtures (solution, colloid, suspension) mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

But since neither Question 3 nor Question 5 directly asks for the three main types of mixtures, I must note that there isn't a perfect match among the provided options.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 or 5 (with the caveats mentioned above)

and all other vegetable chunks that are also part of the salad. These aren't mixtures, really,
but we can break them up, just like a TV can be broken up into smaller and smaller
complex component parts. In the case of vegetables,
if you keep breaking things up, they'll eventually end with thousands
of complex organic molecules, things like ATP synthase and RNA transcriptase and water. So now, once we've unblended
all the solutions, unmixed all the colloids,
separated all the suspensions and taken apart all of our vegetables, we've reached the end
of what we can unmix physically. What we're left with
is a whole bunch of molecules, and these molecules
remain chemically the same whether they are by themselves
or thrown together in a salad. If you want to separate
these guys even further, we need to unmix things chemically, which means we need to start
breaking some bonds.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The world we live in is made of things, billions and billions of different things, like pickles and pianos
and dump trucks and octopi. And even though these things
seem totally different, they're all made of the same stuff,
just combined in different ways. To give you an idea
of how this combining works, let's take something apart. Let's start with this bowl
of macaroni salad. If you were to reverse
a recipe for macaroni salad, you'll see it's made by mixing together
a bunch of ingredients, like macaroni, mayo,
vinegar, vegetables, and mustard. This type of combining
is called a mixture. When you make a mixture, you're combining
two or more things together without actually changing
the chemical identity of those things. Like mud, for example. The soil and water in mud
haven't actually changed. They're still soil and water, you've just created
a mixture of soil and water -- mud. It turns out that macaroni salad
is actually a mixture of mixtures because many of the ingredients,
like mayo and mustard, are already mixtures themselves, which is nice for us
because if we look closely, we'll the see the three main types
of mixtures that exist. The size of the particles in a mixture
determines the type of mixture. On one end of the scale is a suspension,
like our muddy water example. You get this if you take
big chunks of something and mix it with something else
so those chunks are just floating around. Take runny mustard for example. You'll see a bunch of little particles like mustard seeds, pepper,
allspice, and minced shallots all floating around in a liquid, in this case vinegar with water. This is called a suspension because you've got particles of one thing
suspended in another. Now, on the other end
of the spectrum is a solution. The particles in this
mixture are so small, they are the actual molecules. A solution is sort of
like a suspension of molecules where one type of molecule
is blended or dissolved with another. Vinegar is an example of a solution where the molecules of acetic acid
are blended with molecules of water. The chemical properties
of the molecules haven't changed, they're just evenly mixed together now. Saltwater and carbonated soda
are both examples of solutions where other molecules
are dissolved in water. The last type of mixture
is called a colloid, which is somewhere
between a suspension and a solution. It's when you take two materials
that don't dissolve and you make the particles so small
that they can't separate. Mayo is what happens
when you take oil and water, which don't mix, and you bind them together, usually with the help
of another substance called an emulsifier. In the case of mayo,
it's lecithin, found in eggs. And now you are left
with really small globs of oil hanging out with really
small droplets of water. Whipped cream, hairspray,
Styrofoam, and Jello are all other examples of colloids. So, let's get back to macaroni salad. You've call colloids like mayo,
suspensions like mustard, and solutions like vinegar, but you've also got celery, shallots,
and all other vegetable chunks that are also part of the salad. These aren't mixtures, really,
but we can break them up, just like a TV can be broken up into smaller and smaller
complex component parts. In the case of vegetables,
if you keep breaking things up, they'll eventually end with thousands
of complex organic molecules, things like ATP synthase and RNA transcriptase and water. So now, once we've unblended
all the solutions, unmixed all the colloids,
separated all the suspensions and taken apart all of our vegetables, we've reached the end
of what we can unmix physically. What we're left with
is a whole bunch of molecules, and these molecules
remain chemically the same whether they are by themselves
or thrown together in a salad. If you want to separate
these guys even further, we need to unmix things chemically, which means we need to start
breaking some bonds.

[Music] [Music] so the awesome story uh it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to Canada my mom left Nairobi Kenya my dad left a small village outside of amzar India and they got here in the late 1960s they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto and they settled into a new life uh they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger um and they had their first kids my sister and I grew up here um and we had quiet happy childhoods uh we had close family good friends and quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like um power always on in our houses uh things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard uh we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old girl is still part of you they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and SM smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a $20 bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last day is authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story um let's go all the way back to 1932 when on a Peanut Farm in Georgia a little baby boy named Rosevelt Greer was born Rosevelt Greer or Rosie Greer as people used to call him grew up and grew into a 300 lb 6'5 linebacker in the NFL he's number 76 in the picture here he is pictured with the Fearsome forsome these are four guys in the LA Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against they were a tough football players doing what they love which was you know crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field um but but Rosie Greer also had another passion um in his deep deeply authentic self he also loved needle point he loved he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying and help them meet chicks that's what he said I mean he loved it so much that after he retired from the NFL he started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so that they could sell it to us for 25 cents I said I don't believe that he's like I don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then I think you'll live a life that is Rich and is satisfying and I think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you

like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old girl is still part of you they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and SM smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a $20 bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last day is authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story um let's go all the way back to 1932 when on a Peanut Farm in Georgia a little baby boy named Rosevelt Greer was born Rosevelt Greer or Rosie Greer as people used to call him grew up and grew into a 300 lb 6'5 linebacker in the NFL he's number 76 in the picture here he is pictured with the Fearsome forsome these are four guys in the LA Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against they were a tough football players doing what they love which was you know crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field um but but Rosie Greer also had another passion um in his deep deeply authentic self he also loved needle point he loved he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying and help them meet chicks that's what he said I mean he loved it so much that after he retired from the NFL he started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so that they could sell it to us for 25 cents I said I don't believe that he's like I don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then I think you'll live a life that is Rich and is satisfying and I think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so the awesome story uh it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to Canada my mom left Nairobi Kenya my dad left a small village outside of amzar India and they got here in the late 1960s they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto and they settled into a new life uh they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger um and they had their first kids my sister and I grew up here um and we had quiet happy childhoods uh we had close family good friends and quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like um power always on in our houses uh things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard uh we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old

we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second day is awareness I love hanging out with three-year-olds I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk I love the way that they'll stare slack jaw at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mid on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hot dogs I love the way that they'll spent hours picking dandelion in the backyard and putting them into a a nice uh centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old because you all used to be 3 years old that three-year-old boy is still part of you that three-year-old girl is still part of you they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and SM smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a $20 bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last day is authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story um let's go all the way back to 1932 when on a Peanut Farm in Georgia a little baby boy named Rosevelt Greer was born Rosevelt Greer or Rosie Greer as people used to call him grew up and grew into a 300 lb 6'5 linebacker in the NFL he's number 76 in the picture here he is pictured with the Fearsome forsome these are four guys in the LA Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against they were a tough football players doing what they love which was you know crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field um but but Rosie Greer also had another passion um in his deep deeply authentic self he also loved needle point he loved he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying and help them meet chicks that's what he said I mean he loved it so much that after he retired from the NFL he started joining clubs and he even put out a book called Rosie Greer's needle point for men and a great cover he's actually if you NOS he's actually needle pointing his own face um and so what I love about this story is that Rosie Greer is just such an authentic person and that's what authenticity is all about it's just about being you and being cool with that and I think when you're authentic you end up following your heart and you put yourself in places and situations and in convers that you love and that you enjoy you meet people that you like talking to you go places you've dreamt about and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled so those are the three A's for the closing thought I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada now I I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid 20s I I don't know because I I never did it but I would imagine that I would take a great attitude I would I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your of your surroundings and appreciating the Small Wonders that you're starting to see in in your new world and I think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to um I'd like to pause my TED talk for about 10 seconds right now uh because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row so I want to ask them to if you don't mind stand up and just I want to say thank you to you guys when I was growing up my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada and um it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto Airport and he was welcomed by a nonprofit Group which I'm sure some in this room runs and and this nonprofit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada and my dad says he got off he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread there was bread there was those little mini dill pickles there was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches there was lasagna there was casseroles there was brownies there was butter tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was I never seen any of that before except bread I didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian I was eating olives with pie you know I just I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here when I was when I was 5 years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would stare and wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they've got an apple here from South Africa can you believe they got a date from Morocco he's like do you know where Morocco even is and I'd say I'm five I don't even know where I am is this A&P um and he'd say I don't know where Morocco is either but let's find out and so we'd buy the date and we'd go home and we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf and we'd flip through it until we found this mysterious country and when we did my dad would say can you believe someone climbed a tree over there picked this thing off it put it in a truck drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so that they could sell it to us for 25 cents I said I don't believe that he's like I don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about and when I stopped and think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about there we are you know the only species on the only lifegiving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things I mean we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes Highway Lanes interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert here's guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and roller coaster rides you can sleep in clean sheets you can get go to the movies and get good seats you can smell Bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap we got all that but we only got a hundred years to enjoy it that's the sad part the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a 100 years life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet and that that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you are right now and that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever Life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three-year-old and seeing the tiny Joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then I think you'll live a life that is Rich and is satisfying and I think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you

[Music] [Music] so the awesome story uh it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to Canada my mom left Nairobi Kenya my dad left a small village outside of amzar India and they got here in the late 1960s they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto and they settled into a new life uh they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger um and they had their first kids my sister and I grew up here um and we had quiet happy childhoods uh we had close family good friends and quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like um power always on in our houses uh things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard uh we grew up and We Grew Older um I went to high school I graduated I moved out of the house I got a job I found a girl I settled down um and I realized it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat Steven song um but uh life was pretty good life was pretty good um 2006 was a great year uh under Clear Blue Skies in July in the wine region of Ontario I got married surrounded by 150 family and friends 2007 was a great year I um graduated from school and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here's a picture of me and my friend Chris um on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them uh and then blocked them with our Giant heads um so you you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking uh believe me um 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher um I know that they were tougher for a lot of people not just me um first of all the news was so heavy uh it's still heavy now and it was Heavy before that but you know when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the TV it was about ice caps melting Wars going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did did collapse and uh so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods 2008 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason too I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time um my marriage wasn't going well and uh we just were growing further and further apart uh one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation um and she said I don't love you anymore and it was um one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard until only a month later when I heard something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose life have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging uh it can be I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night um we talked about the TV show we watched that evening and uh Monday morning I found out that he disappeared uh very sadly he took his own life and it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and I was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow so I came home from work one night and I will logged on to the computer and I started up a tiny website called 1000 awesome things.com I was trying to remind myself of those simple Universal Little Pleasures that we all love we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up the new checkout lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there um and you know slowly over time I started putting myself in a better mood I mean 50,000 blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic did Skyrocket and go up by 100% when she forwarded it to my dad um and then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then Millions started getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then I got a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line said you just won the best blog in the world award I was like that sounds totally fake which uh which African country do you want me to wire all my money to um but turns out um I jumped on a plane and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I went on stage to accept a Webby Award for best blog and the surprise and the you know just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome has now been on number one on the best out list for 20 straight [Music] weeks but look I I said I wanted to do three things today I said I wanted to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the Three A's of awesome and I want to leave you with the closing thought so let's talk about those 3 A's over the last few years I haven't had that much time to really think but lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself you know what is it over the last few years that sort of helped me um grow my website but also grow myself and I've summarize those things for me personally as Three A's um they are attitude awareness and authenticity I'd love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps um none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't going to go according to plan um we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages fatherdaughter dances at weddings and Healthy Babies screeching in the delivery room but between those High highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it's sad and you know it's it's not pleasant to talk about but you know your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or you know your dog could get hit by a car on the street it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes um your mom could get cancer uh your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed down the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl in gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and

you may have heard about the quran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real quranic idea of paradise defined 36 times as gardens watered by running streams since i live in a houseboat on the running stream of lake union this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who've begun reading the quran but given up disconcerted by its otherness the historian thomas carlisle considered muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes yet even he called the quran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearysome confused jumble part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the quran can be read as we usually read a book and so we can curl up with it on this rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as the god and the quran is alien the voice of god speaking to muhammad we're just another author on the bestseller list yet the fact that so few people do actually read the quran is precisely why it's so easy to quote that is to misquote phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti-muslim islamophobes so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the quran properly as properly as i could that is my arabics reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic now i did have an advantage my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the quran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the quran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else's holy book so i read slowly i'd set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it it turned out to be three months i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the quran that feeling of i get it now it is slip away overnight and i'd come back in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very familiar the quran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham moses joseph mary jesus god himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the air i spent wandering the sinai desert and then there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory and i began to grasp why it said that the quran is really the quran only in arabic take the fatiha the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord's prayer in the shmai's hail of islam combined it's just 29 words in arabic but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than red felt more than analyzed it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the quran in english is a kind of shadow of itself or as arthur aubry called his version an interpretation but all is not lost in translation as the quran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises a degree of environmental awareness for instance and of humans as mere stewards of god's creation unmatched in the bible and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men using the second and third person masculine the quran includes women talking for instance of believing men and believing women honorable men and honorable women or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers yes it does say that but in a very specific context the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca where fighting was usually forbidden and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must kill unbelievers in mecca but you can you are allowed to but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba and only if they attack you first and even then god is merciful forgiveness is supreme and so essentially better if you don't was perhaps the biggest surprise how flexible the quran is at least in mind that are not fundamentally inflexible some of these verses are definite in meaning it says and others are ambiguous the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities trying to create the score by pinning down meanings of their own only god knows the true meaning the phrase god is subtle appears again and again and indeed the whole of the quran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe as in for instance that little matter of versions and paradise old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here the word used four times is hurris rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts or as a fair high present virgins yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word who is not a swelling breast or high prism inside now this may be a way of saying pure beings like in angels or it may be like the greek cross or koi and eternal use but the truth is nobody really knows and that's the point because the quran is quite clear when it says that you will be a new creation in paradise and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin and that number 72 never appears there are no 72 virgins in the quran that idea only came into being 300 years later and most islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming hearts paradise is quite the opposite it's not virginity it's fecundity it's plenty it's gardens water by running streams thank you you

was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the air i spent wandering

began to grasp why it said that the quran is really the quran only in arabic take the fatiha the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord's prayer in the shmai's hail of islam combined it's just 29 words in arabic but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than red felt more than analyzed it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the quran in english is a kind of shadow of itself or as arthur aubry called his version an interpretation but all is not lost in translation as the quran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises a degree of environmental awareness for instance and of humans as mere stewards of god's creation unmatched in the bible and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men using the second and third person masculine the quran includes women talking for instance of believing men and believing women honorable men and honorable women or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers yes it does say that but in a very specific context the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca where fighting was usually forbidden and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must kill unbelievers in mecca but you can you are allowed to but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba and only if they attack you first and even then god is merciful forgiveness is supreme and so essentially better if you don't was perhaps the biggest surprise how flexible the quran is at least in mind that are not fundamentally inflexible some of these verses are definite in meaning it says and others are ambiguous the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities trying to create the score by pinning down meanings of their own only god knows the true meaning the phrase god is subtle appears again and again and indeed the whole of the quran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe as in for instance that little matter of versions and paradise old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here the word used four times is hurris rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts or as a fair high present virgins yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word who is not a swelling breast or high prism inside now this may be a way of saying pure beings like in angels or it may be like the greek cross or koi and eternal use but the truth is nobody really knows and that's the point because the quran is quite clear when it says that you will be a new creation in paradise and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin and that number 72 never appears there are no 72 virgins in the quran that idea only came into being 300 years later and most islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming hearts paradise is quite the opposite it's not virginity it's fecundity it's plenty it's gardens water by

**Transcript**:
you may have heard about the quran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real quranic idea of paradise defined 36 times as gardens watered by running streams since i live in a houseboat on the running stream of lake union this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who've begun reading the quran but given up disconcerted by its otherness the historian thomas carlisle considered muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes yet even he called the quran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearysome confused jumble part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the quran can be read as we usually read a book and so we can curl up with it on this rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as the god and the quran is alien the voice of god speaking to muhammad we're just another author on the bestseller list yet the fact that so few people do actually read the quran is precisely why it's so easy to quote that is to misquote phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti-muslim islamophobes so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the quran properly as properly as i could that is my arabics reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic now i did have an advantage my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the quran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the quran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else's holy book so i read slowly i'd set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it it turned out to be three months i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the quran that feeling of i get it now it is slip away overnight and i'd come back in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very

have you recently had the feeling there is more to do than you can achieve in a day a week or even a month a good time management strategy solves this problem and can dramatically reduce stress and increase your own productivity at the same time the Eisenhower matrix by former US President Eisenhower supports you in prioritizing tasks by urgency and importance and sorting out those less urgent or important tasks which you shouldn't do yourself this results in four quadrants with different work strategies we call the first quadrant that do first sector as its tasks are important for your life and career and need to be done today or tomorrow the latest you could use a timer to help you concentrate while trying to get as much of them done as possible an example of a number one task could be a review of an important document for your manager the second quadrant we call the schedule sector as its tasks are important but less urgent and you should list those things that you need to put in your calendar here an example of that could be a long-planned return to the gym the third quadrant takes up things you could delegate as they are less important to you than others but still pretty urgent you should keep track of delegated tasks by email telephone or within a meeting to check back on their progress later an example of a delegation could be somebody calling you and asking for an urgent favor or requesting you step into a meeting maybe you could delegate this responsibility by suggesting a better person for the job or give the necessary information back to the caller and have him deal with the matter himself the fourth and last quadrant is there to help you sort out and eliminate the things that you really shouldn't do at all discover and stop bad habits like surfing the internet without a reason or other forms of procrastination like gaming too long just to find an excuse for not being able to deal with important tasks in the first and second quadrant and that's it give it a try yourself or head on over to Eisenhower dot me for more information and don't forget as Dwight Eisenhower once said what's important is seldom urgent and what's urgent is seldom important

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Bewilder, to confuse or puzzle completely. The root of the word bewilder can be traced back to the Old English word wilde, which was used to refer to something that was in a natural state, uncultivated, or undomesticated. Over time, the word wild was often linked to the Old English word deor. Deor, which was derived from an early Indo-European root that meant breathe, was initially used to describe any untamed animal or beast. This eventually morphed into the modern word deer, meaning a ruminant of the family Cervidae. The two Old English words, when mashed together, became wilderness, meaning a tract of uncultivated land, primarily inhabited by undomesticated beasts. From the word wilderness, the word wilder was born. To wilder someone was to lead him astray or lure him into the woods. In the 1600's, the prefix be, meaning thoroughly, was compounded with wilder as a way of tacking on a little extra punch. Someone who was bewildered was thoroughly lost in the wild. From this winding background, bewilder eventually evolved into our current definition, to be completely confused.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What does it mean to wilder someone?

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels and to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation 17 doesn't divide by two it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly temper started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had 18 camels the first son took his half half of 18 is nine the second son took his third a third of 18 is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of 18 is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like 17 camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel now finding that 18th camel in the world's conflict has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all 15 000 tribes are in touch with each other and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light there's a lot of conflict and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it's maybe our one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us it's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give you just a story an example about 20 years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time living with several groups of son bushmen i was curious about them about the way in which they resolved conflict because after all their within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives there's a cooling off period well that system is i think probably a system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it there's always two sides you know it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he went on and he turned to me and said you're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we're here to do just to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering in the bloodshed in chechnya the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict and the most impossible conflict is the middle east question is where's the third side there how could we possibly go to the balcony now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he went on and he turned to me and said you're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we're here to do just to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering in the bloodshed in chechnya the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict and the most impossible conflict is the middle east question is where's the third side there how could we possibly go to the balcony now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels and to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation 17 doesn't divide by two it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly temper started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had 18 camels the first son took his half half of 18 is nine the second son took his third a third of 18 is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of 18 is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like 17 camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel now finding that 18th camel in the world's conflict has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all 15 000 tribes are in touch with each other and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light there's a lot of conflict and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it's maybe our one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us it's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give you just a story an example about 20 years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time living with several groups of son bushmen i was curious about them about the way in which they resolved conflict because after all their within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives there's a cooling off period well that system is i think probably a system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it there's always two sides you know it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels and to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation 17 doesn't divide by two it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly temper started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had 18 camels the first son took his half half of 18 is nine the second son took his third a third of 18 is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of 18 is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like 17 camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel now finding that 18th camel in the world's conflict has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all 15 000 tribes are in touch with each other and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light there's a lot of conflict and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it's maybe our one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us it's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give you just a story an example about 20 years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time living with several groups of son bushmen i was curious about them about the way in which they resolved conflict because after all their within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives there's a cooling off period well that system is i think probably a system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it there's always two sides you know it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake you know for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings were reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he went on and he turned to me and said you're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we're here to do just to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering in the bloodshed in chechnya the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict and the most impossible conflict is the middle east question is where's the third side there how could we possibly go to the balcony now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are 100 times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews religious or non-religious we feel we have a personal stake in it stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to transmit knowledge to give meaning to our lives that's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story let's try to get at the root of what it's all about let's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story what's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value was respect was kindness towards strangers that's what he's known for is hospitality so in that sense he's the symbolic third side of the middle east he's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment we today we face a scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be actually an ant because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story that's powerful but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story how would you do that and that was my thinking of how would you do that and that's what comes to the first step here because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human walking it's funny when you walk you walk side by side in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights why they walk that's why negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham people said that's crazy you can't you can't retrace the footsteps of abraham that's too insecure you get across all these borders it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence and then a few years ago a group of us about 25 of us from 10 different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his original birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to haran where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem and finally to the place where he's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you ever had that experience that's the essence of of the abraham path but that's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he's alive he's a living presence and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham in the middle east enjoying the hospitality of the people there they've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in syria it's an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and then all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it uh last month there was a piece in the in the guardian uh in the manchester guardian uh about it two two whole pages uh and they quoted a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money and this woman right here um is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids but what she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a tablecloth she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kind of communities across the middle east across the path the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense the abraham path is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its early phase what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe if you had been in the ruins of say london in 1945 or berlin and you had said 60 years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is if it could be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism so let me conclude then by saying that in the last 35 years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them that's a third side act that's walking abraham's path after a ted talk why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant worldclass neuropsychologist I had a baby and that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant world-class neuropsychologist sorry Ted uh but I did go on to be a reasonably astute arguably world-class worrier one of my girlfriends in graduate school Marie said Kim I figured it out it's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full disclosure I brought some pictures to share oh I'll just say [Laughter] July zip for safety water wings an inch of water and then finally all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain so uh you could get kind of a feel for this so my baby Vander is eight years old now and uh despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer he's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would I worry because this is what I do this is what I teach it's what I study it's what I treat and I know that kids get concussed every year in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell wrong but what is it that we're really talking about let's take a look all right starski and Hutch arguably yes uh so a car accident 40 miles an hour into a fixed barrier 35 G's a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face 58 G in case you missed it we'll look again so look to the right hand side of the screen what would you say how many G's close 72 would it be crazy to know know 103 G's the average concussive impact is 95 G's now when the kid on the right doesn't get up right we know they've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them the definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness it requires only a change in Consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear being more impulsive or hostile than usual so given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am how do I get any sleep at all cuz I know our brains are resilient they're designed to recover from an injury if God forbid any of us left here tonight and sustain concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college H peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free Baseline after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there their risk for third injury greater still and so on and here's the really alarming part we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries you guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL uh in a nutshell This research suggests that among retired HED NFL players with three or more career concussions the incidence of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population so you've all seen that New York Times you've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car from the driveway so I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday so uh how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can we 100 % guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what I've come up [Laughter] with if only my little boy's right there and he's like she's not kidding she's totally not kidding so uh in all seriousness should my kid play football should your kid play football I don't know but I do know there are three things you can do the first study up you have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today there are some great resources out there the CDC has a program heads up it's at cdc.gov heads up is specific to concussion and kids the second is a resource I'm personally really proud of we've just rolled this out in the last couple months co- kids with brain injury this is a great resource for student athletes teachers parents professionals athletic and coaching staff it's a great place to start if you have questions the second thing is speak up just two weeks ago a bill introduced by Senator Cales that would have required athletes kids under 18 to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee it died in large part because it lacked constituent buyin it lacked stakeholder traction now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support but I am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that speak up also with coaching staff ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what's the budget for protective equipment how old is it maybe offered to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear which brings us to suit up wear a helmet the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening recently one of my graduate students Tom Tom said Kim I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class and uh Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the GeForce of impact by half now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet Crusade right this epiphany of Tom's as it turns out it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education so should Vander play football I can't say no but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet like to the car or at school so whether athlete scholar overprotected kid neurotic mom or otherwise here's my baby Vander reminding you to mind your matter thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant worldclass neuropsychologist I had a baby and that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant world-class neuropsychologist sorry Ted uh but I did go on to be a reasonably astute arguably world-class worrier one of my girlfriends in graduate school Marie said Kim I figured it out it's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full disclosure I brought some pictures to share oh I'll just say [Laughter] July zip for safety water wings an inch of water and then finally all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain so uh you could get kind of a feel for this so my baby Vander is eight years old now and uh despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer he's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would I worry because this is what I do this is what I teach it's what I study it's what I treat and I know that kids get concussed every year in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell wrong but what is it that we're really talking about let's take a look all right starski and Hutch arguably yes uh so a car accident 40 miles an hour into a fixed barrier 35 G's a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face 58 G in case you missed it we'll look again so look to the right hand side of the screen what would you say how many G's close 72 would it be crazy to know know 103 G's the average concussive impact is 95 G's now when the kid on the right doesn't get up right we know they've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them the definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness it requires only a change in Consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear being more impulsive or hostile than usual so given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am how do I get any sleep at all cuz I know our brains are resilient they're designed to recover from an injury if God forbid any of us left here tonight and sustain concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college H peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free Baseline after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there their risk for third injury greater still and so on and here's the really alarming part we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries you guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL uh in a nutshell This research suggests that among retired HED NFL players with three or more career concussions the incidence of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population so you've all seen that New York Times you've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car from the driveway so I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday so uh how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can we 100 % guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what I've come up [Laughter] with if only my little boy's right there and he's like she's not kidding she's totally not kidding so uh in all seriousness should my kid play football should your kid play football I don't know but I do know there are three things you can do the first study up you have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today there are some great resources out there the CDC has a program heads up it's at cdc.gov heads up is specific to concussion and kids the second is a resource I'm personally really proud of we've just rolled this out in the last couple months co- kids with brain injury this is a great resource for student athletes teachers parents professionals athletic and coaching staff it's a great place to start if you have questions the second thing is speak up just two weeks ago a bill introduced by Senator Cales that would have required athletes kids under 18 to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee it died in large part because it lacked constituent buyin it lacked stakeholder traction now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support but I am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that speak up also with coaching staff ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what's the budget for protective equipment how old is it maybe offered to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear which brings us to suit up wear a helmet the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening recently one of my graduate students Tom Tom said Kim I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class and uh Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the GeForce of impact by half now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet Crusade right this epiphany of Tom's as it turns out it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education so should Vander play football I can't say no but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet like to the car or at school so whether athlete scholar overprotected kid neurotic mom or otherwise here's my baby Vander reminding you to mind your matter thank [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects. And by August 1957, the Soviet's successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7, the same rocket that would be used to launch Sputnik two months later. So, the scary thing about Sputnik was not the orbiting ball itself, but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city. Not wanting to fall too far behind, President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up its own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible. So, on December 6, 1957, excited people across the nation tuned in to watch the live broadcast as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off and crashed to the ground two seconds later. The Vanguard failure was a huge embarassment for the United States. Newspapers printed headlines like, "Flopnik" and "Kaputnik." And a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mockingly suggested that the U.S. should receive foreign aid for developing nations. Fortunately, the Army had been working on their own parallel project, The Explorer, which was successfully launched in January 1958, but the U.S. had barely managed to catch up before they were surpassed again as Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961. Almost a year passed and several more Soviet astronauts completed their missions before Project Mercury succeeded in making John Glenn the first American in orbit in February 1962. By this time, President Kennedy had realized that simply catching up to each Soviet advance a few months later wasn't going to cut it. The U.S. had to do something first, and in May 1961, a month after Gargarin's flight, he announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. They succeeded in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step on July 20, 1969. With both countries' next turning their attention to orbital space stations, there's no telling how much longer the space race could have gone on. But because of improving relations negotiated by Soviet Premier Leonid Breshnev and U.S. President Nixon, the U.S.S.R. and U.S. moved toward cooperation rather than competition. The successful joint mission, known as Apollo-Soyuz, in which an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft and the two crews met, shook hands, and exchanged gifts, marked the end of the space race in 1975. So, in the end, what was the point of this whole space race? Was it just a massive waste of time? Two major superpowers trying to outdo each other by pursuing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive, using resources that could have been better spent elsewhere? Well, sure, sort of, but the biggest benefits of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another. During the space race, funding for research and education, in general, increased dramatically, leading to many advances that may not have otherwise been made. Many NASA technologies developed for space are now widely used in civilian life, from memory foam in mattresses to freeze-dried food, to LEDs in cancer treatment. And, of course, the satellites that we rely on for our GPS and mobile phone signals would not have been there without the space program. All of which goes to show that the rewards of scientific research and advancement are often far more vast than even the people pursuing them can imagine.

**Transcript**:
On October 4, 1957, the world watched in awe and fear as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, into space. This little metal ball, smaller than two feet in diameter, launched a space race between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that would last for eighteen years and change the world as we know it. Sputnik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space. That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort in the final years of World War II. It wasn't very effective, but, at the end of the war, both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects. And by August 1957, the Soviet's successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7, the same rocket that would be used to launch Sputnik two months later. So, the scary thing about Sputnik was not the orbiting ball itself, but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city. Not wanting to fall too far behind, President Eisenhower ordered the Navy to speed up its own project and launch a satellite as soon as possible. So, on December 6, 1957, excited people across the nation tuned in to watch the live broadcast as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off and crashed to the ground two seconds later. The Vanguard failure was a huge embarassment for the United States. Newspapers printed headlines like, "Flopnik" and "Kaputnik." And a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mockingly suggested that the U.S. should receive foreign aid for developing nations. Fortunately, the Army had been working on their own parallel project, The Explorer, which was successfully launched in January 1958, but the U.S. had barely managed to catch up before they were surpassed again as Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961. Almost a year passed and several more Soviet astronauts completed their missions before Project Mercury succeeded in making John Glenn the first American in orbit in February 1962. By this time, President Kennedy had realized that simply catching up to each Soviet advance a few months later wasn't going to cut it. The U.S. had to do something first, and in May 1961, a month after Gargarin's flight, he announced the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. They succeeded in this through the Apollo program with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step on July 20, 1969. With both countries' next turning their attention to orbital space stations, there's no telling how much longer the space race could have gone on. But because of improving relations negotiated by Soviet Premier Leonid Breshnev and U.S. President Nixon, the U.S.S.R. and U.S. moved toward cooperation rather than competition. The successful joint mission, known as Apollo-Soyuz, in which an American Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft and the two crews met, shook hands, and exchanged gifts, marked the end of the space race in 1975. So, in the end, what was the point of this whole space race? Was it just a massive waste of time? Two major superpowers trying to outdo each other by pursuing symbolic projects that were both dangerous and expensive, using resources that could have been better spent elsewhere? Well, sure, sort of, but the biggest benefits of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another. During the space race, funding for research and education, in general, increased dramatically, leading to many advances that may not have otherwise been made. Many NASA technologies developed for space are now widely used in civilian life, from memory foam in mattresses to freeze-dried food, to LEDs in cancer treatment. And, of course, the satellites that we rely on for our GPS and mobile phone signals would not have been there without the space program. All of which goes to show that the rewards of scientific research and advancement are often far more vast than even the people pursuing them can imagine.

**Transcript**:
You can think of your cells as the kitchen in a busy restaurant. Sometimes your body orders chicken. Other times, it orders steak. Your cells have to be able to crank out whatever the body needs and quickly. When an order comes in, the chef looks to the cookbook, your DNA, for the recipe. She then transcribes that message onto a piece of paper called RNA and brings it back to her countertop, the ribosome. There, she can translate the recipe into a meal, or for your cells, a protein, by following the directions that she's copied down. But RNA does more for the cell than just act as a messenger between a cook and her cookbook. It can move in reverse and create DNA, it can direct amino acids to their targets, or it can take part in RNA interference, or RNAi. But wait! Why would RNA want to interfere with itself? Well, sometimes a cell doesn't want to turn all of the messenger RNA it creates into protein, or it may need to destroy RNA injected into the cell by an attacking virus. Say, for example, in our cellular kitchen, that someone wanted to cancel their order or decided they wanted chips instead of fries. That's where RNAi comes in. Thankfully, your cells have the perfect knives for just this kind of job. When the cell finds or produces long, double-stranded RNA molecules, it chops these molecules up with a protein actually named dicer. Now, these short snippets of RNA are floating around in the cell, and they're picked up by something called RISC, the RNA Silencing Complex. It's composed of a few different proteins, the most important being slicer. This is another aptly named protein, and we'll get to why in just a second. RISC strips these small chunks of double-stranded RNA in half, using the single strand to target matching mRNA, looking for pieces that fit together like two halves of a sandwich. When it finds the matching piece of mRNA, RISC's slicer protein slices it up. The cell then realizes there are odd, strangely sized pieces of RNA floating around and destroys them, preventing the mRNA from being turned into protein. So, you have double-stranded RNA, you dice it up, it targets mRNA, and then that gets sliced up, too. Voila! You've prevented expression and saved yourself some unhappy diners. So, how did anybody ever figure this out? Well, the process was first discovered in petunias when botanists trying to create deep purple blooms introduced a pigment-producing gene into the flowers. But instead of darker flowers, they found flowers with white patches and no pigment at all. Instead of using the RNA produced by the new gene to create more pigment, the flowers were actually using it to knock down the pigment-producing pathway, destroying RNA from the plant's original genes with RNAi, and leaving them with pigment-free white flowers. Scientists saw a similar phenomena in tiny worms called C. elegans, and once they figured out what was happening, they realized they could use RNAi to their advantage. Want to see what happens when a certain gene is knocked out of a worm or a fly? Introduce an RNAi construct for that gene, and bam! No more protein expression. You can even get creative and target that effect to certain systems, knocking down genes in just the brain, or just the liver, or just the heart. Figuring out what happens when you knock down a gene in a certain system can be an important step in figuring out what that gene does. But RNAi isn't just for understanding how things happen. It can also be a powerful, therapeutic tool and could be a way for us to manipulate what is happening within own cells. Researchers have been experimenting with using it to their advantage in medicine, including targeting RNA and tumor cells in the hopes of turning off cancer-causing genes. In theory, our cellular kitchens could serve up an order of cells, hold the cancer.

**Transcript**:
You can think of your cells as the kitchen in a busy restaurant. Sometimes your body orders chicken. Other times, it orders steak. Your cells have to be able to crank out whatever the body needs and quickly. When an order comes in, the chef looks to the cookbook, your DNA, for the recipe. She then transcribes that message onto a piece of paper called RNA and brings it back to her countertop, the ribosome. There, she can translate the recipe into a meal, or for your cells, a protein, by following the directions that she's copied down. But RNA does more for the cell than just act as a messenger between a cook and her cookbook. It can move in reverse and create DNA, it can direct amino acids to their targets, or it can take part in RNA interference, or RNAi. But wait! Why would RNA want to interfere with itself? Well, sometimes a cell doesn't want to turn all of the messenger RNA it creates into protein, or it may need to destroy RNA injected into the cell by an attacking virus. Say, for example, in our cellular kitchen, that someone wanted to cancel their order or decided they wanted chips instead of fries. That's where RNAi comes in. Thankfully, your cells have the perfect knives for just this kind of job. When the cell finds or produces long, double-stranded RNA molecules, it chops these molecules up with a protein actually named dicer. Now, these short snippets of RNA are floating around in the cell, and they're picked up by something called RISC, the RNA Silencing Complex. It's composed of a few different proteins, the most important being slicer. This is another aptly named protein, and we'll get to why in just a second. RISC strips these small chunks of double-stranded RNA in half, using the single strand to target matching mRNA, looking for pieces that fit together like two halves of a sandwich. When it finds the matching piece of mRNA, RISC's slicer protein slices it up. The cell then realizes there are odd, strangely sized pieces of RNA floating around and destroys them, preventing the mRNA from being turned into protein. So, you have double-stranded RNA, you dice it up, it targets mRNA, and then that gets sliced up, too. Voila! You've prevented expression and saved yourself some unhappy diners. So, how did anybody ever figure this out? Well, the process was first discovered in petunias when botanists trying to create deep purple blooms introduced a pigment-producing gene into the flowers. But instead of darker flowers, they found flowers with white patches and no pigment at all. Instead of using the RNA produced by the new gene to create more pigment, the flowers were actually using it to knock down the pigment-producing pathway, destroying RNA from the plant's original genes with RNAi, and leaving them with pigment-free white flowers. Scientists saw a similar phenomena in tiny worms called C. elegans, and once they figured out what was happening, they realized they could use RNAi to their advantage. Want to see what happens when a certain gene is knocked out of a worm or a fly? Introduce an RNAi construct for that gene, and bam! No more protein expression. You can even get creative and target that effect to certain systems, knocking down genes in just the brain, or just the liver, or just the heart. Figuring out what happens when you knock down a gene in a certain system can be an important step in figuring out what that gene does. But RNAi isn't just for understanding how things happen. It can also be a powerful, therapeutic tool and could be a way for us to manipulate what is happening within own cells. Researchers have been experimenting with using it to their advantage in medicine, including targeting RNA and tumor cells in the hopes of turning off cancer-causing genes. In theory, our cellular kitchens could serve up an order of cells, hold the cancer.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] we are here today because United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries they're called Millennium Development Goals and the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them and by specifying eight different goals the United Nations have said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get a good life for people look here you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspects from aid to trade there's a second reason I like these Development Goals and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality the aim here is to reduce child mortality with two thirds from 1990 to 2050 that's a 4% reduction per year and this with measuring that's what make the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people and what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia in Middle East in Latin America and East Europe that is reducing with this rate and even my T Brazil is going down with 5% per year and Turkey with 7% per year so there's good news but then I hear people saying there is no progress in Africa and there's not even statistics in Africa to know what is happening I'll prove them wrong on both points come with me to the wonderful world of statistic I bring you to the webpage child mortality dot or you know where you can bag deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it's done by UN specialists you know and I will take Kenya as an example here you see the data don't panic now don't panic you know I'll help you through this it looks you know nasty like in in in college when you did like statistics man but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself from where do the date that come what is the origin of the data is it so that in Kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of a child and it's sent to the Statistical Office no low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization it exists but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family and it's not registered so what we rely on is not incomplete system we have interviews we have surveys and in this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and Oscar about birth history how many children did you have order you're alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what you used to be called a demographic Health Survey report but these surveys are costly so they can only be done with three to five years interval but they have good quality so this is this is a limitation and all these colored lines here are results each color is one serving but that's too complicated for today so I'll simplified for you and I give you one average point for each survey this was 1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when the expert in the UN have got these service in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and trend line and the trend line looks like this see here is the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing and they estimated that 2008 Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I was sad because we could see this this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic but in June I got the mail in my inbox from demographic Health Survey and it showed good news from Kenya I was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey then it just took another three months for you and to get it into their server and on Friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn't it nice isn't it nice yeah I was actually on Friday sitting in front of my computer and I saw that the death rate fall from 128 to 84 yes that morning you know so we celebrated but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress I'm going into some details here because you n do it like this they start 1992 they measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no progress that's unfair as a professor I think I have the right to propose something differently I would say at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend it's to two surveys and you can see what's happening now they have 2.4 percent had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya I may have joined these two points so what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality we have a decent trend it coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs and the reason here for Africa is especially important because 90s was a bad decade not only in Kenya but across Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was resistant for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got late to the mosquito netting and there were socio-economic problems which are now being solved at the much better scale so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub-saharan Africa and UN says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent now this sounds a little theoretical but it's not so theoretically you know these economists they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of economy we in public health we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it's sort of the same percentage if your economy grow with 4% you ought to reduce child mortality with 4% if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want so so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years and economists would never do that I have just divided into two period in the 90s only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent whereas now second gear is like Africa had first gear now they go into second gear but even this is not a fair representation of Africa because it's an average it's an average speed of reduction in Africa and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs still here child F per 1000 on that axis here we have year and I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries I give you Congo which was high Ghana lower and Kenya even lower and what has happened over the years since there here we go you can see with independence literacy improved you know and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene was improved and things got better but then in the eighties watch out here Congo got into civil war and they leveled off fear Ghana got very help fast this was the backlash in Kenya and go on a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down together still the standstill in Congo that's why we are today you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this serie improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one place that their countries are so different and they married to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about Europe as one place I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different everyone knows that and they are judged each country on how they are doing you know so so let me show the why the picture my country Sweden 1800 we were up there what the strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate it's very strange it's sort of embarrassing but we had that habit in Sweden you know that we counted all the child that's even if we didn't do anything about it and then you see these are famine years this was bad years and people got fed up with freedom my ancestors moved to the United States you know and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service and child mortality came though we never had a war Sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary school actually starting 1842 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later you have to realise that the investments we do in progress for long term investments is not about just five years it's long term investments and and and Sweden never reach Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1 percent when I calculate so we are off track that was Sweden is but you don't talk about it so much you know we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you Thailand see what a success story in Thailand from the 1960s how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels of Sweden and I'll give you another story Egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health he just was up here 1960 higher than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease you know and and malaria and a lot of problem and then they got the Aswan Dam they got electricity in the homes the increased education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible and the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did as it fastest you know Kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill now let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality I'm going to show you the relation between child mortality on this axis here this here is child mortality and here I have the family size the relation between child mortality and family size one two three four children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see the continent the dark blue here is sub-saharan Africa you know and the size of the bubble is the population and these are the so called developing countries they had high or very high child mortality and family size six to eight and and and the ones over there they were the so called Western countries they had low child mortality and small families what has happened what I want you now is to see with your own eyes the relation between falling child mortality and decrease in family size I just want not have any ruby has to see that for yourself this is what happened now I start the world here we come down with their educational smallpox better education you know health service it got on there China comes Indian to the Western box here you know and here Brazil is in the west of all India's approach' the first African countries coming into the Western ball and we get a lot of new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down here this is the vision we have isn't it and look now the African the first African countries here are coming in there we are today there is no such thing as a Western world and developing world this is the this is the report from UN which came out on Friday it's very good levels and Friends and child mortality except this page this page is very bad it's the categorization of countries it labels developing countries I can read from the listed developing countries Republic of Korea South Korea now they get some some how can they be developing countries they have here Singapore that the lowest child mortality in the world is Singapore they bypass Sweden and five years ago and they are label developing country they have here guitar it's a richest country in the world with aljazeera how the heck could they be developing this is crap the rest there is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fit to the data you know and we have to realize that we are all going to live into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look even if we look in Africa these are the African countries you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size even within Africa it's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health metrics and evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50% of the fallen child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we got get girls in school we will get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong that's why we must have that long-term perspective but we must measure the impact over ten years period it's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down into the corner why we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter or actor most important from humanitarian aspects it's a decent life for children we are talking about but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population let's be clear about that and the way to do that that is to get child mortality down get access to family planning and behind that a drive of female education and that is fully possible let's do it thank you very much you [Music]

that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different everyone knows that and they are judged each country on how they are doing you know so so let me show the why the picture my country Sweden 1800 we were up there what the strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate it's very strange it's sort of embarrassing but we had that habit in Sweden you know that we counted all the child that's even if we didn't do anything about it and then you see these are famine years this was bad years and people got fed up with freedom my ancestors moved to the United States you know and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service and child mortality came though we never had a war Sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary school actually starting 1842 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later you have to realise that the investments we do in progress for long term investments is not about just five years it's long term investments and and and Sweden never reach Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1 percent when I calculate so we are off track that was Sweden is but you don't talk about it so much you know we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you Thailand see what a success story in Thailand from the 1960s how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels of Sweden and I'll give you another story Egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health he just was up here 1960 higher than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease you know and and malaria and a lot of problem and then they got the Aswan Dam they got electricity in the homes the increased education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible and the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did as it fastest you know Kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill now let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality I'm going to show you the relation between child mortality on this axis here this here is child mortality and here I have the family size the relation between child mortality and family size one two three four children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see the continent the dark blue here is sub-saharan Africa you know and the size of the bubble is the population and these are the so called developing countries they had high or very high child mortality and family size six to eight and and and the ones over there they were the so called Western countries they had low child mortality and small families what has happened what I want you now is to see with your own eyes the relation between falling child mortality and decrease in family size I just want not have any ruby has to see that for yourself this is what happened now I start the world here we come down with their educational smallpox better education you know health service it got on there China comes Indian to the Western box here you know and here Brazil is in the west of all India's approach' the first African countries coming into the Western ball and we get a lot of new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down here this is the vision we have isn't it and look now the African the first African countries here are coming in there we are today there is no such thing as a Western world and developing world this is the this is the report from UN which came out on Friday it's very good levels and Friends and child mortality except this page this page is very bad it's the categorization of countries it labels developing countries I can read from the listed developing countries Republic of Korea South Korea now they get some some how can they be developing countries they have here Singapore that the lowest child mortality in the world is Singapore they bypass Sweden and five years ago and they are label developing country they have here guitar it's a richest country in the world with aljazeera how the heck could they be developing this is crap the rest there is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fit to the data you know and we have to realize that we are all going to live into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look even if we look in Africa these are the African countries you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size even within Africa it's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health metrics and evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50% of the fallen child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we got get girls in school we will get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong that's why we must have that long-term perspective but we must measure the impact over ten years period it's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down into the corner why we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter or actor most important from humanitarian aspects it's a decent life for children we are talking about but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population let's be clear about that and the way to do that that is to get child mortality down get access to family planning and behind that a drive of female education and that is fully possible let's do it thank you very much you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] we are here today because United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries they're called Millennium Development Goals and the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them and by specifying eight different goals the United Nations have said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get a good life for people look here you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspects from aid to trade there's a second reason I like these Development Goals and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality the aim here is to reduce child mortality with two thirds from 1990 to 2050 that's a 4% reduction per year and this with measuring that's what make the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people and what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia in Middle East in Latin America and East Europe that is reducing with this rate and even my T Brazil is going down with 5% per year and Turkey with 7% per year so there's good news but then I hear people saying there is no progress in Africa and there's not even statistics in Africa to know what is happening I'll prove them wrong on both points come with me to the wonderful world of statistic I bring you to the webpage child mortality dot or you know where you can bag deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it's done by UN specialists you know and I will take Kenya as an example here you see the data don't panic now don't panic you know I'll help you through this it looks you know nasty like in in in college when you did like statistics man but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself from where do the date that come what is the origin of the data is it so that in Kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of a child and it's sent to the Statistical Office no low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization it exists but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family and it's not registered so what we rely on is not incomplete system we have interviews we have surveys and in this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and Oscar about birth history how many children did you have order you're alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what you used to be called a demographic Health Survey report but these surveys are costly so they can only be done with three to five years interval but they have good quality so this is this is a limitation and all these colored lines here are results each color is one serving but that's too complicated for today so I'll simplified for you and I give you one average point for each survey this was 1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when the expert in the UN have got these service in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and trend line and the trend line looks like this see here is the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing and they estimated that 2008 Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I was sad because we could see this this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic but in June I got the mail in my inbox from demographic Health Survey and it showed good news from Kenya I was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey then it just took another three months for you and to get it into their server and on Friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn't it nice isn't it nice yeah I was actually on Friday sitting in front of my computer and I saw that the death rate fall from 128 to 84 yes that morning you know so we celebrated but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress I'm going into some details here because you n do it like this they start 1992 they measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no progress that's unfair as a professor I think I have the right to propose something differently I would say at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend it's to two surveys and you can see what's happening now they have 2.4 percent had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya I may have joined these two points so what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality we have a decent trend it coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs and the reason here for Africa is especially important because 90s was a bad decade not only in Kenya but across Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was resistant for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got late to the mosquito netting and there were socio-economic problems which are now being solved at the much better scale so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub-saharan Africa and UN says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent now this sounds a little theoretical but it's not so theoretically you know these economists they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of economy we in public health we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it's sort of the same percentage if your economy grow with 4% you ought to reduce child mortality with 4% if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want so so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years and economists would never do that I have just divided into two period in the 90s only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent whereas now second gear is like Africa had first gear now they go into second gear but even this is not a fair representation of Africa because it's an average it's an average speed of reduction in Africa and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs still here child F per 1000 on that axis here we have year and I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries I give you Congo which was high Ghana lower and Kenya even lower and what has happened over the years since there here we go you can see with independence literacy improved you know and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene was improved and things got better but then in the eighties watch out here Congo got into civil war and they leveled off fear Ghana got very help fast this was the backlash in Kenya and go on a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down together still the standstill in Congo that's why we are today you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this serie improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one place that their countries are so different and they married to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about Europe as one place I can tell you

school actually starting 1842 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later you have to realise that the investments we do in progress for long term investments is not about just five years it's long term investments and and and Sweden never reach Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1 percent when I calculate so we are off track that was Sweden is but you don't talk about it so much you know we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you Thailand see what a success story in Thailand from the 1960s how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels of Sweden and I'll give you another story Egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health he just was up here 1960 higher than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease you know and and malaria and a lot of problem and then they got the Aswan Dam they got electricity in the homes the increased education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible and the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did as it fastest you know Kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill now let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality I'm going to show you the relation between child mortality on this axis here this here is child mortality and here I have the family size the relation between child mortality and family size one two three four children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see the continent the dark blue here is sub-saharan Africa you know and the size of the bubble is the population and these are the so called developing countries they had high or very high child mortality and family size six to eight and and and the ones over there they were the so called Western countries they had low child mortality and small families what has happened what I want you now is to see with your own eyes the relation between falling child mortality and decrease in family size I just want not have any ruby has to see that for yourself this is what happened now I start the world here we come down with their educational smallpox better education you know health service it got on there China comes Indian to the Western box here you know and here Brazil is in the west of all India's approach' the first African countries coming into the Western ball and we get a lot of new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down here this is the vision we have isn't it and look now the African the first African countries here are coming in there we are today there is no such thing as a Western world and developing world this is the this is the report from UN which came out on Friday it's very good levels and Friends and child mortality except this page this page is very bad it's the categorization of countries it labels developing countries I can read from the listed developing countries Republic of Korea South Korea now they get some some how can they be developing countries they have here Singapore that the lowest child mortality in the world is Singapore they bypass Sweden and five years ago and they are label developing country they have here guitar it's a richest country in the world with aljazeera how the heck could they be developing this is crap the rest there is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fit to the data you know and we have to realize that we are all going to live into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look even if we look in Africa these are the African countries you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size even within Africa it's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health metrics and evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50% of the fallen child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we got get girls in school we will get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong that's why we must have that long-term perspective but we must measure the impact over ten years period it's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down into the corner why we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter or actor most important from humanitarian aspects it's a decent life for children we are talking about but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population let's be clear about that and the way to do that that is to get child mortality down get access to family planning and behind that a drive of female education and that is fully possible let's do it thank you very much you [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] we are here today because United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries they're called Millennium Development Goals and the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them and by specifying eight different goals the United Nations have said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get a good life for people look here you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspects from aid to trade there's a second reason I like these Development Goals and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality the aim here is to reduce child mortality with two thirds from 1990 to 2050 that's a 4% reduction per year and this with measuring that's what make the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people and what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia in Middle East in Latin America and East Europe that is reducing with this rate and even my T Brazil is going down with 5% per year and Turkey with 7% per year so there's good news but then I hear people saying there is no progress in Africa and there's not even statistics in Africa to know what is happening I'll prove them wrong on both points come with me to the wonderful world of statistic I bring you to the webpage child mortality dot or you know where you can bag deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it's done by UN specialists you know and I will take Kenya as an example here you see the data don't panic now don't panic you know I'll help you through this it looks you know nasty like in in in college when you did like statistics man but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself from where do the date that come what is the origin of the data is it so that in Kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of a child and it's sent to the Statistical Office no low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization it exists but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family and it's not registered so what we rely on is not incomplete system we have interviews we have surveys and in this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and Oscar about birth history how many children did you have order you're alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what you used to be called a demographic Health Survey report but these surveys are costly so they can only be done with three to five years interval but they have good quality so this is this is a limitation and all these colored lines here are results each color is one serving but that's too complicated for today so I'll simplified for you and I give you one average point for each survey this was 1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when the expert in the UN have got these service in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and trend line and the trend line looks like this see here is the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing and they estimated that 2008 Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I was sad because we could see this this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic but in June I got the mail in my inbox from demographic Health Survey and it showed good news from Kenya I was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey then it just took another three months for you and to get it into their server and on Friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn't it nice isn't it nice yeah I was actually on Friday sitting in front of my computer and I saw that the death rate fall from 128 to 84 yes that morning you know so we celebrated but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress I'm going into some details here because you n do it like this they start 1992 they measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no progress that's unfair as a professor I think I have the right to propose something differently I would say at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend it's to two surveys and you can see what's happening now they have 2.4 percent had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya I may have joined these two points so what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality we have a decent trend it coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs and the reason here for Africa is especially important because 90s was a bad decade not only in Kenya but across Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was resistant for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got late to the mosquito netting and there were socio-economic problems which are now being solved at the much better scale so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub-saharan Africa and UN says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent now this sounds a little theoretical but it's not so theoretically you know these economists they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of economy we in public health we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it's sort of the same percentage if your economy grow with 4% you ought to reduce child mortality with 4% if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want so so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years and economists would never do that I have just divided into two period in the 90s only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent whereas now second gear is like Africa had first gear now they go into second gear but even this is not a fair representation of Africa because it's an average it's an average speed of reduction in Africa and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs still here child F per 1000 on that axis here we have year and I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries I give you Congo which was high Ghana lower and Kenya even lower and what has happened over the years since there here we go you can see with independence literacy improved you know and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene was improved and things got better but then in the eighties watch out here Congo got into civil war and they leveled off fear Ghana got very help fast this was the backlash in Kenya and go on a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down together still the standstill in Congo that's why we are today you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this serie improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one place that their countries are so different and they married to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about Europe as one place I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different everyone knows that and they are judged each country on how they are doing you know so so let me show the why the picture my country Sweden 1800 we were up there what the strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate it's very strange it's sort of embarrassing but we had that habit in Sweden you know that we counted all the child that's even if we didn't do anything about it and then you see these are famine years this was bad years and people got fed up with freedom my ancestors moved to the United States you know and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service and child mortality came though we never had a war Sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Keister, a person's buttocks. Though the modern meaning of keister refers somewhat indecorously to a person's behind, the word's history does not begin with the rear end. Instead, it can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European kista, which described a woven container. Kista influenced the creation of words like the Greek kiste, meaning basket or box, and later, the Latin cista, which meant box or chest. In proto-Germanic, a sturdy, box-like container was described by the word kista, which eventually gave us chest in English. For every locked chest, there is both a key and a lock pick, and the history of keister draws us into this world of petty crime and speculative etymology. Keister may have come from the British dialect kist, which was the northern form of chest. In the underworld jargon of the late 1800s, it referred to a burgler's tool kit that can be locked, and by the early 20th century, it meant safe or strong box. Numerous theories about keister's connection to the buttocks abound, one being, that is courtesy of the slang sense, used by pick-pockets to describe the treasure of a rear trouser pocket. Unfortunately, what isn't safe in your kist may not be safe near your keister either.

**Transcript**:
Twenty-one grams. That is the mass of all of the electrons in
your body if, like me, you weigh about 70 kilograms. Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism,
which means that as your electrons are traveling through space time, they interact with the
Higgs field and it is that that gives them their mass. It slows them down and stops them from traveling
at the speed of light. But most of your mass doesn’t come from
the Higgs mechanism. And neither does all of this stuff that you
see around you. The mass is coming from somewhere quite different
and that is because most of your mass and most of this mass comes from neutrons and
protons and they are not fundamental particles. They are made of constituent particles called
quarks. Now the theory that describes quarks and their
interactions with each other through gluons is called quantum chromo dynamics. And chromo is the Greek word for color. So in some way these objects are meant to
carry the color charge. But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength
of visible light, so there is no way that they are actually colored, but it is a useful
analogy that helps us think about how they interact and the particles that they can make
up. Now the rules are pretty simple. In order for a particle to exist, it must
be colorless or white, like this house. Now you can accomplish that in two different
ways. You could make three quarks in where each
one is a different color, red, green and blue, so overall they combine to produce white. Or you could use a quark and an anti quark
where one is a color like green and the other is its anti color, say, magenta. Now what I would like to do on this little
patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks actually bind together and form different
particles. Now for this you need to remember that in
the last video we talked about how empty space is not truly empty. So the beach here is has these undulations
in it which represent the fluctuations in the gluon field. But you have to imagine this beach sort of
rippling and these bumps coming and going. Now that is really important, because to get
rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy. And this is an important part of binding the
quarks together. The existence of quarks actually suppresses
the gluon fluctuations and creates what is called a flux tube, an area where there is
really nothing in the vacuum and that is in between this quark and the anti quark. And that pairs them up and creates what is
called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair. What is interesting about that flux tube is
that as these quarks become more separated, the flux tube remains the same diameter and
the same sort of depth of suppression of the field, which means that the force doesn't
actually increase. It is not like a spring. It is not like an elastic band. The force is the same that is pulling these
quarks back together. But you are putting more work in as you move
these quarks and anti quarks further apart. And so for a time people thought: Well, these
quarks are always going t be confined, however far you move them. You are just going to get a really long flux
tube. But what actually happens is you that you
put in enough energy that you can actually create a quark, anti quark pair. >> Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined. You can never see an individual quark, because
if you try to pull it out, you put so much energy into the situation that another quark,
anti quark pair will be created. >> Now to form a proton, we are going to need
an up quark, another up quark and a down quark. Now the standard model of a proton that you
have probably seen involves these quarks bounded together by little gluon springs that go between
them. >> We know that that picture is totally wrong
now. Even in the best sense you might have hoped
that you would see flux tubes around the edge of the triangle. But we know that, in fact, they don’t do
that. That you get these y shaped flex tubes. >> The crazy thing about a proton is that
there may be more than three quarks there. You see, you can have additional quark, anti
quark pairs pop in and out of existence. So at any given time there could be five or
seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could make up a proton. So this is what a proton actually looks like. You can see that the quarks like to sit on
those lumps in the gluon field. And you can see the two up quarks and a down
quark, but there is also a strange quark and an anti strange quark, which is strange, because
you don’t normally think of these quarks being inside a proton, but they can be at
any particular point in time. And you can also see that these quarks have
cleared out the vacuum. And you can see that there is kind of these
flux tubes which are the areas where the gluon field has been suppressed. And that is really what is binding these quarks
together. >> That is the strong force that binds quarks
into the heart of the proton. >> It is intrinsically related to the fact
that clearing out those fluctuations has more energy than where they are. >> That is right. It costs energy to clear the vacuum. >> So where is the mass of the proton really
coming from? Well, of course, the constituent quarks do
interact with the Higgs field and that gives them a small amount of mass. But if you add up the mass of all the quarks
in the proton it would only account for about one percent of its total mass. So where is the rest of the mass coming from? The answer is: energy. You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E
equals mc squared. Well, that says we have got a lot of energy
for just a little bit of a mass. But if you rearrange the equation you can
see that we can get an amount of mass if there is lots of energy there. And that is really where most of the mass
of the proton is coming from. It is from the fact that there are these energy
fluctuations in the gluon field and the quarks are interacting with those gluons. That is where your mass is coming from. It is coming from the energy that is in there. You know, Einstein talked about, well, if
I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually have a slightly greater mass than the same
cup of tea when cold. And he was right. I mean, you can’t measure it with a cup
of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that
your mass is packed with energy, because of the interactions between the quarks and these
gluon fluctuations in that gluon field. I think it is extraordinary, because what
we think of as ordinarily empty space, you know, that turns out to be the thing that
gives us all most of our mass. I really want to thank Audible.com for supporting

**Transcript**:
Twenty-one grams. That is the mass of all of the electrons in
your body if, like me, you weigh about 70 kilograms. Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism,
which means that as your electrons are traveling through space time, they interact with the
Higgs field and it is that that gives them their mass. It slows them down and stops them from traveling
at the speed of light. But most of your mass doesn’t come from
the Higgs mechanism. And neither does all of this stuff that you
see around you. The mass is coming from somewhere quite different
and that is because most of your mass and most of this mass comes from neutrons and
protons and they are not fundamental particles. They are made of constituent particles called
quarks. Now the theory that describes quarks and their
interactions with each other through gluons is called quantum chromo dynamics. And chromo is the Greek word for color. So in some way these objects are meant to
carry the color charge. But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength
of visible light, so there is no way that they are actually colored, but it is a useful
analogy that helps us think about how they interact and the particles that they can make
up. Now the rules are pretty simple. In order for a particle to exist, it must
be colorless or white, like this house. Now you can accomplish that in two different
ways. You could make three quarks in where each
one is a different color, red, green and blue, so overall they combine to produce white. Or you could use a quark and an anti quark
where one is a color like green and the other is its anti color, say, magenta. Now what I would like to do on this little
patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks actually bind together and form different
particles. Now for this you need to remember that in
the last video we talked about how empty space is not truly empty. So the beach here is has these undulations
in it which represent the fluctuations in the gluon field. But you have to imagine this beach sort of
rippling and these bumps coming and going. Now that is really important, because to get
rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy. And this is an important part of binding the
quarks together. The existence of quarks actually suppresses
the gluon fluctuations and creates what is called a flux tube, an area where there is
really nothing in the vacuum and that is in between this quark and the anti quark. And that pairs them up and creates what is
called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair. What is interesting about that flux tube is
that as these quarks become more separated, the flux tube remains the same diameter and
the same sort of depth of suppression of the field, which means that the force doesn't
actually increase. It is not like a spring. It is not like an elastic band. The force is the same that is pulling these
quarks back together. But you are putting more work in as you move
these quarks and anti quarks further apart. And so for a time people thought: Well, these
quarks are always going t be confined, however far you move them. You are just going to get a really long flux
tube. But what actually happens is you that you
put in enough energy that you can actually create a quark, anti quark pair. >> Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined. You can never see an individual quark, because

in the proton it would only account for about one percent of its total mass. So where is the rest of the mass coming from? The answer is: energy. You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E
equals mc squared. Well, that says we have got a lot of energy
for just a little bit of a mass. But if you rearrange the equation you can
see that we can get an amount of mass if there is lots of energy there. And that is really where most of the mass
of the proton is coming from. It is from the fact that there are these energy
fluctuations in the gluon field and the quarks are interacting with those gluons. That is where your mass is coming from. It is coming from the energy that is in there. You know, Einstein talked about, well, if
I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually have a slightly greater mass than the same
cup of tea when cold. And he was right. I mean, you can’t measure it with a cup
of tea, but most of your mass you owe to E equals mc squared, you owe to the fact that
your mass is packed with energy, because of the interactions between the quarks and these
gluon fluctuations in that gluon field. I think it is extraordinary, because what
we think of as ordinarily empty space, you know, that turns out to be the thing that
gives us all most of our mass. I really want to thank Audible.com for supporting

**Transcript**:
Twenty-one grams. That is the mass of all of the electrons in
your body if, like me, you weigh about 70 kilograms. Now all of the mass comes from the Higgs mechanism,
which means that as your electrons are traveling through space time, they interact with the
Higgs field and it is that that gives them their mass. It slows them down and stops them from traveling
at the speed of light. But most of your mass doesn’t come from
the Higgs mechanism. And neither does all of this stuff that you
see around you. The mass is coming from somewhere quite different
and that is because most of your mass and most of this mass comes from neutrons and
protons and they are not fundamental particles. They are made of constituent particles called
quarks. Now the theory that describes quarks and their
interactions with each other through gluons is called quantum chromo dynamics. And chromo is the Greek word for color. So in some way these objects are meant to
carry the color charge. But they are much, much smaller than the wavelength
of visible light, so there is no way that they are actually colored, but it is a useful
analogy that helps us think about how they interact and the particles that they can make
up. Now the rules are pretty simple. In order for a particle to exist, it must
be colorless or white, like this house. Now you can accomplish that in two different
ways. You could make three quarks in where each
one is a different color, red, green and blue, so overall they combine to produce white. Or you could use a quark and an anti quark
where one is a color like green and the other is its anti color, say, magenta. Now what I would like to do on this little
patch of beach behind me is simulate how quarks actually bind together and form different
particles. Now for this you need to remember that in
the last video we talked about how empty space is not truly empty. So the beach here is has these undulations
in it which represent the fluctuations in the gluon field. But you have to imagine this beach sort of
rippling and these bumps coming and going. Now that is really important, because to get
rid of those fluctuations actually takes energy. And this is an important part of binding the
quarks together. The existence of quarks actually suppresses
the gluon fluctuations and creates what is called a flux tube, an area where there is
really nothing in the vacuum and that is in between this quark and the anti quark. And that pairs them up and creates what is
called a meson, the quark, anti quark pair. What is interesting about that flux tube is
that as these quarks become more separated, the flux tube remains the same diameter and
the same sort of depth of suppression of the field, which means that the force doesn't
actually increase. It is not like a spring. It is not like an elastic band. The force is the same that is pulling these
quarks back together. But you are putting more work in as you move
these quarks and anti quarks further apart. And so for a time people thought: Well, these
quarks are always going t be confined, however far you move them. You are just going to get a really long flux
tube. But what actually happens is you that you
put in enough energy that you can actually create a quark, anti quark pair. >> Nevertheless, the quarks are still combined. You can never see an individual quark, because
if you try to pull it out, you put so much energy into the situation that another quark,
anti quark pair will be created. >> Now to form a proton, we are going to need
an up quark, another up quark and a down quark. Now the standard model of a proton that you
have probably seen involves these quarks bounded together by little gluon springs that go between
them. >> We know that that picture is totally wrong
now. Even in the best sense you might have hoped
that you would see flux tubes around the edge of the triangle. But we know that, in fact, they don’t do
that. That you get these y shaped flex tubes. >> The crazy thing about a proton is that
there may be more than three quarks there. You see, you can have additional quark, anti
quark pairs pop in and out of existence. So at any given time there could be five or
seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could make up a proton. So this is what a proton actually looks like. You can see that the quarks like to sit on
those lumps in the gluon field. And you can see the two up quarks and a down
quark, but there is also a strange quark and an anti strange quark, which is strange, because
you don’t normally think of these quarks being inside a proton, but they can be at
any particular point in time. And you can also see that these quarks have
cleared out the vacuum. And you can see that there is kind of these
flux tubes which are the areas where the gluon field has been suppressed. And that is really what is binding these quarks
together. >> That is the strong force that binds quarks
into the heart of the proton. >> It is intrinsically related to the fact
that clearing out those fluctuations has more energy than where they are. >> That is right. It costs energy to clear the vacuum. >> So where is the mass of the proton really
coming from? Well, of course, the constituent quarks do
interact with the Higgs field and that gives them a small amount of mass. But if you add up the mass of all the quarks
in the proton it would only account for about one percent of its total mass. So where is the rest of the mass coming from? The answer is: energy. You know, Einstein’s famous equation: E

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other. You never see an Indian come and endeavor
to make the white people do so." It's Tecumseh.
Drop the mic... [dinging noise] is something that I would do except that the mic is actually attached to my shirt so there's n– there's no drama in this. Clearly a Native American criticism of white people, and I happen to know that that particular one comes from Tecumseh and I don't get shocked today. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans were continuing to push westward into territories where Indians were living. I mean, this was a big reason for the Louisiana
Purchase after all. By the beginning of the war, more than 400,000 settlers had moved into territories west of the original 13 colonies and they outnumbered American Indians by a significant margin. Some native groups responded with a measure
of assimilation. Cherokees like John Ross wanted to become
more "civilized", that is, more white and farmer-y. And some of them did even adopt such civilized practices as written languages and slavery, the most civilized practice of all. [sigh] People are always like, "Why aren't
you more celebratory of American History?" Well, why isn't there more to celebrate? But other Indians wanted to resist. The best known of these were the aforementioned
Tecumseh and his brother Tensk – Stan, can you just put it on the screen? [Tenskwatawa on screen] Yes.
Let's just enjoy looking at that. Right, that's just for all you visual learners. So he was also known as The Prophet, because of his religious teachings, and also because of the pronunciation issues. The Prophet encouraged Indians, especially those living in and around the settlement of Prophetstown, to abandon the ways of the whites, primarily in the form of alcohol and manufactured consumer goods. So stop drinking alcohol and eating refined
sugars – this guy sounds like my doctor! Tecumseh was more militant; attempting to revive Neolin's idea of pan-Indianism and actively resisting white settlement. As he put it, "Sell a country, why not sell
the air, the great sea, as well as the Earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for
the use of his children?" The Americans responded to this reasonable
criticism in the traditional manner – with guns. William Henry Harrison destroyed the native settlement at Prophetstown in what would become known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. He would later ride that fame all the way to the
presidency in 1840 and then – SPOILER ALERT: He would give the longest inauguration address
ever, catch a cold, and die 40 days later. Let that be a lesson to you, American
politicians: Long speeches? Fatal! So I just painted a pretty negative picture of the American treatment of the Indians – because it was awful. But I haven't mentioned how this relates to
the War of 1812. The Americans were receiving reports that the British were encouraging Tecumseh, which they probably were. And the important thing to remember here is that the War of 1812, like the Seven Years War and the American Revolution was also a war against Indians. And as in those other two wars, the Indians
were the biggest losers. And not in the cool way of biggest loser where, like, Trainer Bob helps you lose weight, but in the really sad way, where your entire civilization gets John C. Calhouned. So the War of 1812 was the first time that
the United States declared war on anybody. It was also the smallest margin of a declaration of war vote: 79 to 49 in the House and 19 to 13 in the Senate. Northern States, which relied on trade a lot, didn't want to go to war, while southern and western states, which were more agrarian and wanted expansion to get land for farming and slavery, did. The closeness of the vote reflects a profound
ambivalence about the war. As Henry Adams wrote, "Many Nations have gone to war in pure gaiety of the heart, but perhaps the United States were the first to force themselves into a war they dreaded, in the hope that the war itself might create the spirit they lacked." Don't worry, Henry Adams! In the future we're gonna
get pretty gaiety of heart-ish about war. Anyway, as an actual war, the War of 1812
was something of a farce. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The US army numbered 10-12 thousand and its officers were sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking. The US navy had 17 ships.
Great Britain had 1,000. Also, America had very little money, Britain
collected 40 times more tax revenue than the US. But Britain was busy fighting Napoleon, which is why they didn't really start kicking America's butt until 1814, after Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon's defeat was also the practice of impressment, since Britain didn't need so many sailors anymore. Initially, much of the war consisted of America's attempts to take Canada, which any map will show you went smashingly. Americans were confident the Canadians would rush to join the US. When marching from Detroit, General
William Hull informed the Canadians that, "You will be emancipated from tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified station of free men." And the Canadians were like, "Yeah, we're
okay actually." And so the British in Canada, with their Indian allies, went ahead and captured Detroit and then forced Hull's surrender. America's lack of success in Canada was primarily
attributable to terrible strategy. They might have succeeded if they'd taken Montreal, but they didn't want to march through northern New York because it was full of Federalists who were opposed to the war. Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that
the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name. It's hard out there for a Cockburn. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Given these problems it's amazing there were
any American successes, but there were. The battleship USS Constitution broke the myth of British naval invincibility when cannonballs bounced off it and earned it the nickname "Old Ironsides". Oliver Hazard Perry defeated a British fleet,
in, of all places, Lake Erie. At the battle of the Thames, William Harry
Harrison defeated Tecumseh. And the battle of Horseshoe Ben showed one of the reasons why Indians were defeated when Andrew Jackson played one group of Creeks against another group of Creeks and Cherokees. 800 Indians were killed in that battle. And speaking of Jackson, the most notable American victory of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which catapulted him to prominence. He lost only 71 men while inflicting 2,036
British casualties. Of course, the most memorable thing about the battle is that it took place two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed. But hey, that's not Jackson's fault. Again – no twitter, #1815problems. The treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, proved just how necessary the war had been: not at all. No territory changed hands when
negotiations started. And in August 1814, the British asked for Northern Maine, demilitarization of The Great Lakes, and some territory to create an independent nation for the Indians, and the Northwest. But none of that happened, not because the U.S.
was in a particularly good negotiating position, but it would have been awkward for Great Britain to carve out pieces of the US, and then tell Russia and Prussia that they couldn't take pieces of Europe for themselves to celebrate their victory in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no provisions in the treaty about impressment or free trade and basically the treaty returned everything to the status quo. So, neither the US or Great Britain actually
won. But the Indians suffered significant casualties
and gave up even more territory, definitely lost. So with a treaty like that, the war must have had a negligible impact on American history, right? Except, no; the war of 1812 confirmed that
the US would exist. Britain would never invade American again
(until 1961). I mean the US were good customers, and Great Britain was happy to let them trade, as long as that trade wasn't helping a French dictator. The War launched Andrew Jackson's career and solidified the settlement and conquest of land east of the Mississippi River. And our lack of success in Canada reinforced Canadian nationalism while also ensuring that instead of becoming one great nation, we would forever be Canada's pants. The war also spelled the end of the Federalist Party, which tried in 1815 with the Hartford Convention to change the constitution. In retrospect, the Hartford Convention proposals
actually look pretty reasonable. They wanted to eliminate the clause wherein
black people were counted as 3/5 of a human, and require a 2/3 congressional majority
to declare war. But Because they had their convention right before Jackson's victory at New Orleans, they only came off looking unpatriotic and out of touch, as the elite so often do. It's hard to argue that the Americans really
won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's
international interventions, you need to remember, it didn't begin in Afghanistan or even Europe;
it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other. You never see an Indian come and endeavor
to make the white people do so." It's Tecumseh.
Drop the mic... [dinging noise] is something that I would do except that the mic is actually attached to my shirt so there's n– there's no drama in this. Clearly a Native American criticism of white people, and I happen to know that that particular one comes from Tecumseh and I don't get shocked today. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans were continuing to push westward into territories where Indians were living. I mean, this was a big reason for the Louisiana
Purchase after all. By the beginning of the war, more than 400,000 settlers had moved into territories west of the original 13 colonies and they outnumbered American Indians by a significant margin. Some native groups responded with a measure
of assimilation. Cherokees like John Ross wanted to become
more "civilized", that is, more white and farmer-y. And some of them did even adopt such civilized practices as written languages and slavery, the most civilized practice of all. [sigh] People are always like, "Why aren't
you more celebratory of American History?" Well, why isn't there more to celebrate? But other Indians wanted to resist. The best known of these were the aforementioned
Tecumseh and his brother Tensk – Stan, can you just put it on the screen? [Tenskwatawa on screen] Yes.
Let's just enjoy looking at that. Right, that's just for all you visual learners. So he was also known as The Prophet, because of his religious teachings, and also because of the pronunciation issues. The Prophet encouraged Indians, especially those living in and around the settlement of Prophetstown, to abandon the ways of the whites, primarily in the form of alcohol and manufactured consumer goods. So stop drinking alcohol and eating refined
sugars – this guy sounds like my doctor! Tecumseh was more militant; attempting to revive Neolin's idea of pan-Indianism and actively resisting white settlement. As he put it, "Sell a country, why not sell
the air, the great sea, as well as the Earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for
the use of his children?" The Americans responded to this reasonable
criticism in the traditional manner – with guns. William Henry Harrison destroyed the native settlement at Prophetstown in what would become known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. He would later ride that fame all the way to the
presidency in 1840 and then – SPOILER ALERT: He would give the longest inauguration address
ever, catch a cold, and die 40 days later. Let that be a lesson to you, American
politicians: Long speeches? Fatal! So I just painted a pretty negative picture of the American treatment of the Indians – because it was awful. But I haven't mentioned how this relates to
the War of 1812. The Americans were receiving reports that the British were encouraging Tecumseh, which they probably were. And the important thing to remember here is that the War of 1812, like the Seven Years War and the American Revolution was also a war against Indians. And as in those other two wars, the Indians
were the biggest losers. And not in the cool way of biggest loser where, like, Trainer Bob helps you lose weight, but in the really sad way, where your entire civilization gets John C. Calhouned. So the War of 1812 was the first time that
the United States declared war on anybody. It was also the smallest margin of a declaration of war vote: 79 to 49 in the House and 19 to 13 in the Senate. Northern States, which relied on trade a lot, didn't want to go to war, while southern and western states, which were more agrarian and wanted expansion to get land for farming and slavery, did. The closeness of the vote reflects a profound
ambivalence about the war. As Henry Adams wrote, "Many Nations have gone to war in pure gaiety of the heart, but perhaps the United States were the first to force themselves into a war they dreaded, in the hope that the war itself might create the spirit they lacked." Don't worry, Henry Adams! In the future we're gonna
get pretty gaiety of heart-ish about war. Anyway, as an actual war, the War of 1812
was something of a farce. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The US army numbered 10-12 thousand and its officers were sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking. The US navy had 17 ships.
Great Britain had 1,000. Also, America had very little money, Britain
collected 40 times more tax revenue than the US. But Britain was busy fighting Napoleon, which is why they didn't really start kicking America's butt until 1814, after Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon's defeat was also the practice of impressment, since Britain didn't need so many sailors anymore. Initially, much of the war consisted of America's attempts to take Canada, which any map will show you went smashingly. Americans were confident the Canadians would rush to join the US. When marching from Detroit, General
William Hull informed the Canadians that, "You will be emancipated from tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified station of free men." And the Canadians were like, "Yeah, we're
okay actually." And so the British in Canada, with their Indian allies, went ahead and captured Detroit and then forced Hull's surrender. America's lack of success in Canada was primarily
attributable to terrible strategy. They might have succeeded if they'd taken Montreal, but they didn't want to march through northern New York because it was full of Federalists who were opposed to the war. Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that
the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name. It's hard out there for a Cockburn. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Given these problems it's amazing there were
any American successes, but there were. The battleship USS Constitution broke the myth of British naval invincibility when cannonballs bounced off it and earned it the nickname "Old Ironsides". Oliver Hazard Perry defeated a British fleet,
in, of all places, Lake Erie. At the battle of the Thames, William Harry
Harrison defeated Tecumseh. And the battle of Horseshoe Ben showed one of the reasons why Indians were defeated when Andrew Jackson played one group of Creeks against another group of Creeks and Cherokees. 800 Indians were killed in that battle. And speaking of Jackson, the most notable American victory of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which catapulted him to prominence. He lost only 71 men while inflicting 2,036
British casualties. Of course, the most memorable thing about the battle is that it took place two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed. But hey, that's not Jackson's fault. Again – no twitter, #1815problems. The treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, proved just how necessary the war had been: not at all. No territory changed hands when
negotiations started. And in August 1814, the British asked for Northern Maine, demilitarization of The Great Lakes, and some territory to create an independent nation for the Indians, and the Northwest. But none of that happened, not because the U.S.
was in a particularly good negotiating position, but it would have been awkward for Great Britain to carve out pieces of the US, and then tell Russia and Prussia that they couldn't take pieces of Europe for themselves to celebrate their victory in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no provisions in the treaty about impressment or free trade and basically the treaty returned everything to the status quo. So, neither the US or Great Britain actually
won. But the Indians suffered significant casualties
and gave up even more territory, definitely lost. So with a treaty like that, the war must have had a negligible impact on American history, right? Except, no; the war of 1812 confirmed that
the US would exist. Britain would never invade American again
(until 1961). I mean the US were good customers, and Great Britain was happy to let them trade, as long as that trade wasn't helping a French dictator. The War launched Andrew Jackson's career and solidified the settlement and conquest of land east of the Mississippi River. And our lack of success in Canada reinforced Canadian nationalism while also ensuring that instead of becoming one great nation, we would forever be Canada's pants. The war also spelled the end of the Federalist Party, which tried in 1815 with the Hartford Convention to change the constitution. In retrospect, the Hartford Convention proposals
actually look pretty reasonable. They wanted to eliminate the clause wherein
black people were counted as 3/5 of a human, and require a 2/3 congressional majority
to declare war. But Because they had their convention right before Jackson's victory at New Orleans, they only came off looking unpatriotic and out of touch, as the elite so often do. It's hard to argue that the Americans really
won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's
international interventions, you need to remember, it didn't begin in Afghanistan or even Europe;
it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's
international interventions, you need to remember, it didn't begin in Afghanistan or even Europe;
it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History and today we're going to talk about what America's best at: War. [Patriotic Rock Music] Uh, Mr. Green, the United States has actually only declared war 5 times in the last 230 years. Oh me from the the past, you sniveling literalist. Well today we're going to talk about America's first declared war, The War of 1812, so called because historians are terrible at naming things. I mean the could have called it The Revolutionary War: Part Deux, or The Canadian Cataclysm, or The War to Facilitate Future Wars. But no, they just named it after
the year it started. [Theme Music] I know this disappoints the military historians among you, but as usual, we're gonna spend more time talking about the causes and effects of the war than the actual, like, killing parts, because ultimately it's the ambiguity
of The War of 1812 that makes it so interesting. The reason most often given for The War of 1812 was the British impressment of American sailors, whereby American sailors would be kidnapped and basically forced into British servitude. This disrupted American shipping and also seems like a reasonably obvious violation of American sovereignty, but it's a little more complicated than that. First of all, there were many thousands of British sailors working aboard American ships so many of the sailors that the British captured were in fact British. Which gets to the large point that citizenship at the time was a pretty slippery concept especially on the high seas. Like, papers were often forged, and many sailors identified supposed American-ness through tattoos of like eagles and flags. And there were several reasons why a British sailor might like to become, or pretend to be, an American, including that the Brits at the time were fighting Napoleon in what historians, in their infinite creativity, called The Napoleonic Wars. And on that topic, Britain's impressment policy allowed them both to disrupt American shipping to France and get new British sailors to strengthen their war effort, which was annoying to the Americans on a couple
levels especially the French-loving Republicans, which is a phrase that you don't hear very
often anymore. Another reason often given for the war, was
America's crazy conspiratorial Anglophobia. There was even a widespread rumor that British agents were buying up Connecticut sheep in order to sabotage the textile industry, lest you worry that America's fascination with conspiracy theories is new. So those pushing for war were known as war hawks, and the most famous among them was Kentucky's Henry Clay. They took the impressment of sailors as an affront to American national honor, but they also complained that Britain's actions were an affront to free trade, by which they meant America's ability to trade with Europeans other than Great Britain. And to be fair, the British were trying to
regulate American trade. They even passed The Orders in Counsel which required American ships to dock in Britain and pay tax before trading with other European nations. Britain, we were an independent nation!
You can't do that kind of stuff! We have a special relationship but it's not
that special! But the problem with saying that this caused the war was that The Orders had been in effect for five years before the war started. AND they were rescinded in 1812 before the
US declared war. Although, admittedly, we didn't know about it
because it didn't reach us until after we declared. There was no Twitter. Another reason for the war was Canada. That's right Canada, American's wanted you and who can blame them we your excellent healthcare and your hockey and your first rate national anthem. Stan this is fun but enough with the #1812problems. According to the Virginia Congressman John Randolph, "Agrarian cupidity not maritime rights urges the war. We have heard but one word: Canada, Canada,
Canada." I'm not here to criticize you John Randolph
but that's actually three words. Now some historians disagree with this but the relentless pursuit of new land certainly fits in with the Jeffersonian model of an agrarian republic. And there's another factor that figured into
America's decision to go to war: expansion into territory controlled by Native
Americans. Oh, it's time for the mystery document? The rules here are simple: I try to guess the author of the mystery document. Usually I'm wrong and I get shocked. All right, let’s see what we got here. "You want, by your distinctions of Indian tribes, in allotting to each a particular tract of land, to make them to war with each other. You never see an Indian come and endeavor
to make the white people do so." It's Tecumseh.
Drop the mic... [dinging noise] is something that I would do except that the mic is actually attached to my shirt so there's n– there's no drama in this. Clearly a Native American criticism of white people, and I happen to know that that particular one comes from Tecumseh and I don't get shocked today. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans were continuing to push westward into territories where Indians were living. I mean, this was a big reason for the Louisiana
Purchase after all. By the beginning of the war, more than 400,000 settlers had moved into territories west of the original 13 colonies and they outnumbered American Indians by a significant margin. Some native groups responded with a measure
of assimilation. Cherokees like John Ross wanted to become
more "civilized", that is, more white and farmer-y. And some of them did even adopt such civilized practices as written languages and slavery, the most civilized practice of all. [sigh] People are always like, "Why aren't
you more celebratory of American History?" Well, why isn't there more to celebrate? But other Indians wanted to resist. The best known of these were the aforementioned
Tecumseh and his brother Tensk – Stan, can you just put it on the screen? [Tenskwatawa on screen] Yes.
Let's just enjoy looking at that. Right, that's just for all you visual learners. So he was also known as The Prophet, because of his religious teachings, and also because of the pronunciation issues. The Prophet encouraged Indians, especially those living in and around the settlement of Prophetstown, to abandon the ways of the whites, primarily in the form of alcohol and manufactured consumer goods. So stop drinking alcohol and eating refined
sugars – this guy sounds like my doctor! Tecumseh was more militant; attempting to revive Neolin's idea of pan-Indianism and actively resisting white settlement. As he put it, "Sell a country, why not sell
the air, the great sea, as well as the Earth? Did not the Great Spirit make them all for
the use of his children?" The Americans responded to this reasonable
criticism in the traditional manner – with guns. William Henry Harrison destroyed the native settlement at Prophetstown in what would become known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. He would later ride that fame all the way to the
presidency in 1840 and then – SPOILER ALERT: He would give the longest inauguration address
ever, catch a cold, and die 40 days later. Let that be a lesson to you, American
politicians: Long speeches? Fatal! So I just painted a pretty negative picture of the American treatment of the Indians – because it was awful. But I haven't mentioned how this relates to
the War of 1812. The Americans were receiving reports that the British were encouraging Tecumseh, which they probably were. And the important thing to remember here is that the War of 1812, like the Seven Years War and the American Revolution was also a war against Indians. And as in those other two wars, the Indians
were the biggest losers. And not in the cool way of biggest loser where, like, Trainer Bob helps you lose weight, but in the really sad way, where your entire civilization gets John C. Calhouned. So the War of 1812 was the first time that
the United States declared war on anybody. It was also the smallest margin of a declaration of war vote: 79 to 49 in the House and 19 to 13 in the Senate. Northern States, which relied on trade a lot, didn't want to go to war, while southern and western states, which were more agrarian and wanted expansion to get land for farming and slavery, did. The closeness of the vote reflects a profound
ambivalence about the war. As Henry Adams wrote, "Many Nations have gone to war in pure gaiety of the heart, but perhaps the United States were the first to force themselves into a war they dreaded, in the hope that the war itself might create the spirit they lacked." Don't worry, Henry Adams! In the future we're gonna
get pretty gaiety of heart-ish about war. Anyway, as an actual war, the War of 1812
was something of a farce. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The US army numbered 10-12 thousand and its officers were sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking. The US navy had 17 ships.
Great Britain had 1,000. Also, America had very little money, Britain
collected 40 times more tax revenue than the US. But Britain was busy fighting Napoleon, which is why they didn't really start kicking America's butt until 1814, after Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon's defeat was also the practice of impressment, since Britain didn't need so many sailors anymore. Initially, much of the war consisted of America's attempts to take Canada, which any map will show you went smashingly. Americans were confident the Canadians would rush to join the US. When marching from Detroit, General
William Hull informed the Canadians that, "You will be emancipated from tyranny and oppression and restored to the dignified station of free men." And the Canadians were like, "Yeah, we're
okay actually." And so the British in Canada, with their Indian allies, went ahead and captured Detroit and then forced Hull's surrender. America's lack of success in Canada was primarily
attributable to terrible strategy. They might have succeeded if they'd taken Montreal, but they didn't want to march through northern New York because it was full of Federalists who were opposed to the war. Instead they concentrated on the West, that is, the area around Detroit, where fighting went back and forth. The British found much more success, even seizing Washington DC and burning the white house. In the course of the battle, British admiral George Cockburn, overseeing the destruction of a newspaper printing house, told the forces that took the city, "Be sure that all the Cs are destroyed, so that
the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name. It's hard out there for a Cockburn. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Given these problems it's amazing there were
any American successes, but there were. The battleship USS Constitution broke the myth of British naval invincibility when cannonballs bounced off it and earned it the nickname "Old Ironsides". Oliver Hazard Perry defeated a British fleet,
in, of all places, Lake Erie. At the battle of the Thames, William Harry
Harrison defeated Tecumseh. And the battle of Horseshoe Ben showed one of the reasons why Indians were defeated when Andrew Jackson played one group of Creeks against another group of Creeks and Cherokees. 800 Indians were killed in that battle. And speaking of Jackson, the most notable American victory of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which catapulted him to prominence. He lost only 71 men while inflicting 2,036
British casualties. Of course, the most memorable thing about the battle is that it took place two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed. But hey, that's not Jackson's fault. Again – no twitter, #1815problems. The treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, proved just how necessary the war had been: not at all. No territory changed hands when
negotiations started. And in August 1814, the British asked for Northern Maine, demilitarization of The Great Lakes, and some territory to create an independent nation for the Indians, and the Northwest. But none of that happened, not because the U.S.
was in a particularly good negotiating position, but it would have been awkward for Great Britain to carve out pieces of the US, and then tell Russia and Prussia that they couldn't take pieces of Europe for themselves to celebrate their victory in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no provisions in the treaty about impressment or free trade and basically the treaty returned everything to the status quo. So, neither the US or Great Britain actually
won. But the Indians suffered significant casualties
and gave up even more territory, definitely lost. So with a treaty like that, the war must have had a negligible impact on American history, right? Except, no; the war of 1812 confirmed that
the US would exist. Britain would never invade American again
(until 1961). I mean the US were good customers, and Great Britain was happy to let them trade, as long as that trade wasn't helping a French dictator. The War launched Andrew Jackson's career and solidified the settlement and conquest of land east of the Mississippi River. And our lack of success in Canada reinforced Canadian nationalism while also ensuring that instead of becoming one great nation, we would forever be Canada's pants. The war also spelled the end of the Federalist Party, which tried in 1815 with the Hartford Convention to change the constitution. In retrospect, the Hartford Convention proposals
actually look pretty reasonable. They wanted to eliminate the clause wherein
black people were counted as 3/5 of a human, and require a 2/3 congressional majority
to declare war. But Because they had their convention right before Jackson's victory at New Orleans, they only came off looking unpatriotic and out of touch, as the elite so often do. It's hard to argue that the Americans really
won The War of 1812, but we felt like we won, and nothing unleashes national pride like
war winning. The nationalistic fervor that emerged in the early 19th century, was, like most things, good news for some and bad news for others. But what’s important to remember, regardless of whether you're an American, is that after 1812, the United States saw itself not just as an independent nation but as a big player on the world stage. For better and for worse, that's a gig we've
held onto. And no matter how you feel about America's

it started with freakin' Canada. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

in The MythBusters big rig spectacular Grant put his life on the line as he drove dangerously close to an 18-wheeler but what we didn't show you was that Grant wasn't the only one to tailgate a truck well before we give the truck back there's one other myth that we got off the fan site that I want to test and it's that cyclists drafting behind big rigs can get up to crazy speeds great grab your helmet let's hit the road you're obviously the one that's going to ride the bike because we all know about your fantastic fantastic bike riding skills you heard that right does the drafting effect also confer an advantage to cyclists it's a myth that has its roots in cycling's Premier event from what I understand in the tour to France you know you have your lead Rider like your your main guy uh drafts behind his teammates to conserve energy so theoretically it should work to put this Theory to the test T is first going to cycle the half mile course at 20 mph so to test whether you actually conserve energy while drafting we have a heart rate monitor and we're going to hook that up to Tori he's going to do one run without the big rig just as a control and we'll see what his heart rate is and then we'll do another test with the big rig and see if he actually uses less energy if the theory is correct he'll need less energy second time around so his heart rate will be lower here you go Power Ranger all right I'm going to go save the universe to test drafting with the bicycle tor's going to have to keep a constant speed he's going to keep track of it himself on his monitor but just to make sure I've got the liar I'm going to be checking his speed as well so bring it on this is control test no big rig 20 m per hour in 3 2 1 go like Lance Armstrong Tor puts the pedal to the pedal soon enough he's at 20 mph but it's not long before his heart is pumping like a techno trance Carrie looking like an extra from Star Trek measures his speed 22 so tari may not be king of the mountains but in a little over a minute he's home nice so I kept it at 20 miles pretty much the whole way yeah I I kept you in the range of about like 20 mph what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take a rest let my heart rate get back down to about 100 uh we're going to do it again and this time we'll do it behind the truck and we'll see if there's a difference between the heart rates while Tori puts his feet up it's a tough job someone's got to do it Grant crunches the numbers his average heart rate was 166 beats per minute so in order for us to see if he's actually working less hard when he's drafting that number of beats per minute should go down once tor's recovered everything's set for some big rig biking okay so we are going to ramp up to 20 mph and maintain that Speed 3 2 1 go like before T heaves his way up to speed 10 20 mph maintaining speed but this time there's an immediate difference he's coasting maintaining 20 mph cruising along in the wake of the big rig he even has time to talk to the cameraman this is ridiculous it's so easy big rig is approaching the finish line and after 60 seconds of freewheeling watch the verdict that was amazing I felt like I was coasting most of the time the first run I did I felt like I was pumping the entire time this time once I got up to 20 miles an hour it felt like I was just like there's no resistance whatsoever okay so the results are in for tor's bike drafting test 20 mph it turns out that you actually had a lower heart rate and were able to maintain your speed longer when you were drafting the big rig dude I totally felt the difference so it sounds like the myth is plausible it's plausible fantastic cool

**Transcript**:
Most of us think of the Sun as our friend. It helps plants grow, keeps us warm, and who doesn't love to lie on the beach on a sunny day? But for all of it's good qualities, the Sun can also be harmful in large amounts. That's why we invented sunscreen. The purpose of sunscreen is to shield the body from the Sun's ultraviolet rays, which have several harmful effects, including sunburn, aging, and skin cancer promotion. These rays are separated by their different wave lengths, into types such as UVA and UVB, which exert a variety of effects in the skin due to the absorption patterns of chromophores, the parts of the molecules responsible for their color. The primary two chromophores are hemoglobin, found in our red blood cells, and melanin, which gives our skin its pigment. We know that UVB rays cause the skin to burn. The role of UVA rays is less well understood and appears to have an effect on our tanning response, carcinogenesis, and aging. So, how does the sunscreen protect us from these rays? There are two basic types of sunscreen, physical and chemical blockers. Physical blockers, like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, reflect the Sun's rays by acting as a physical barrier. If you've seen lifeguards with noses covered in white, then you know what this looks like. The same ingredients are primary components of diaper creams, where the goal is also to create a physical barrier. Historically, they haven't always been easy to apply and were conspicuously visible on the skin, but new formulations have made this less of an issue. Chemical blockers, on the other hand, absorb the Sun's rays. They deteriorate more quickly than physical sunscreens because their ability to absorb the Sun diminishes. Generally, these are more transparent when rubbed on the skin, but some people develop allergric reactions to some of the chemicals. Regardless of the type of sunscreen, all are subjected to testing to determine their sunburn protection factor, or SPF. This is essentially a measure of the protection that the sunscreen will provide from UVB rays before one begins to burn. But even if you don't burn, you still need to use sunscreen because unless you live in a cave, you're not immune to the effects of the Sun. It is true that darker skinned people and those who tan easily have more built-in protection from sunburns, but they are still vulnerable to the effects of UVA. Children under the age of six months, on the other hand, should have almost no sun exposure as their protective mechanisms are not fully functioning, and their skin is more likely to absorb any sunscreen that is applied. Wearing sunscreen helps protect against the development of all three types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. On a daily basis, the DNA in your cells is developing mutations and errors that are generally handled by machinery within your cells, but ultraviolet rays from the Sun lead to mutations that the cell may not be able to overcome, leading to uncontrolled growth and eventual skin cancer. The scariest thing about this is that usually you can't even see it happening until its too late. But if these concrete risks to your health are not enough to convince you to use sunscreen, there are aesthetic reasons as well. Along with cigarette smoking, sun damage is the leading cause of premature aging. Photoaging from chronic sun exposure leads to a loss of elasticity in the skin, in other words, making it look saggy. Take a look at this truck driver who's left side was chronically exposed to the sun and notice the difference. This is an important point. Car windows block UVB, the burn rays, but not UVA, the aging rays. It is recommended to use sunscreen daily, but you should pay special attention before prolonged sun exposure or when at the beach or among snow since the reflectivity of water and ice amplifies the Sun's rays. For these cases, apply about an ounce fifteen to thirty minutes before you go out and once again soon after you get outside. After that, you should reapply it every two to three hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Otherwise you should wear protective clothing with ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF. Stay in shaded areas, such as under trees or an umbrella, and avoid the sun at the peak hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. And what's the best kind of sunscreen? Everyone will have their preference, but look for the following things: broad spectra, SPF of at least 30, and water-resistant. A light moisturizer with SPF 30 should be good for daily use. Take note if you decide to use a spray. They take several coats to effectively cover your skin, like painting a wall with a spray can versus a paint brush. So, enjoy the sun, but enjoy it with sunscreen.

Children under the age of six months, on the other hand, should have almost no sun exposure as their protective mechanisms are not fully functioning, and their skin is more likely to absorb any sunscreen that is applied. Wearing sunscreen helps protect against the development of all three types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. On a daily basis, the DNA in your cells is developing mutations and errors that are generally handled by machinery within your cells, but ultraviolet rays from the Sun lead to mutations that the cell may not be able to overcome, leading to uncontrolled growth and eventual skin cancer. The scariest thing about this is that usually you can't even see it happening until its too late. But if these concrete risks to your health are not enough to convince you to use sunscreen, there are aesthetic reasons as well. Along with cigarette smoking, sun damage is the leading cause of premature aging. Photoaging from chronic sun exposure leads to a loss of elasticity in the skin, in other words, making it look saggy. Take a look at this truck driver who's left side was chronically exposed to the sun and notice the difference. This is an important point. Car windows block UVB, the burn rays, but not UVA, the aging rays. It is recommended to use sunscreen daily, but you should pay special attention before prolonged sun exposure or when at the beach or among snow since the reflectivity of water and ice amplifies the Sun's rays. For these cases, apply about an ounce fifteen to thirty minutes before you go out and once again soon after you get outside. After that, you should reapply it every two to three hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Otherwise you should wear protective clothing with ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF. Stay in shaded areas, such as under trees or an umbrella, and avoid the sun at the peak hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. And what's the best kind of sunscreen? Everyone will have their preference, but look for the following things: broad spectra, SPF of at least 30, and water-resistant. A light moisturizer with SPF 30 should be good for daily use. Take note if you decide to use a spray. They take several coats to effectively cover your skin, like painting a wall with a spray can versus a paint brush. So, enjoy the sun, but enjoy it with sunscreen.

**Transcript**:
Most of us think of the Sun as our friend. It helps plants grow, keeps us warm, and who doesn't love to lie on the beach on a sunny day? But for all of it's good qualities, the Sun can also be harmful in large amounts. That's why we invented sunscreen. The purpose of sunscreen is to shield the body from the Sun's ultraviolet rays, which have several harmful effects, including sunburn, aging, and skin cancer promotion. These rays are separated by their different wave lengths, into types such as UVA and UVB, which exert a variety of effects in the skin due to the absorption patterns of chromophores, the parts of the molecules responsible for their color. The primary two chromophores are hemoglobin, found in our red blood cells, and melanin, which gives our skin its pigment. We know that UVB rays cause the skin to burn. The role of UVA rays is less well understood and appears to have an effect on our tanning response, carcinogenesis, and aging. So, how does the sunscreen protect us from these rays? There are two basic types of sunscreen, physical and chemical blockers. Physical blockers, like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, reflect the Sun's rays by acting as a physical barrier. If you've seen lifeguards with noses covered in white, then you know what this looks like. The same ingredients are primary components of diaper creams, where the goal is also to create a physical barrier. Historically, they haven't always been easy to apply and were conspicuously visible on the skin, but new formulations have made this less of an issue. Chemical blockers, on the other hand, absorb the Sun's rays. They deteriorate more quickly than physical sunscreens because their ability to absorb the Sun diminishes. Generally, these are more transparent when rubbed on the skin, but some people develop allergric reactions to some of the chemicals. Regardless of the type of sunscreen, all are subjected to testing to determine their sunburn protection factor, or SPF. This is essentially a measure of the protection that the sunscreen will provide from UVB rays before one begins to burn. But even if you don't burn, you still need to use sunscreen because unless you live in a cave, you're not immune to the effects of the Sun. It is true that darker skinned people and those who tan easily have more built-in protection from sunburns, but they are still vulnerable to the effects of UVA. Children under the age of six months, on the other hand, should have almost no sun exposure as their protective mechanisms are not fully functioning, and their skin is more likely to absorb any sunscreen that is applied.

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: X-ray, a form of electromagnetic radiation capable of penetrating solids. The word X-ray harkens back to the work of Rene Descartes, a French philosopher, mathematician, and writer in the 17th century. One of Descartes innumerable contributions to the world of numbers was the invention of a simple yet brilliant convention most people take for granted today: the representation of unknowns within an equation as X, Y, and Z. When the German scientist Wilhelm Rontgen discovered what we now call X-rays in the late 19th century, he gave them the name X-strahlen. Strahlen is German for shine, and X, of course, represented the unknown nature of the radiation Rontgen had discovered, the X-factor, so to speak. The English translation maintained the X but replaced the German shine with ray, meaning a beam of light. Coincidentally, in mathematics, the word ray refers to a line with a point of origin that has no end and extends to infinity, bringing us neatly back to the unknown. Today we understand what X-radiation is, and in spite of the humble objections of its discoverer, it is also commonly called Rontgen Radiation, eliminating with the X the fundamental mystery of its nature.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

hi everyone Cara Santa Maria here I am a huge dinosaur nerd I love visiting them in museums across the country but in lots of cases the portrayal of these giant beasts is almost as Antiquated as the bones themselves once you put up a dinosaur skeleton it's very very difficult to take it back down again there are actually some very wrong dinosaurs they're still up in a lot of Institutions if you go to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City you'll see dinosaurs that have broken tails and Broken Backs they're still dragging their tails they're still looking as they did in the early 20th century just because it's impossible to remove them from the plaster and from the armatures that they were put on that's Brian suek he's a dinosaur expert and author of my beloved brosaurus the story of a popular culture icon that's warmed the hearts of children for over a century unfortunately brosaurus isn't a real dinosaur scientists began figuring that out over a hundred years ago when Brian first met the mighty brosaurus as a young boy it had been a whopping 80 years since the scientific Community stopped calling it that 80 years but there it was in a Dusty Museum label and all as I was sort of walking by the the Brontosaurus skeleton you know myself just maybe knee high to the dinosaur itself at best I just remember looking up and imagining what it would be like to actually see the animal sort of fleshed out to hear it breathing to see it moving moving you know how this animal actually lived and then when I got home and I started you know looking into uh all the books that I had and you know talking to my teachers about dinosaurs you know I wasn't crushed by it but I found out that brontosaurus wasn't a real dinosaur you know it was this Chimera that uh had come together because of sort of fossil mistakes and you know hypotheses that later turned out to be incorrect it's a classic bone Wars era story The brosaurus is in fact an Apatosaurus but it took scientists a while to realize their mistak stakes and by then it had captured the imaginations of millions there's a species called the petaurus Ajax that the yel paleontologist OC Marsh named in 1877 and it was a relatively incomplete specimen but it was one of these long necked heavy-bodied sorod dinosaurs and the following year his field crew working at a place called KOMO Bluff in Wyoming found another skeleton of a similar dinosaur now back then you know most dinosaurs that were found were very fragmentary there might be as little as a piece of a tooth or part of a bone so if there any difference whatsoever paleontologists like Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker coope based out of Philadelphia they would name a whole new genus or species on the basis of basically the tiniest scrap if it seemed like something new so it's really no surprise that when Marsh got the skeleton of Wyoming that he decided to name it brontosaurus he gave it a different genus name so those two names stayed in the literature for a couple of decades and Along Comes paleontologist Elmer rigs in 1903 he's doing a revision of the sorod dinosaurs he has a look at both of them says you know really these are really really similar they're different species there's Apatosaurus Ajax and there's Apatosaurus excelsus but they're so closely related that there's really no reason to split them out and have a different name so he put that out in the literature on this major monograph in 1903 and nobody cared nobody paid attention to it or if they did they didn't show any sign of it museums kept putting up brontosaurus skeletons they kept naming these dinosaurs brontosaurus illustrators kept putting out brontosaurus illustrations so this was the dinosaur that the public I'd introduce to him because of its size you're dealing with an animal that's you know 60 plus feet long in many Museum exhibits it's absolutely fantastic it's not like anything anyone's ever seen before so you know brontosaurus this dinosaur that should be dead becomes the icon of the Jurassic and for many dinosaurs in general so even though it's in the literature and paleontologists actually know that the proper name is Apatosaurus to most everybody it's still brontosaurus and it's more than just the Brontosaurus to this day we see mistakes in popular culture t-rex still stands upright when we now know his posture was nearly horizontal in Jurassic Park Dilophosaurus had a giant frill and spit poison when there's no evidence of venomous dinosaurs or that dilophosaurs look like that and really in terms of bringing dinosaurs back to life there's nothing better than the movies that you know movies bring dinosaurs back to us in a way that we can really only imagine when the desire to please your fans and the desire to be as accurate to the science as possible science doesn't always want brontosaurus a moving mountain of Flesh and B one of the greatest things about science is that it's always changing based on new evidence but it's hard for us to let go of our emotional ties to what we once knew to be true I have friends who are still bummed that Pluto is no longer classified as a planet it's still there folks it's always lived in the Kyper belt it hasn't gone away just been rebranded if you will same thing with our modern view of the therapod dinosaurs we now know that lots of them were covered in feathers fuzz or fluff the director of Jurassic Park Ford in a very short and Curt tweet said no feathers jp4 now mind you this is about 20 years after paleontologists found some of the first feathery non-avian dinosaurs and we know now birds are dinosaurs many of the traits that we think of as being bird traits you know laying eggs nesting Behavior airs saxs and the skeleton most of all feathers evolved millions and millions and millions of years before amongst the non-avian dinosaurs I mean even Tyrannosaurus Rex itself you know the king of the Tyrant dinosaurs was probably INF fluff to some degree uh but chances are that we're not going to see that in Jurassic Park 4 because fans don't like it because people like me but maybe a little bit misguided people who love their dinosaurs just so very much want a naked Tyrannosaurus they can't deal with the feathers how long do you think it'll take before our romantic vision of the dinosaurs catches up with modern science I say Bring It On You may be surprised to find that when it comes to these incredible Giants of a bygone era truth is often stranger and more fantastic Than Fiction so come on Talk Nerdy To Me

hi everyone Cara Santa Maria here I am a huge dinosaur nerd I love visiting them in museums across the country but in lots of cases the portrayal of these giant beasts is almost as Antiquated as the bones themselves once you put up a dinosaur skeleton it's very very difficult to take it back down again there are actually some very wrong dinosaurs they're still up in a lot of Institutions if you go to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City you'll see dinosaurs that have broken tails and Broken Backs they're still dragging their tails they're still looking as they did in the early 20th century just because it's impossible to remove them from the plaster and from the armatures that they were put on that's Brian suek he's a dinosaur expert and author of my beloved brosaurus the story of a popular culture icon that's warmed the hearts of children for over a century unfortunately brosaurus isn't a real dinosaur scientists began figuring that out over a hundred years ago when Brian first met the mighty brosaurus as a young boy it had been a whopping 80 years since the scientific Community stopped calling it that 80 years but there it was in a Dusty Museum label and all as I was sort of walking by the the Brontosaurus skeleton you know myself just maybe knee high to the dinosaur itself at best I just remember looking up and imagining what it would be like to actually see the animal sort of fleshed out to hear it breathing to see it moving moving you know how this animal actually lived and then when I got home and I started you know looking into uh all the books that I had and you know talking to my teachers about dinosaurs you know I wasn't crushed by it but I found out that brontosaurus wasn't a real dinosaur you know it was this Chimera that uh had come together because of sort of fossil mistakes and you know hypotheses that later turned out to be incorrect it's a classic bone Wars era story The brosaurus is in fact an Apatosaurus but it took scientists a while to realize their mistak stakes and by then it had captured the imaginations of millions there's a species called the petaurus Ajax that the yel paleontologist OC Marsh named in 1877 and it was a relatively incomplete specimen but it was one of these long necked heavy-bodied sorod dinosaurs and the following year his field crew working at a place called KOMO Bluff in Wyoming found another skeleton of a similar dinosaur now back then you know most dinosaurs that were found were very fragmentary there might be as little as a piece of a tooth or part of a bone so if there any difference whatsoever paleontologists like Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker coope based out of Philadelphia they would name a whole new genus or species on the basis of basically the tiniest scrap if it seemed like something new so it's really no surprise that when Marsh got the skeleton of Wyoming that he decided to name it brontosaurus he gave it a different genus name so those two names stayed in the literature for a couple of decades and Along Comes paleontologist Elmer rigs in 1903 he's doing a revision of the sorod dinosaurs he has a look at both of them says you know really these are really really similar they're different species there's Apatosaurus Ajax and there's Apatosaurus excelsus but they're so closely related that there's really no reason to split them out and have a different name so he put that out in the literature on this major monograph in 1903 and nobody cared nobody paid attention to it or if they did they didn't show any sign of it museums kept putting up brontosaurus skeletons they kept naming these dinosaurs brontosaurus illustrators kept putting out brontosaurus illustrations so this was the dinosaur that the public I'd introduce to him because of its size you're dealing with an animal that's you know 60 plus feet long in many Museum exhibits it's absolutely fantastic it's not like anything anyone's ever seen before so you know brontosaurus this dinosaur that should be dead becomes the icon of the Jurassic and for many dinosaurs in general so even though it's in the literature and paleontologists actually know that the proper name is Apatosaurus to most everybody it's still brontosaurus and it's more than just the Brontosaurus to this day we see mistakes in popular culture t-rex still stands upright when we now know his posture was nearly horizontal in Jurassic Park Dilophosaurus had a giant frill and spit poison when there's no evidence of venomous dinosaurs or that dilophosaurs look like that and really in terms of bringing dinosaurs back to life there's nothing better than the movies that you know movies bring dinosaurs back to us in a way that we can really only imagine when the desire to please your fans and the desire to be as accurate to the science as possible science doesn't always want brontosaurus a moving mountain of Flesh and B one of the greatest things about science is that it's always changing

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Zero, a number that indicates an absence of units. In order to understand the genesis of the word zero, we must begin with the very origins of counting. The earliest known archaeological evidence of counting dates back approximately 37,000 years and is merely a series of notches in bone. It wasn't until around 2500 B.C. that the first written number system began to take form in Mesopotamia, using the units one, ten, and sixty. Fast forward another three millennia to seventh century India where mathematicians used a single dot to distinguish between numbers like 25, 205, and 250. Employed as both a placeholder and a number, this all-powerful dot eventually morphed into the symbol we know today. The word zero comes from the Arabic safira, whose literal translation is empty. Passing through Italian as zefiro, zero came into English in the seventeenth century. A second descendant of the Arabic root was adopted into English through old French as the word cipher. Originally sharing the meaning empty with zero, cipher later came to describe a code, as early codes often used complicated substitutions between letters and numbers. From this shared empty origin, zero continues to represent the number that represents nothing.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The world we live in is made of things, billions and billions of different things, like pickles and pianos
and dump trucks and octopi. And even though these things
seem totally different, they're all made of the same stuff,
just combined in different ways. To give you an idea
of how this combining works, let's take something apart. Let's start with this bowl
of macaroni salad. If you were to reverse
a recipe for macaroni salad, you'll see it's made by mixing together
a bunch of ingredients, like macaroni, mayo,
vinegar, vegetables, and mustard. This type of combining
is called a mixture. When you make a mixture, you're combining
two or more things together without actually changing
the chemical identity of those things. Like mud, for example. The soil and water in mud
haven't actually changed. They're still soil and water, you've just created
a mixture of soil and water -- mud. It turns out that macaroni salad
is actually a mixture of mixtures because many of the ingredients,
like mayo and mustard, are already mixtures themselves, which is nice for us
because if we look closely, we'll the see the three main types
of mixtures that exist. The size of the particles in a mixture
determines the type of mixture. On one end of the scale is a suspension,
like our muddy water example. You get this if you take
big chunks of something and mix it with something else
so those chunks are just floating around. Take runny mustard for example. You'll see a bunch of little particles like mustard seeds, pepper,
allspice, and minced shallots all floating around in a liquid, in this case vinegar with water. This is called a suspension because you've got particles of one thing
suspended in another. Now, on the other end
of the spectrum is a solution. The particles in this
mixture are so small, they are the actual molecules. A solution is sort of
like a suspension of molecules where one type of molecule
is blended or dissolved with another. Vinegar is an example of a solution where the molecules of acetic acid
are blended with molecules of water. The chemical properties
of the molecules haven't changed, they're just evenly mixed together now. Saltwater and carbonated soda
are both examples of solutions where other molecules
are dissolved in water. The last type of mixture
is called a colloid, which is somewhere
between a suspension and a solution. It's when you take two materials
that don't dissolve and you make the particles so small
that they can't separate. Mayo is what happens
when you take oil and water, which don't mix, and you bind them together, usually with the help
of another substance called an emulsifier. In the case of mayo,
it's lecithin, found in eggs. And now you are left
with really small globs of oil hanging out with really
small droplets of water. Whipped cream, hairspray,
Styrofoam, and Jello are all other examples of colloids. So, let's get back to macaroni salad. You've call colloids like mayo,
suspensions like mustard, and solutions like vinegar, but you've also got celery, shallots,
and all other vegetable chunks that are also part of the salad. These aren't mixtures, really,
but we can break them up, just like a TV can be broken up into smaller and smaller
complex component parts. In the case of vegetables,
if you keep breaking things up, they'll eventually end with thousands
of complex organic molecules, things like ATP synthase and RNA transcriptase and water. So now, once we've unblended
all the solutions, unmixed all the colloids,
separated all the suspensions and taken apart all of our vegetables, we've reached the end
of what we can unmix physically. What we're left with
is a whole bunch of molecules, and these molecules
remain chemically the same whether they are by themselves
or thrown together in a salad. If you want to separate
these guys even further, we need to unmix things chemically, which means we need to start
breaking some bonds.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Options: A. Two or more elements are combined with one another, B. A chemical change occurs within a mixture, C. Elements in a mixture are combined without creating a chemical reaction, D. All of the above

allspice, and minced shallots all floating around in a liquid, in this case vinegar with water. This is called a suspension because you've got particles of one thing
suspended in another. Now, on the other end
of the spectrum is a solution. The particles in this
mixture are so small, they are the actual molecules. A solution is sort of
like a suspension of molecules where one type of molecule
is blended or dissolved with another. Vinegar is an example of a solution where the molecules of acetic acid
are blended with molecules of water. The chemical properties
of the molecules haven't changed, they're just evenly mixed together now. Saltwater and carbonated soda
are both examples of solutions where other molecules
are dissolved in water. The last type of mixture
is called a colloid, which is somewhere
between a suspension and a solution. It's when you take two materials
that don't dissolve and you make the particles so small
that they can't separate. Mayo is what happens
when you take oil and water, which don't mix, and you bind them together, usually with the help
of another substance called an emulsifier. In the case of mayo,
it's lecithin, found in eggs. And now you are left
with really small globs of oil hanging out with really
small droplets of water. Whipped cream, hairspray,
Styrofoam, and Jello are all other examples of colloids. So, let's get back to macaroni salad. You've call colloids like mayo,
suspensions like mustard, and solutions like vinegar, but you've also got celery, shallots,
and all other vegetable chunks that are also part of the salad. These aren't mixtures, really,
but we can break them up, just like a TV can be broken up into smaller and smaller
complex component parts. In the case of vegetables,
if you keep breaking things up, they'll eventually end with thousands
of complex organic molecules, things like ATP synthase and RNA transcriptase and water. So now, once we've unblended
all the solutions, unmixed all the colloids,
separated all the suspensions and taken apart all of our vegetables, we've reached the end
of what we can unmix physically. What we're left with
is a whole bunch of molecules, and these molecules
remain chemically the same whether they are by themselves
or thrown together in a salad. If you want to separate
these guys even further, we need to unmix things chemically, which means we need to start
breaking some bonds.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby The world we live in is made of things, billions and billions of different things, like pickles and pianos
and dump trucks and octopi. And even though these things
seem totally different, they're all made of the same stuff,
just combined in different ways. To give you an idea
of how this combining works, let's take something apart. Let's start with this bowl
of macaroni salad. If you were to reverse
a recipe for macaroni salad, you'll see it's made by mixing together
a bunch of ingredients, like macaroni, mayo,
vinegar, vegetables, and mustard. This type of combining
is called a mixture. When you make a mixture, you're combining
two or more things together without actually changing
the chemical identity of those things. Like mud, for example. The soil and water in mud
haven't actually changed. They're still soil and water, you've just created
a mixture of soil and water -- mud. It turns out that macaroni salad
is actually a mixture of mixtures because many of the ingredients,
like mayo and mustard, are already mixtures themselves, which is nice for us
because if we look closely, we'll the see the three main types
of mixtures that exist. The size of the particles in a mixture
determines the type of mixture. On one end of the scale is a suspension,
like our muddy water example. You get this if you take
big chunks of something and mix it with something else
so those chunks are just floating around. Take runny mustard for example. You'll see a bunch of little particles like mustard seeds, pepper,
allspice, and minced shallots all floating around in a liquid, in this case vinegar with water. This is called a suspension because you've got particles of one thing
suspended in another. Now, on the other end
of the spectrum is a solution. The particles in this
mixture are so small, they are the actual molecules. A solution is sort of
like a suspension of molecules where one type of molecule
is blended or dissolved with another. Vinegar is an example of a solution where the molecules of acetic acid
are blended with molecules of water. The chemical properties
of the molecules haven't changed, they're just evenly mixed together now. Saltwater and carbonated soda
are both examples of solutions where other molecules
are dissolved in water. The last type of mixture
is called a colloid, which is somewhere
between a suspension and a solution. It's when you take two materials

that they can't separate. Mayo is what happens
