**Transcript**:
A hostile artificial intelligence called 
NIM has taken over the world’s computers. You’re the only person skilled 
enough to shut it down, and you’ll only have one chance. You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab, and now you’re floating in a raft on top 
of 25 stories of electrified water. You’ve rigged up a remote 
that can lower the water level by ejecting it from grates 
in the sides of the room. If you can lower the water level to 0, you can hit the manual override, shut NIM off, and save the day. However, the AI knows that you’re here,
and it can lower the water level, too, by sucking it through a trapdoor 
at the bottom of the lab. If NIM is the one to lower 
the water level to 0, you’ll be sucked out of the lab, resulting in a failed mission. Control over water drainage 
alternates between you and NIM, and neither can skip a turn. Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1, 3, or 4 stories at a time. Whoever gets the level
exactly to 0 on their turn will win this deadly duel. Note that neither of you can lower 
the water below 0; if the water level is at 2, then the only move is to lower 
the water level 1 story. You know that NIM has already computed 
all possible outcomes of the contest, and will play in a way that maximizes 
its chance of success. You go first. How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You can’t leave anything up to chance -
NIM will take any advantage it can get. And you’ll need to have a response 
to any possible move it makes. The trick here is to start from where 
you want to end and work backwards. You want to be the one to lower 
the water level to 0, which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4 when control switches to you. If the water level were at 2, your only option would be
to lower it 1 story, which would lead 
to NIM making the winning move. If we color code the water levels, we can see a simple principle at play: there are “losing” levels like 2, where no matter what whoever starts 
their turn there does, they’ll lose. And there are winning levels,
where whoever starts their turn there can either win or leave their opponent 
with a losing level. So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels, but so are 5 and 6, since you can send your opponent 
to 2 from there. What about 7? From 7, all possible moves would 
send your opponent to a winning level, making this another losing level. And we can continue up 
the lab in this way. If you start your turn 1, 3,
or 4 levels above a losing level, then you’re at a winning level. Otherwise, you’re destined to lose. You could continue like this 
all the way to level 25. But as a shortcut, you might notice that levels 8 through 11
are colored identically to 1 through 4. Since a level’s color is determined by
the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it, this means that level 12 
will be the same color as level 5, 13 will match 6, 14 will match 7, and so on, In particular, the losing levels 
will always be multiple of 7, and two greater than multiples of 7. Now, from your original 
starting level of 25, you have to make sure your opponent starts
on a losing level every single turn— if NIM starts on a winning level 
even once, it’s game over for you. So your only choice on turn 1 
is to lower the water level by 4 stories. No matter what the AI does, you can continue giving it losing levels until you reach 0 
and trigger the manual override. And with that, the crisis is averted. Now, back to a less stressful 
kind of surfing.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions are concerned with the situation where the water level is at 2 and it's the player's turn. The correct option in both questions is that the only possible move is to lower the water level by 1 story, which would lead to NIM making the winning move.

Although Question 3 does not explicitly state who will win, the implication is clear that NIM will win if the water level is at 2 and it's the player's turn, which aligns with the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, a more relevant question that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ would be a question that asks about the outcome of a specific water level. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent, but it asks about the possible move at water level 2, not the outcome at water level 6.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3, as it is the closest in terms of question intent, although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What strategy is used to determine the winning and losing levels in the lab?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the definition of a "winning position," it is related to the concept of winning and losing levels, which is central to the ground truth MCQ. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this question does not capture the essence of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match is not present among the generated MCQs, as none of them directly ask about the definition of a "winning position." However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the context and the strategy discussed in the transcript, I would select:

**Question 7: What condition defines a "losing" level in the lab?**

This question is related to the concept of winning and losing levels, but it asks about the definition of a "losing" level instead of a "winning" position.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but with the caveat that it does not directly ask about the definition of a "winning position."

Index: 7 (with reservations)

**Transcript**:
A hostile artificial intelligence called 
NIM has taken over the world’s computers. You’re the only person skilled 
enough to shut it down, and you’ll only have one chance. You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab, and now you’re floating in a raft on top 
of 25 stories of electrified water. You’ve rigged up a remote 
that can lower the water level by ejecting it from grates 
in the sides of the room. If you can lower the water level to 0, you can hit the manual override, shut NIM off, and save the day. However, the AI knows that you’re here,
and it can lower the water level, too, by sucking it through a trapdoor 
at the bottom of the lab. If NIM is the one to lower 
the water level to 0, you’ll be sucked out of the lab, resulting in a failed mission. Control over water drainage 
alternates between you and NIM, and neither can skip a turn. Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1, 3, or 4 stories at a time. Whoever gets the level
exactly to 0 on their turn will win this deadly duel. Note that neither of you can lower 
the water below 0; if the water level is at 2, then the only move is to lower 
the water level 1 story. You know that NIM has already computed 
all possible outcomes of the contest, and will play in a way that maximizes 
its chance of success. You go first. How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You can’t leave anything up to chance -
NIM will take any advantage it can get. And you’ll need to have a response 
to any possible move it makes. The trick here is to start from where 
you want to end and work backwards. You want to be the one to lower 
the water level to 0, which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4 when control switches to you. If the water level were at 2, your only option would be
to lower it 1 story, which would lead 
to NIM making the winning move. If we color code the water levels, we can see a simple principle at play: there are “losing” levels like 2, where no matter what whoever starts 
their turn there does, they’ll lose. And there are winning levels,
where whoever starts their turn there can either win or leave their opponent 
with a losing level. So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels, but so are 5 and 6, since you can send your opponent 
to 2 from there. What about 7? From 7, all possible moves would 
send your opponent to a winning level, making this another losing level. And we can continue up 
the lab in this way. If you start your turn 1, 3,
or 4 levels above a losing level, then you’re at a winning level. Otherwise, you’re destined to lose. You could continue like this 
all the way to level 25. But as a shortcut, you might notice that levels 8 through 11
are colored identically to 1 through 4. Since a level’s color is determined by
the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it, this means that level 12 
will be the same color as level 5, 13 will match 6, 14 will match 7, and so on, In particular, the losing levels 
will always be multiple of 7, and two greater than multiples of 7. Now, from your original 
starting level of 25, you have to make sure your opponent starts
on a losing level every single turn— if NIM starts on a winning level 
even once, it’s game over for you. So your only choice on turn 1 
is to lower the water level by 4 stories. No matter what the AI does, you can continue giving it losing levels until you reach 0 
and trigger the manual override. And with that, the crisis is averted. Now, back to a less stressful 
kind of surfing.

**Transcript**:
When Gustav Mahler was still alive in
the early 1900s, you see these caricatures of him and
it's crazy gestures his arms are up he's jumping up and down on the podium,
extremely large gestures. At the same time Richard Strauss another composer
living in the same city basically was conducting his own music like this. You know, barely moving and if you think this is a quiet part in his music you're
wrong. He thought the role of a conductor was to organize the music and keep
everything calm. Our biggest job as a conductor, it's to do justice to the
composer. My name is James Gaffigan I am a conductor. What the public needs to
understand about conducting is it's an anticipatory art, so what we do takes
place before the music happens. Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and
this hand will give a gesture before that sound. I've always found it strange to hold a baton and it's a very strange thing,
because why why is it there in the first place? But the fact of the matter is is
it is an extension of your arm. If you just make a gesture like this, you just
need to move your wrist and you don't have to be doing this all the time. Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm or keeping the beat patterns, so if you
give an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2
1 2 and you could be as small as this they'll realize that this is 2 4. From the left hand has a much more complex, strange role in our physical world and
it's freer to do things that are out of the
ordinary. It could be anything from showing where a phrase goes, it could show speed of a bow. String players are very physical in the sense
that they they react to what they see. If you have your left hand open and if you
have your right hand slightly open and you're holding this sound like as if
you'd hold a baby they'll play that way. If you conduct like this they're gonna play like this. Percussion needs clarity
from a conductor. They need to know where to hit something and the bass drum could
play only one note in an hour-long symphony, but that note is very important. The worst thing you could do to a brass
player before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they
have to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy
their confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a
delicate instrument, such a delicate moment. Leonard Bernstein was one of the
greatest musicians who who had ever lived, not just as a conductor but as a
pianist and as a composer. He was able to educate not just adults but children. Of
course when you watch him, he's always dancing and he can't he can't help
moving around the podium and his rhythm is contagious. Karajan believed in beautiful sound, upholstered sound, luxurious sound. So if
you hear some of the great recordings of Karajan, it's not always together at
these crucial moments but there's a beauty of sound always from beginning to
end. I mean he had his eyes closed half the
time and everything was he was just holding this precious thing all the time
and crouched over. Carlos Kleiber was all you know, he was holding a magic wand. He was fantasy, pure fantasy. He would make beautiful story lines to pieces
that didn't have story lines. He was all about this gesture and these beautiful
sweeping gestures. I don't believe in jumping around during a Bruckner
symphony, I think there's something sacred and it's unnecessary. I do believe
in having a great time with jazz music and music that swings. You should make
the audience want to dance although you shouldn't be a circus act. I think people
should focus on the music and not the conductor you

player before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they
have to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy
their confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a
delicate instrument, such a delicate moment. Leonard Bernstein was one of the

**Transcript**:
When Gustav Mahler was still alive in
the early 1900s, you see these caricatures of him and
it's crazy gestures his arms are up he's jumping up and down on the podium,
extremely large gestures. At the same time Richard Strauss another composer
living in the same city basically was conducting his own music like this. You know, barely moving and if you think this is a quiet part in his music you're
wrong. He thought the role of a conductor was to organize the music and keep
everything calm. Our biggest job as a conductor, it's to do justice to the
composer. My name is James Gaffigan I am a conductor. What the public needs to
understand about conducting is it's an anticipatory art, so what we do takes
place before the music happens. Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and
this hand will give a gesture before that sound. I've always found it strange to hold a baton and it's a very strange thing,
because why why is it there in the first place? But the fact of the matter is is
it is an extension of your arm. If you just make a gesture like this, you just
need to move your wrist and you don't have to be doing this all the time. Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm or keeping the beat patterns, so if you
give an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2
1 2 and you could be as small as this they'll realize that this is 2 4. From the left hand has a much more complex, strange role in our physical world and
it's freer to do things that are out of the
ordinary. It could be anything from showing where a phrase goes, it could show speed of a bow. String players are very physical in the sense
that they they react to what they see. If you have your left hand open and if you
have your right hand slightly open and you're holding this sound like as if
you'd hold a baby they'll play that way. If you conduct like this they're gonna play like this. Percussion needs clarity
from a conductor. They need to know where to hit something and the bass drum could
play only one note in an hour-long symphony, but that note is very important. The worst thing you could do to a brass
player before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they
have to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy
their confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a

[MUSIC PLAYING] MATTHEW O'DOWD: This episode is
supported by Curiosity Stream. There's been a
lot of talk lately about putting humans on Mars and
even colonizing the red planet. Is this even possible? And what would that
settlement actually look like? [MUSIC PLAYING] Mars is getting a
lot of attention. NASA's new budget mandates
a 25-year timescale for putting astronauts
in orbit around Mars. That's exciting. But Elon Musk soon
followed with a rather more audacious announcement. SpaceX plans a spacecraft
capable of transporting 100 people at a time to Mars,
not to visit, but to settle. And it may be done in
as little as 10 years. The ultimate aim is for a
completely self-sustaining extraterrestrial colony
of a million people within several decades. That's some ambition. Here's the lowdown. Musk announced this in
an hour-long presentation that was almost entirely
about the vehicle. First step-- a spaceship is
launched into orbit by a rocket booster. The booster then
returns to its launchpad and is loaded with
a giant fuel tank. It relaunches and
delivers to the orbiting spaceship enough fuel for the
four-month journey to Mars. This is only feasible
because of the reusability of the components. That means many
return trips to Mars, but it also allows
the booster to carry the spaceship and the
fuel in separate launches. As a result, the
spaceship itself can have a much bigger payload,
translating to 100 passengers, rather than, say, the
four astronauts of NASA's proposed Orion module. Now, I could go into
all of the details. But honestly, you
should just listen to or read Musk's announcement. Links below. Is the vehicle
actually possible? Sure, probably. Whether 10 years is remotely
feasible is another matter. That's the lower in the
case that, as Musk puts it, things go super well. The plausibility of this may be
governed by whether a Martian colony could really work. Musk says almost
nothing about that, so let's get into that today. The vision is for a completely
self-sufficient settlement. Anything less would
defeat the main point-- to be a safeguard
against our extinction. It needs to be able to
thrive, even if Earth is lost. it needs to mine, farm, process,
and manufacture everything it needs. It also needs to be a place
that people might actually want to live. What would that look like? The initial habitats
are going to be simple. And in fact, the
first landers probably need to bring
habitats with them. That 450-ton cargo capacity of
the spaceship will help there. These may be inflatable,
modular structures, similar to those
proposed by Mars One, or like the Bigelow
Expandable Activity Module, BEAM, that's already in use
on the International Space Station. An important advantage of
prefabricating habitats on Earth is that you can use
advanced materials with better radiation shielding. Mars's thin atmosphere
and lack of magnetic field make shielding
critical, especially for a permanent settlement. However, to protect against
high-energy cosmic rays and solar outbursts and from the
micrometeorites that also pass easily through Mars's
thin atmosphere, we really just need
a very thick roof. That means either
living underground or building dense shelters
from local material. Becoming Martian mole
people may be the way to go. For one thing, Mars
does have lava tubes that could be populated. But with the advent of
large-scale 3D printing, it's possible to
build these structures on a planet's surface. NASA's 3D-printed
Habitat Challenge produced some
incredible concepts. Some proposed harvesting
the abundant iron and silica from the Martian soil to
print a variety of structures. The winner, however
was pretty unique-- a 3D-printed dome of ice, under
which pressurized habitats could be built. That's right. We may end up living
in Martian igloos. The water we'd need for that
is abundant as ice frozen within the Martian surface. That same water is
really what makes this whole endeavor possible. We need it to
drink, to grow food. But H2O may also
be the best supply of oxygen for, well, breathing. Mars's atmosphere is 96%
CO2, and the rest equal parts nitrogen and argon. But scrubbed of CO2, that
nitrogen-argon mix makes a breathable buffer gas that
we top up with 20% oxygen. It's been tested on
mice and crickets, so I guess we're good to go. Growing plants for food requires
water and air, but also light. So we need either transparent
greenhouse enclosures or artificially-illuminated
hydroponic farms. Modern hydroponic farms are
proving vastly more productive and require far less water than
their dirt-based equivalents, so that's a promising direction,
especially because it's hard to protect
against radiation with a transparent roof. Also, those plants will
help with oxygen production. Of course, all of
this requires energy, and this may be
the simplest part. Giant solar arrays stretching
across the Martian surface are the obvious answer. The one outstanding technical
issue is the gravity. Mars's gravity is 0.38
times that of Earth. We know that astronauts
lose around 2% of bone mass per month in
zero G. It's surely less on the surface
of Mars, but we just don't know how serious this
would be after many years. To build a sustainable
multigenerational civilization, it may be necessary to
simulate Earth gravity. This is possible using a
centrifuge, a rotating ring that results in the feeling
of an outward force, a centrifugal force,
with respect to the ring. This has been proposed
for artificial gravity on long-term space
missions, but it's also possible on a planetary surface. It would still involve
a large rotating ring, but with a sloped,
slightly curved outer wall so that the centrifugal and
gravitational accelerations work together to give you
the right direction of down on that surface. To avoid annoying daily
centrifuge visits, perhaps in the long term, we'll will
build entire centrifuge cities levitating on superconducting
magnetic rails and rotating once
every few minutes. On the other hand, watching
the entire sky rotate that fast may be as bad
for the stomach as 0.38 G is for the bones. We may want to keep that
thick roof of rock or ice. Martian cities are
technically doable, and people will
certainly want to go. 200,000 signed up for
the Mars One program. Really, the feasibility
of this is more a question of economics. Once we lose the
inexorable driving force that is Elon Musk,
a Martian settlement will have to be entirely
self-sufficient or economically productive enough to
justify continued life support from Earth. Whether that could
happen quickly enough is the real question. A lot of what we learn
about living on Mars will work elsewhere in
the solar system, too. In fact, the proposed
spacecraft is meant to be a general purpose
solar system explorer. Where would you go? Mars will be fun,
but we're really holding out for those
Venusian cloud cities here at Space Time. We want to thank Curiosity

series on Mars exploration and colonization. Jake at Vsauce 3
and I have chatted a lot about what humanity's
first experiences will be like when we go to Mars. Jake's take on this question
will be coming out real soon. The link will be right
here when it does. Keep your eye out for it. Last week, we talked about the
incredible, if speculative, possibility that primordial
black holes formed in the insanely dense conditions
right after the Big Bang and that these might
still be around today. I want to address
two big questions that you had in the comments. Several of you asked how
to tell the difference between a primordial black
hole and a black hole formed when a very massive
star ends its life. Well actually, a black
hole is a black hole is a black hole,
regardless of how it formed or what it formed from. Even a black hole made entirely
from light, a kugelblitz, is the same thing
as a black hole formed from regular matter. Black holes exhibit only
three properties-- mass, electric charge, and spin. You can learn something about
the formation of a black hole from those properties. Mass is one way to identify
a primordial black hole from a stellar black hole. A star's core needs to be more
massive than around three times the mass of the sun in order
to collapse into a black hole. Otherwise, it becomes
a neutron star. However primordial black
holes don't form from stars and so aren't subject
to this restriction. They could in
principle be any mass. Also, if we find
many PBH's spread through the galaxy and
even outside the galaxy, their distribution may tell us
that it was impossible for them to have been produced by
massive stars, which are rare, as far as stars go. A few of you also asked whether
the supermassive black holes that we find at the
centers of galaxies could be primordial black holes. Well, the answer is yes. But it's really hard
to say for sure. Those supermassive black holes
started as much smaller seed black holes. Those seeds may have been
from the very first generation of supernovae, near the
beginning of the universe. However, they may also have been
from PBH's from an even earlier time. Some scientists like
that idea because we see some pretty gigantic
supermassive black holes in the early universe,
and it's quite tricky to explain how they got that
big if they grew from only stellar mass black holes. Very large primordial black
holes may help explain this, but there's no
evidence for this idea. [MUSIC PLAYING]

high-energy cosmic rays and solar outbursts and from the
micrometeorites that also pass easily through Mars's
thin atmosphere, we really just need
a very thick roof. That means either
living underground or building dense shelters
from local material. Becoming Martian mole
people may be the way to go. For one thing, Mars
does have lava tubes that could be populated. But with the advent of
large-scale 3D printing, it's possible to
build these structures on a planet's surface. NASA's 3D-printed
Habitat Challenge produced some
incredible concepts. Some proposed harvesting
the abundant iron and silica from the Martian soil to
print a variety of structures. The winner, however
was pretty unique-- a 3D-printed dome of ice, under
which pressurized habitats could be built. That's right. We may end up living
in Martian igloos. The water we'd need for that
is abundant as ice frozen within the Martian surface. That same water is
really what makes this whole endeavor possible. We need it to
drink, to grow food. But H2O may also
be the best supply of oxygen for, well, breathing. Mars's atmosphere is 96%
CO2, and the rest equal parts nitrogen and argon. But scrubbed of CO2, that
nitrogen-argon mix makes a breathable buffer gas that
we top up with 20% oxygen. It's been tested on
mice and crickets, so I guess we're good to go. Growing plants for food requires
water and air, but also light. So we need either transparent
greenhouse enclosures or artificially-illuminated
hydroponic farms. Modern hydroponic farms are
proving vastly more productive and require far less water than
their dirt-based equivalents, so that's a promising direction,
especially because it's hard to protect
against radiation with a transparent roof. Also, those plants will
help with oxygen production. Of course, all of
this requires energy, and this may be
the simplest part. Giant solar arrays stretching
across the Martian surface are the obvious answer. The one outstanding technical
issue is the gravity. Mars's gravity is 0.38
times that of Earth. We know that astronauts
lose around 2% of bone mass per month in
zero G. It's surely less on the surface
of Mars, but we just don't know how serious this
would be after many years. To build a sustainable
multigenerational civilization, it may be necessary to
simulate Earth gravity. This is possible using a
centrifuge, a rotating ring that results in the feeling
of an outward force, a centrifugal force,
with respect to the ring. This has been proposed
for artificial gravity on long-term space
missions, but it's also possible on a planetary surface. It would still involve
a large rotating ring, but with a sloped,
slightly curved outer wall so that the centrifugal and
gravitational accelerations work together to give you
the right direction of down on that surface. To avoid annoying daily
centrifuge visits, perhaps in the long term, we'll will
build entire centrifuge cities levitating on superconducting
magnetic rails and rotating once
every few minutes. On the other hand, watching
the entire sky rotate that fast may be as bad
for the stomach as 0.38 G is for the bones. We may want to keep that
thick roof of rock or ice. Martian cities are
technically doable, and people will
certainly want to go. 200,000 signed up for
the Mars One program. Really, the feasibility
of this is more a question of economics. Once we lose the
inexorable driving force that is Elon Musk,
a Martian settlement will have to be entirely
self-sufficient or economically productive enough to
justify continued life support from Earth. Whether that could
happen quickly enough is the real question. A lot of what we learn
about living on Mars will work elsewhere in
the solar system, too. In fact, the proposed
spacecraft is meant to be a general purpose
solar system explorer. Where would you go? Mars will be fun,
but we're really holding out for those
Venusian cloud cities here at Space Time. We want to thank Curiosity

and I have chatted a lot about what humanity's
first experiences will be like when we go to Mars. Jake's take on this question
will be coming out real soon. The link will be right
here when it does. Keep your eye out for it. Last week, we talked about the
incredible, if speculative, possibility that primordial
black holes formed in the insanely dense conditions
right after the Big Bang and that these might
still be around today. I want to address
two big questions that you had in the comments. Several of you asked how
to tell the difference between a primordial black
hole and a black hole formed when a very massive
star ends its life. Well actually, a black
hole is a black hole is a black hole,
regardless of how it formed or what it formed from. Even a black hole made entirely
from light, a kugelblitz, is the same thing
as a black hole formed from regular matter. Black holes exhibit only
three properties-- mass, electric charge, and spin. You can learn something about
the formation of a black hole from those properties. Mass is one way to identify
a primordial black hole from a stellar black hole. A star's core needs to be more
massive than around three times the mass of the sun in order
to collapse into a black hole. Otherwise, it becomes
a neutron star. However primordial black
holes don't form from stars and so aren't subject
to this restriction. They could in
principle be any mass. Also, if we find
many PBH's spread through the galaxy and
even outside the galaxy, their distribution may tell us
that it was impossible for them to have been produced by
massive stars, which are rare, as far as stars go. A few of you also asked whether
the supermassive black holes that we find at the
centers of galaxies could be primordial black holes. Well, the answer is yes. But it's really hard
to say for sure. Those supermassive black holes
started as much smaller seed black holes. Those seeds may have been
from the very first generation of supernovae, near the
beginning of the universe. However, they may also have been
from PBH's from an even earlier time. Some scientists like
that idea because we see some pretty gigantic
supermassive black holes in the early universe,
and it's quite tricky to explain how they got that
big if they grew from only stellar mass black holes. Very large primordial black
holes may help explain this, but there's no
evidence for this idea. [MUSIC PLAYING]

**Transcript**:
The breakfast table’s probably the last
place you'd expect to find cool physics, but there is some awesome science happening right
here, and you’ve probably seen lots of times without even realizing it. Ever notice how cereal tends to stick together
in the middle of the bowl? Or it clumps to the edges. That makes it easy to eat, but why does it
happen? We see this same clumpage with other objects
too: paper clips, thumb tacks, even bubbles in a beverage will snap together. Maybe you’ve noticed this, but scientists
didn’t fully understand what was going on until 2005, when a pair of mathematicians
decided to hit the lab, it hthe kitchen, and hit the books. What they found is cool. I’m super cereal. Check this out. Breakfast cereal is less dense than water
(and milk is mostly water). It’s buoyant, it weighs less than the milk
it displaces. That force of buoyancy pushes up on each ring,
until it matches the downward force of gravity. This interaction holds the Cheerios at the
surface of the liquid, like little toasty rafts drifting together on top of a sea of
cereal milk (mmmm cereal milk). It's a really complicated way of saying cereal
floats. But look closely at where the cereal meets
the liquid. It’s curved up. The same thing happens at the edge of the
container, thanks to the meniscus effect. Water molecules are sticky – they’re attracted
to each other, but they’re even more attracted to the edges of your bowl or glass, or to
the edge of the cereal itself. That “adhesion” forms a U-shape wherever
the liquid meets an edge. A buoyant object will always be pushed up
the liquid to the highest point on a meniscus. That’s what makes them stick to the edge,
and what causes the cheerios to become cheeri-amigos. Any two nearby Os are pushed to a high point
between them, and clumps are pushed towards the overall highest point in the bowl, around
the edge. Let’s try something denser. I don’t recommend eating paperclips, but
toss them in water and they sink. Place them carefully though, and you can get
them to float. They’re too dense to be buoyant, they float
because of surface tension. Water molecules like to stick to each other
so much, they can behave like a membrane that’s strong enough to hold up tiny things. Let’s try it with these thumbtacks. Like the paper clips, you can see they’re
pushing that membrane dow, just not hard enough to break through. If I place another one nearby, watch what
happens. They’re attracted to each other, just like
the Cheerios. But the water around each one is curving down. Instead of climbing up the water like cereal
did, they fall into each other’s sinkhole. We can mess this scenario up just by adding
soap. The chemical properties of soap lower the
surface tension of water, so anything relying on surface tension to stay afloat will sink. But buoyant objects don’t rely on surface
tension, so they continue surfing the meniscus. The first time I did this, I wondered if the
tacks were being pulled together by static attraction on the plastic coating or something. So I put in just the plastic bit to see. But instead of being pulled toward the tacks,
something strange happened… they repelled each other. The same thing happens with Cheerios and a
paper clip. That’s because light, floaty objects run
away from the low points caused by the heavy objects. A buoyant object will always repel something
held up by surface tension’s stretchy membrane. Just to be clear, you should never put thumbtacks
in your cereal. But this is what would happen if you did. All of this made me wonder: What could happen
if we could reverse the direction of water's meniscus? I coated this glass with a hydrophobic coating
that does just that. When I put thumbtacks on top of the water
in here, they floated to the edge instead of the center. And that buoyant object did the opposite,
it floated to the middle. So that’s cool and all, but does the physics
of cereal clumping actually matter in the real world? It does if you’re a tiny insect. Take water striders,. These pond skaters are nature’s Cheerios. They float so well that even a load 15 times
their body weight won’t make them sink. They can even jump on water. Tiny hairs on their legs trap air bubbles
and increase their buoyancy. They’re basically wearing swim floaties
on their feet. Other aquatic insects like water treaders
exploit surface tension, just like thumbtacks and paper clips. But they get in trouble when it’s time to
get out. Gravity is pushing them into the depressions
under their feet, but they’ve come up with a clever way to climb the meniscus. A running start doesn’t work. But by arching their bodies and lifting their
front and back ends, the bugs curve the water up, and are pulled to the edge just like the
Cheerios were. They’re carried uphill by a physics-powered
water escalator. That’s pretty cool. If you can find science like this at breakfast,
imagine what else you might see the rest of day. Try this for yourself, and see what other
floating objects you can get to attract or repel. Leave a comment and let me know what you find. And if you see any cool physics in everyday
life I should check out in a future video, let me know. Stay curious.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type 
of male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible 
for adult men. However, this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had been 
castrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes 
that would deepen their voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic 
voices were renowned throughout Europe, until the cruel procedure that created 
them was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting vocal growth can produce 
an extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices 
are already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two
major changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work,
and what causes these shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is
the result of many anatomical variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age 
and health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes. The larynx is a complex system 
of muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, 
the vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea, the tube that carries 
air through the throat. The folds are apart when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air 
against the closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating
the tissue to produce sound. Unlike the deliberate focus required 
for playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices. Rapid and small vibrations create 
high-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations 
produce deep, bellowing rumbles. Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles 
between the cartilages, we can stretch and contract those folds to intuitively play 
our internal instruments. This process is the same from 
your first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During puberty, 
the first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when 
your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and
opening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower, 
larger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic
in many males, whose high testosterone levels
lead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal protrusions 
called Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the homogenous tissue
covering the folds specializes into three distinct 
functional layers: a central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped 
in stretchy elastin fibers, and an outer layer of mucus membrane. These layers add nuance 
and depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain
more or less the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we experience the
symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers 
atrophy and decay. This decreased flexibility increases 
the pitch of older voices. But for people who have experienced 
the hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered
and outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their
vibrations, resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer healthy 
laryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control 
and causes breathy or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes 
are just a few of the factors that can affect your voice. But when kept in good condition, your voice box 
is a finely tuned instrument, capable of operatic arias, moody monologues, and stirring speeches.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, the options and the question content do not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match can be found in the generated MCQs that involve changes in the voice due to aging or menopause. Among the options, Question 3 and Question 10 discuss changes in the voice due to aging, but they do not specifically address the impact of menopause.

However, considering the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is about the physical change that impacts the drop in pitch in female voices after menopause, the closest match can be found in Question 3 and the correct option of Question 10, but with respect to menopause, the closest match is actually Question 3's option D.

But if we were to choose the closest match from the given options, it would be Question 3, but since it's not a perfect match, let's look at the options again.

Upon reviewing the generated MCQs again, Question 3 is still the closest match.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type 
of male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible 
for adult men. However, this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had been 
castrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes 
that would deepen their voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic 
voices were renowned throughout Europe, until the cruel procedure that created 
them was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting vocal growth can produce 
an extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices 
are already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two
major changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work,
and what causes these shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is
the result of many anatomical variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age 
and health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes. The larynx is a complex system 
of muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, 
the vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea, the tube that carries 
air through the throat. The folds are apart when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air 
against the closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating
the tissue to produce sound. Unlike the deliberate focus required 
for playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices. Rapid and small vibrations create 
high-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations 
produce deep, bellowing rumbles. Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles 
between the cartilages, we can stretch and contract those folds to intuitively play 
our internal instruments. This process is the same from 
your first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During puberty, 
the first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when 
your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and
opening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower, 
larger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic
in many males, whose high testosterone levels
lead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal protrusions 
called Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the homogenous tissue
covering the folds specializes into three distinct 
functional layers: a central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped 
in stretchy elastin fibers, and an outer layer of mucus membrane. These layers add nuance 
and depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain
more or less the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we experience the
symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers 
atrophy and decay. This decreased flexibility increases 
the pitch of older voices. But for people who have experienced 
the hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered
and outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their
vibrations, resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer healthy 
laryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control 
and causes breathy or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes 
are just a few of the factors that can affect your voice. But when kept in good condition, your voice box 
is a finely tuned instrument, capable of operatic arias, moody monologues, and stirring speeches.

**Transcript**:
When Homer’s Iliad was first written 
down in the 8th century BCE, the story of the Trojan war 
was already an old one. From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales 
of the long siege, the epic duels outside the city walls, and the cunning trick 
that finally won the war. In the end, the magnificent
city was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? By the time the field of archaeology 
began to take shape in the 19th century, many were skeptical,
considering the epic to be pure fiction, a founding myth imagining 
a bygone heroic era. But some scholars believed that behind the superhuman feats 
and divine miracles there must have been a grain 
of historical truth - a war that was really fought, and a place where it happened. Frank Calvert was one such believer. He had spent his youth traveling 
and learning about ancient civilizations before accompanying his brother Frederick on a diplomatic mission to the northwest
Anatolian region of Çanakkale. It was here that Homer described 
the Greek encampment at the mouth of the Scamander river. And it was here that fate brought Frank 
into contact with a journalist and geologist 
named Charles Maclaren. Locals and travelers had long speculated that Troy might’ve stood on one 
of the surrounding hilltops. But Maclaren had been one of the first to publish a detailed topographical 
study of the area. He believed he had found the site – a 32-meter mound known 
by the name Hisarlık, derived from the Turkish word 
for “fortress.” Soon after meeting with him in 1847, the Calverts bought 
2,000 acres of farmland that included part of the hill. Before they could explore any further, the Crimean War broke out and forestalled their archaeological 
ambitions for several years. After the war’s end, Frank Calvert began to survey the site, but lacked the funds 
for a full excavation. This was where the wealthy 
German businessman and amateur archaeologist 
Heinrich Schliemann came in. At Calvert’s invitation, Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, 
and decided to excavate. Eager to find the ancient city, Schliemann tore massive trenches 
all the way to the base of the hill. There, he uncovered a hoard 
of precious artifacts, jewelry, and metalwork, including two diadems 
and a copper shield. Schliemann took full credit 
for the discovery, announcing that he had found Troy and the treasure of its king Priam. But the real treasure was elsewhere. When later archaeologists 
studied the site, they realized that the mound consisted 
of no less than nine cities, each built atop the ruins of the last. The layer Schliemann had uncovered 
dated back to the Mycenaean Age, more than 1,000 years too early 
for Homer. But inside the mound was indeed evidence for a city that had thrived 
during the Bronze Age, with charred stone, broken arrowheads, and damaged human skeletons 
suggesting a violent end. It was Troy VII, 
contained in the middle layers and now ravaged for a second time 
by Schliemann’s careless excavation. The settlement, 
spanning some 200,000 square meters and home to as many as 10,000 people, thrived until around 1180 BCE. Its position at the southern entrance 
of the Dardanelles strait would’ve made a formidable strategic 
location for both defense and trade. Most importantly, there are the remains 
of a massive fortification wall – perhaps the very same one from which Priam and Hector 
once watched the Greeks approach. Of course, it’s difficult to be certain that these ruins are the true remains 
of ancient Troy, and scholars still dispute whether the Trojan War 
as described by Homer ever happened. Yet the evidence is strong enough that UNESCO has labelled Hisarlık
the archeological site of Troy. Regardless of its identity, thanks to persistence, a bit of faith, and a lot of research, archaeologists are bringing 
the long-buried secrets of an ancient, lost city to light.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 3 is not the most similar, but Question 5 mentions Schliemann, however it is not about who excavated.**

**Question 4 mentions Calvert but is not about who excavated**

The correct one is not present, however, the closest in terms of mentioning the person who excavated is:

**Question 5**

However, since it doesn't match exactly the ground truth MCQ, if we had to choose the closest one based on mentioning the person who excavated and being related to excavation it would be Question 5, but if we are strict about matching it exactly then the answer would be that there isn't a matching question.

If I had to choose I would say Question 5 is the closest but I also have to say that there isn't an exact match present in the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
When Homer’s Iliad was first written 
down in the 8th century BCE, the story of the Trojan war 
was already an old one. From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales 
of the long siege, the epic duels outside the city walls, and the cunning trick 
that finally won the war. In the end, the magnificent
city was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? By the time the field of archaeology 
began to take shape in the 19th century, many were skeptical,
considering the epic to be pure fiction, a founding myth imagining 
a bygone heroic era. But some scholars believed that behind the superhuman feats 
and divine miracles there must have been a grain 
of historical truth - a war that was really fought, and a place where it happened. Frank Calvert was one such believer. He had spent his youth traveling 
and learning about ancient civilizations before accompanying his brother Frederick on a diplomatic mission to the northwest
Anatolian region of Çanakkale. It was here that Homer described 
the Greek encampment at the mouth of the Scamander river. And it was here that fate brought Frank 
into contact with a journalist and geologist 
named Charles Maclaren. Locals and travelers had long speculated that Troy might’ve stood on one 
of the surrounding hilltops. But Maclaren had been one of the first to publish a detailed topographical 
study of the area. He believed he had found the site – a 32-meter mound known 
by the name Hisarlık, derived from the Turkish word 
for “fortress.” Soon after meeting with him in 1847, the Calverts bought 
2,000 acres of farmland that included part of the hill. Before they could explore any further, the Crimean War broke out and forestalled their archaeological 
ambitions for several years. After the war’s end, Frank Calvert began to survey the site, but lacked the funds 
for a full excavation. This was where the wealthy 
German businessman and amateur archaeologist 
Heinrich Schliemann came in. At Calvert’s invitation, Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, 
and decided to excavate. Eager to find the ancient city, Schliemann tore massive trenches 
all the way to the base of the hill. There, he uncovered a hoard 
of precious artifacts, jewelry, and metalwork, including two diadems 
and a copper shield. Schliemann took full credit 
for the discovery, announcing that he had found Troy and the treasure of its king Priam. But the real treasure was elsewhere. When later archaeologists 
studied the site, they realized that the mound consisted 
of no less than nine cities, each built atop the ruins of the last. The layer Schliemann had uncovered 
dated back to the Mycenaean Age, more than 1,000 years too early 
for Homer. But inside the mound was indeed evidence for a city that had thrived 
during the Bronze Age, with charred stone, broken arrowheads, and damaged human skeletons 
suggesting a violent end. It was Troy VII, 
contained in the middle layers and now ravaged for a second time 
by Schliemann’s careless excavation. The settlement, 
spanning some 200,000 square meters and home to as many as 10,000 people, thrived until around 1180 BCE. Its position at the southern entrance 
of the Dardanelles strait would’ve made a formidable strategic 
location for both defense and trade. Most importantly, there are the remains 
of a massive fortification wall – perhaps the very same one from which Priam and Hector 
once watched the Greeks approach. Of course, it’s difficult to be certain that these ruins are the true remains

**Transcript**:
This is me. I'm about to go scuba diving for the first time ever. I went in expecting muffled peace and quiet. I mean, one of the earliest documentaries
on underwater life was literally called “The Silent World”. “They roamed deep under the Mediterranean,
the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, in a mysterious realm, a silent world.” But as soon as I got down a few yards, I couldn't
help but notice sound all around me. It was hard to tell what direction it was
coming from, or how far away it was. It was coming from boats above me. As far as I can tell, the Earth’s water
is not as quiet as I thought. I’ve been binging this podcast all about
sound, and they've been looking into this too "From DeFacto Sound, you’re listening to Twenty Thousand Hertz: The stories behind the
world’s most recognizable and interesting sounds. I’m Dallas Taylor." So Dallas — life underwater can be pretty
loud, right? It can! Just listen to these toadfish— they oscillate
their swim bladders to make sounds that are loud enough to keep houseboat residents in
Sausalito, California up at night. Or these Barred Grunt fish, that make a grinding
sound with the teeth in their gullet. Or these snapping shrimp — they produce a sound by creating tiny popping bubbles with their claws. It’s been measured at 200 decibels. That’s louder than a gunshot. Light doesn’t penetrate very deep in water,
so a lot of ocean life has evolved to use sound as its primary sense. Because water particles are more densely packed
together than air, sound travels farther and faster in water. That makes it an efficient medium of communication
at any depth or time of day. “Let's say we had 440, like the middle
key of your piano, or whatever.” That’s John Hildebrand, he’s a professor
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He's an expert in the field of underwater
sound and how it’s used by and how it affects marine mammals. “If you looked at the wavelength of that
sound in air, that note, the 440 note, would be a little bit less than a meter long. In water, it's more like several meters
long.” What that means is that noise travels about
four times faster and farther in water than it does in air. In an experiment in 1991, sound emitted from
Heard Island was picked up at 16 sites in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It turns out that one of the most common noises
in the entire ocean that can be picked up almost anywhere these days, sounds like this: It's the sound of boats. Noise from ship traffic has doubled every
decade since the 1960s. “Basically, anywhere you go, the ambient
noise in the ocean is dominated by anthropogenic sound.” “Let's say I made a measurement 30 years
ago and now if I went to the same place and made the same measurement, it would be 10
dBs or more higher sound level than what I measured when I started my career. That’s spooky.” That’s a huge problem for animals that use
sound as their primary sense. Just listen to this audio of how noise from
a passing boat totally drowns out dolphin communication. But arguably the worst culprit of underwater
sound pollution is a process that sounds like this: This is seismic surveying. It’s a process that allows companies to
locate spots on the ocean floor where they can drill for fossil fuels. Boats with about 30-40 airguns that all go
off at once will move back and forth over large parts of the ocean. Bubbles from the horns expand and contract
typically every 10 seconds, creating a huge amount of acoustic energy that maps geological
structures deep in the ocean floor. And it’s about as loud as a jet at takeoff. This can go on for weeks at a time. A study of seismic survey noise between 1999
and 2009 found that airgun sounds were recorded almost 2500 miles away from the survey ship
itself. At some locations, they were recorded on 80
percent of days for over a year. And that changes how animals behave. A study by the Institute of Marine Science
at the University of North Carolina found that reef fish abundance decreased by 78 percent
during seismic surveying. This is what the reef looked like before seismic
surveying in the area. And this is what it looked like after. “Seismic surveying is a constroversial topic at the
coast and new research is only adding to the conversation. “One of those impacted is local fisherman
Jack Cox. He’s seen firsthand the impact seismic
surveying has on fish.” “It does something, that — we just don’t catch fish. For animals like whales — who rely on complex
sound communication systems to socialize, find food, and mate — that poses a huge
problem. If you watch this heat map from a study of
endangered North Atlantic right whales, you can see that shipping paths near Boston squeeze
the whales into a tiny space where communication is possible — it's about a third of what
it was without the ships. Susan Parks, a biology professor at Syracuse,
recorded right whale sounds throughout the early 2000s. And when she compared her audio to some that had
been recorded in 1956, she noticed that the older sounds were much deeper than her high-pitched
recordings. It turns out that the whales had started calling
at higher and higher frequencies in order to hear each other over the hum of ship noise. Apart from habitat displacement and communication
changes, there’s also evidence that boat noise simply stresses these whales out. After the September 11th attacks, researchers
in Canada’s Bay of Fundy compared underwater noise levels during a period of reduced ship
traffic to the stress-related hormone levels in the right whale population. They discovered a 6 decibel noise decrease
in the bay after 9/11, which correlated to lower baseline levels of stress related hormones. Effects like this go all the way down the
food chain. A 2017 study found that there were two to
three times more dead zooplankton after after a day of blasts from a single airgun. And the larvae of krill, which whales rely
on for food, were totally destroyed. In April 2017, Donald Trump signed an executive
order to open offshore drilling in the Atlantic. It directed the Interior Department to consider
allowing seismic exploration by 5 companies that had been blocked under the Obama administration. It’s getting widespread pushback in Congress
— there’s a bipartisan House bill and Democrat-led Senate bill to ban seismic testing
— but if those authorizations go through, companies could be conducting seismic testing
in the Atlantic by Fall 2017. So… is there any good news? Yes, there is. In 2014, the International Maritime Organization
adopted guidelines for reducing commercial ship noise levels with things like noise-muffling
propellers and insulated engines — though they’re not mandatory yet. A year later, the US Navy agreed to limit
sonar testing — which has been linked to whales stranding themselves on beaches in
habitats near Southern California and Hawaii — following a lawsuit from environmental
groups. And in June 2016, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration laid out an Ocean Noise Strategy Roadmap. It’s the start of a 10-year plan to assess
the human impact on underwater sound and the measures required to reduce it. Seismic surveys can work better, too. Norway has started multi-client surveys, so
that seismic data from a particular area is only collected once. US authorities are considering a similar process. The ocean is huge. We’ve explored less than 5 percent of it
so far. So it’s easy to forget that what we do on
the surface affects everything down below. But like plastic, chemicals, and waste, noise
pollutes our oceans. Understanding that is key to doing our part
to protect it. Thank you so much for watching, we loved doing

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] You've fired up the grill, set up the badminton
net, are those dark clouds on the horizon? Don't check your phone, your nose knows! [MUSIC] Our noses can detect up to a trillion different
scents, and many of them are deeply tied to our memories and our emotions. Like your grandma’s
house, your first dog, or . . . the smell of rain. Storm winds carry an orchestra of separate
smells, but the earthy odor that precedes a storm can be traced to three chemical sources. Before a thunderstorm, you’re probably smelling
ozone, which interestingly gets its name from the Greek word meaning “to smell”. The
electrical charge of lightning high up in approaching storm clouds splits oxygen gas
into separate atoms, some of those can reform into ozone. It’s swept ahead of the advancing
storm by windy downdrafts, and down to your nose level. As rain begins to fall, a new smell springs
from the soil: the pleasantly pungent perfume we call “petrichor”. Petrichor gets half
its name from the ethereal essence that flowed through the veins of Greek gods and half from
the stones of the Earth, which pretty much captures both its science, and the powerful
feels I get when I smell it. When decomposed organic material is blown
airborne from dry soil, it lands on dirt or rocks, where it’s joined by minerals and
the whole mixture is cooked into a magical medley of molecules. Falling raindrops then
send those chemicals airborne right into your nostalgic nostrils. When there’s no rain around, those same
chemicals remain in the soil, where they signal plants to halt their roots from growing or
prevent seeds from sprouting when there’s no water to drink. Petrichor: it’s for the
plant that’s tired of waiting . . . to germinate. Bacteria in the soil also contribute to petrichor
by releasing a chemical called geosmin, that's the same compound that gives beets their earthy
flavor. There’s other purposes for petrichor besides
showering us with emotion. It thought to attract camels to desert oases, who slurp up and transport
the soil bacteria across the sands. Petrichor that’s washed into rivers and lakes also
seems to signal fish that it’s time to spawn. There’s nothing like a rainstorm to spark
a little romance, I guess. So next time you smell a summer storm a-coming,
take a minute to think about what that rock over there is trying to tell you. Stay curious. And smell ya later. Why are sharks so scary? Bloodthirsty beasts
just waiting out there in the waves to feast on human flesh. if only we could get rid of
these guys our vacations would be so much safer, nothing to worry about while we're
surfing and frolicking out there in the ocean. Except that's not the case. Crimson Eleven Delight Petrichor

**Transcript**:
His reign marked the beginning 
of one of history’s greatest empires and the end of one of its first republics. Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed 
his civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Find out in History versus Augustus. Order, order. The defendant today is Gaius Octavius? Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus... Do we have the wrong guy? No, your Honor. Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, 
was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar. He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s 
adoptive son and heir. And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted 
him additional honors. You mean when he established 
sole authority and became emperor of Rome. Is that bad? Didn’t every place have some king 
or emperor back then? Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown 
their kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people,
not the privilege of a ruling family. And it was Octavius 
who destroyed this tradition. Octavius was a model public servant. At 16, he was elected 
to the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship. He fought for Rome in Hispania 
alongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility 
of avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate
betrayed and murdered him. Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant 
who tried to make himself a king while consorting with 
his Egyptian queen Cleopatra. After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war 
that tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back 
to increase his own power. Antony was a fool. He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms 
for himself and Cleopatra. Isn’t that what Caesar 
had been accused of? Well... So Octavius destroyed Antony 
for trying to become a king and then became one himself? That’s right. You can see the megalomania even in 
his adopted title – "The Illustrious One." That was a religious honorific. And Augustus didn’t seek power 
for his own sake. As winner of the civil war 
and commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore 
law and order to Rome so that other factions 
didn’t continue fighting. He didn’t restore the law -
he made it subordinate to him! Not true. Augustus worked to restore 
the Senate’s prestige, improved food security 
for the lower classes, and relinquished control of 
the army when he resigned his consul post. Mere optics. He used his military influence 
and personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate 
military triumphs. He kept control of provinces 
with the most legions. And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position 
twice more to promote his grandchildren. He was clearly trying 
to establish a dynasty. But what did he do with all that power? Glad you asked, your Honor. Augustus’s accomplishments 
were almost too many to name. He established consistent 
taxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation 
by local tax officials. He personally financed a network of roads
and employed couriers so news and troops could travel
easily throughout the realm. And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous 
public buildings were constructed. The writers of the time were nearly 
unanimous in praising his rule. Did the writers have any other choice? Augustus exiled plenty of people 
on vague charges, including Ovid, 
one of Rome’s greatest poets. And you forgot to mention the intrusive 
laws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage 
between social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried. He was trying to improve the citizenry
and instill discipline. And he succeeded. His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded 
Rome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered 
as a model of civic virtue. His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless 
conquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy. Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform
commits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf 
of "the people," we have Augustus Caesar to thank. So you’re saying Augustus 
was a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing? We’re used to celebrating 
historical leaders for their achievements and victories. But to ask whether an individual should 
have such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial.

**Transcript**:
His reign marked the beginning 
of one of history’s greatest empires and the end of one of its first republics. Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed 
his civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Find out in History versus Augustus. Order, order. The defendant today is Gaius Octavius? Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus... Do we have the wrong guy? No, your Honor. Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, 
was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar. He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s 
adoptive son and heir. And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted 
him additional honors. You mean when he established 
sole authority and became emperor of Rome. Is that bad? Didn’t every place have some king 
or emperor back then? Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown 
their kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people,
not the privilege of a ruling family. And it was Octavius 
who destroyed this tradition. Octavius was a model public servant. At 16, he was elected 
to the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship. He fought for Rome in Hispania 
alongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility 
of avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate
betrayed and murdered him. Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant 
who tried to make himself a king while consorting with 
his Egyptian queen Cleopatra. After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war 
that tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back 
to increase his own power. Antony was a fool. He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms 
for himself and Cleopatra. Isn’t that what Caesar 
had been accused of? Well... So Octavius destroyed Antony 
for trying to become a king and then became one himself? That’s right. You can see the megalomania even in 
his adopted title – "The Illustrious One." That was a religious honorific. And Augustus didn’t seek power 
for his own sake. As winner of the civil war 
and commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore 
law and order to Rome so that other factions 
didn’t continue fighting. He didn’t restore the law -
he made it subordinate to him! Not true. Augustus worked to restore 
the Senate’s prestige, improved food security 
for the lower classes, and relinquished control of 
the army when he resigned his consul post. Mere optics. He used his military influence 
and personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate 
military triumphs. He kept control of provinces 
with the most legions. And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position 
twice more to promote his grandchildren. He was clearly trying 
to establish a dynasty. But what did he do with all that power? Glad you asked, your Honor. Augustus’s accomplishments 
were almost too many to name. He established consistent 
taxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation 
by local tax officials. He personally financed a network of roads
and employed couriers so news and troops could travel
easily throughout the realm. And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous 
public buildings were constructed. The writers of the time were nearly 
unanimous in praising his rule. Did the writers have any other choice? Augustus exiled plenty of people 
on vague charges, including Ovid, 
one of Rome’s greatest poets. And you forgot to mention the intrusive 
laws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage 
between social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried. He was trying to improve the citizenry
and instill discipline. And he succeeded. His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded 
Rome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered 
as a model of civic virtue. His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless 
conquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy. Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform
commits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf 
of "the people," we have Augustus Caesar to thank. So you’re saying Augustus 
was a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing? We’re used to celebrating 
historical leaders for their achievements and victories. But to ask whether an individual should 
have such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of Augustus' rule and its impact on Roman society.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which discusses how Augustus maintained control over the Roman Empire. However, this question does not specifically mention the exile of a famous Roman poet.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about Augustus' treatment of artists, writers, or opponents, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to select one based on the topic of Augustus' rule, I would suggest Question 7, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
There’s a pretty awesome scene in The Fate
of the Furious where Jason Statham fights a bunch of armed
mercenaries on an airplane while holding an adorable baby in a carrier. I've always wondered how babies end up in
situations like this. What kind of hoops do you have to jump through
to cast babies in Hollywood? You were gonna shoot a baby? You sick bastard. Besides babysitting, delivering newspapers,
and, uh, wreath making, show business is the only industry that can
legally employ children under the age of 14 In fact, they’ve been in movies almost since
the birth of cinema. I hate myself so much. Casting a baby isn’t as simple as casting
a grown up actor though, For one: they don’t have to get their shift
at Starbucks covered to go to an audition, but mostly because there are some special
rules producers have to follow when casting an infant. For example, in California, babies can only
be on set for two consecutive hours per day, with actual work not exceeding 20 minutes
“under any circumstances.” The state’s child labor laws also require
that babies be at least 15 days old to be eligible for
a work permit. Which is good news for babies who can
just chill during their literal first days on earth, but not so good for productions that have
scenes with newborns because the thing is, if you’ve ever seen
a baby that’s two weeks old, you know that they don’t exactly look like
a newborn anymore. In order to get past this hurdle, productions
often try to cast preemies, who look newborn even when they’re the required
minimum of 15 days old, and in a lot of places outside of California
that’s perfectly legal. In 16 states there are actually zero regulations
regarding minimum age for baby employment in films and many other states have laws that are pretty
lax. In New Jersey for example a month-old baby
can work five hours a day, five days a week and in Louisiana they can be employed six
hours a day, six days a week. That’s more hours than I worked when I
bagged groceries after I graduated college and no I DO NOT want to talk about it. Most states also do nothing to protect the
money that babies make. Only a few places follow the Coogan Law, which requires that child actors be set up
with a blocked trust account to protect their earnings. The law is named after Jackie Coogan, an early 20th century child actor who was
in a number of Charlie Chaplin films including the American classic The Kid. As a child actor he reportedly earned as much
as $4 million, but his parents squandered all his money
by the time he became an adult. Because of his s***ty parents, moms and dads
in these states are required to set aside 15 persent of their
minor’s income in a Coogan account, which the child can access at the age of 18. Shooting with babies can be complicated,
but the film industry has a way of working around it. I would say 90 to 95 percent of jobs for babies
and toddlers are exclusive to twins and triplets because two babies can play one character. So there's two advantages there. Number one you can have them both come to
set at the same time. So if Twin A gets fussy they can call in Twin
B and they can use the babies back and forth. And the other thing is sometimes production
will split their call times so they'll have one baby come in let's say
at 9:00 in the morning have another baby come in at 2:00 in the afternoon. And so it extends their day. Also half of all twins and almost all triplets
are born premature, so productions get more working hours and
they look newborn. Sean Penn had a different solution. He directed a movie that nobody saw called
The Last Face where they put out a casting call for a one
day old baby. Since they were shooting in South Africa,
where you can cast minors with the permission of the Department of Labour, it was totally legal. Babies in show biz probably rake in big bucks
right? Unfortunately… not. Babies obviously can’t talk, so they are usually classified as an “under
5”, a term that refers to an actor with less than
five lines. It's interesting because you can have a baby
who is a recurring character on a TV show and has a name that the public can relate
to. But a lot of those babies are only getting
paid between 200 and 300 dollars a day. So babies don’t really make a ton of money. And casting them sounds like kind of a nightmare
-- are there any other options? Cut to American Sniper: Not all of them are as fake as this one, but plenty of productions resort to using
fake babies, at least for part of the shoot. Hey! Tend to my daughter please, right now! It is quite common that you know they’ll
use fake babies for the far away scenes and then you know they'll
hire a baby when they need a close up shot or a
face shot. And there are robot babies out there that
look pretty convincing. And by convincing I mean terrifying. I never thought I’d use a Mandy Moore clip
in one of my videos but here we go: They have this one robotic baby. It’s weird guys. I have two very emotional scenes where I’m
talking to a newborn in the hospital and I go to put my hand on the robotic baby and it’s like vibrating and like making
these weird movements. Babies on screen aren’t going away anytime
soon. So until producers find a cheap and easy CGI
fix for the baby dilemma, it looks like they’ll continue to have to
work within the regulations that are set up. Or they'll use demonic robot infants who will
take over humanity.

[UPBEAT MUSIC]  I know. I am doing a life hacks video. I know they're ridiculous,
but I swear to you, I've been using these
tricks in my life. And I really actually want
to share them with you. And I swear I will
not teach you things like you can cook a hot
dog by hooking it up to either side of
a 9 volt battery. I just used this trick
at a farmer's market. There was a company
selling sunglasses claiming that they were
certified polarized. To check whether sunglasses
are actually polarized, put them in front of the phone
screen and turn the glasses. If they're polarized,
you're going to see a change in the
light, either the color or the brightness. The light from
most phone screens is polarized, meaning the
light waves are aligned along a specific direction. Polarized sunglasses
let through light that is polarized in one direction. It's the same thing that
these polarizing filters do, but most people don't
keep polarizing filters in their purse. I do. So caveat to this trick. Screen protectors tend to make
the light from your phone more randomly polarized. So this trick may
work differently if you have a screen protector. But you can still
look at a reflection from glass or water
or a car window, because on some surfaces
at the right angle, you'll see changes
in the reflection as you turn the
polarized glasses. Oh yeah, so at the
farmer's market, the glasses were not polarized. And I told them so,
because in real life, I am like you guys
are in my comments. They started explaining to
me what polarization was and how it works. And eventually were removing
glasses from their shelves. Whoops! When you're putting
away your headphones, instead of wrapping them
in a loop, make a figure eight around your fingers. After a day of carrying
around your stuff, they're going to end
up much less tangled. This is the one I
was so excited about, because I've been
doing it for weeks and I can't believe
how it works. But it does. Why? Because your headphones
are like a flat ribbon. By wrapping them
in a circle, you introduce a bunch of twists. So when you straighten
them, the twists stay there. That doesn't happen
with a figure eight. Physicists have actually studied
why headphones get so tangled and it has to do with the
ends poking through the loops. That makes knots
and then you end up with twisted tangles
in your knots. So an added bonus
of the figure eight is that though you get knots,
your knots aren't all twisted. And you're making smaller loops. Harder for the ends to find. Boom! When you first get
in a hot car, you might want to just blast the AC. But you're still keeping
the hot air inside. So open those windows. And you may not have
checked this setting. Recycling the hot
air is just fighting against thermodynamics. So take in the cooler
air from outside first. Then, once it cools
down inside, recycle. The air gets hot inside a parked
car in the first place because of the greenhouse effect. High energy light
comes in the windows, gets absorbed by
your seats and stuff, and then some low energy
light is re-emitted but can't get back out the windows. So the inside gets hot. So let out the hot air first. To avoid getting
shocked by your car while getting out of
it on a cold, dry day, touch the outside of the
door frame as you get out. That allows the
static charge caused by sliding across the seat
to flow into the metal frame through your hand. So it never has a chance
to build up and shock you. It even works if
you're riding shotgun. Sorry. That one was a stretch. To remove the residue from an
old sticker, put some oil on it and rub it off. Or WD-40. I had no idea why this works. It's chemistry. So here to help me
explain is Elaine from the channel Reactions. ELAINE: So why does oil
remove sticker residue? Well, it all comes
down to the principle that like dissolves like. Water and things that
dissolve in water-- like sugar and salt-- are polar. Oil and water don't
mix, because oil is non-polar and water's polar. Adhesives that don't resolve
with water are non-polar. So putting the non-polar oil
with the non-polar adhesive mixes the two likes
together and allows you to easily wipe it away. Acetone, or nail polish
remover, can also works, since it's non-polar, too. However, nail polish remover
tends to dry out your skin. But that's a whole other story
for a completely different day.  Thank you, Elaine. That was awesome. I didn't know that's
why that trick worked. Check out Reactions. I'm going to put a link
in the description. We made it to the end
of the life hacks video! Do you have any life hacks? I know you have some lame
ones, because I tweeted out asking if you had any lame life
hacks and I got these gems. Tweet me @thephysicsgirl
with your hashtag, #lamelifehacks or
some legit life hacks related to science with
hashtag #sciencelifehacks. And put down that
pen that you're using to carefully think
of and curate the comments that you're going to

talk directly to you guys that often because my

hearing from you guys. So if you want to send
me letters, puns, science experiments, questions,
photos, hilarious drawings of your unique theories. I really, really
appreciated the letters you guys have sent so far. You have a lot of

cat's favorite theory? Tune back in next episode to

**Transcript**:
To boldly go where no man has gone before
is no small feat, given that since the development of space travel, only three countries have
launched a human into space. The first was Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagari,
who orbited the Earth in the Vostok 1 spacecraft on April 12, 1961. Only weeks later, the US launched their first
human into space, Alan Shepard, aboard the Freedom 7. It wouldn’t be until 2003 that China would
launch its first man into space, when the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft successfully took astronaut
Yang Liwei on a 21-hour mission to space and back. With revitalized space programs and private
sector space aspirations, developments over the next few years might just make space great
again. Today we’ll compare a veteran space program
with a relatively new kid on the block, in this episode of The Infographics Show, NASA
vs. SpaceX. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with a brief history of each
program. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, was created in 1958 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics
and Space Act. According to the act, NASA’s space exploration
would forever be “devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” It wasn’t until July 20, 1969, that NASA
would iconize space travel when it launched the Apollo 11 into space and made the first
successful moon landing. SpaceX, created by multitalented tech entrepreneur
Elon Musk, was founded on May 6, 2002. Musk’s mission is to eventually colonize
Mars, having stated on numerous occasions that human extinction on planet Earth is inevitable. SpaceX is, of course, a ways away from achieving
this goal, and while it hasn’t yet launched flesh and blood into space, it intends to
do so in the second quarter of next year. Musk has also said that by 2024, SpaceX will
have completed a manned mission to Mars. Moreover, he has boldly proclaimed that in
50 years’ time, his company’s Interplanetary Transport System will be delivering up to
a million people to the Mars Colony. Musk may seem overly ambitious compared to
NASA, whose website states that it won’t be until the 2030s until its sending people
to the Red Planet. Does this mean NASA and SpaceX are competitors? In some ways yes, as NASA is a government
agency and SpaceX is a private entity. The media has referred to this competition
as the first public-private space race. The phrase was dubbed, however, not because
of Mars ambitions, but after SpaceX announced in 2017 it will be taking people around the
moon in 2018. The main difference being that they would
not only be trained astronauts but extremely wealthy space tourists. NASA had before this announcement made it
known that it too would take tourists around the moon, but not until 2019. The question we now must ask is, who has the
most funding and who owns the more advanced technology to make space tourism happen? In terms of the balance sheet, SpaceX raised
over $1 billion in funding in 2015 with 11 investors taking part. Elon Musk himself is worth over 17 billion
dollars. The tech maverick has his hand in many pots,
including his venture into the self-driving car market with his Tesla Motors company. How does SpaceX actually make money while
piling it into developments and the millions it costs to launch? The answer is sending commercial satellites
into space, with investor analysis media Motley Fool claiming SpaceX charges around $62 million
per launch. SpaceX charges the government around $20 million
dollars every time it sends supplies to the International Space Station or launches satellites
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As of June 2017, SpaceX had launched rockets
into space 41 times, with this year looking to be a record for the number of space flights. According to SpaceX president, Gwynne Shotwell,
the company will launch every two to three weeks in 2017. According to Motley Fool, the total revenue
for SpaceX is around $1.3 billion with $195 million in annual profits. Over the years, NASA has suffered from underfunding,
which is one of the reasons why progress regarding the exploration of space has been ponderous
since the moon landing. In 2016, President Barack Obama bolstered
NASA’s ambitions with an increased budget of around half a billion dollars, bringing
the total budget to around 19 billion dollars. This was good news for NASA, spurring its
administrator, Charlie Bolden, to announce publicly, “NASA is firmly on a journey to
Mars. Make no mistake, this journey will help guide
and define our generation." We should note here that while there may be
a race to space between the private and the public in SpaceX and NASA, the former and
other public companies are working with NASA to make the Mars dream come true. NASA has had plenty of setbacks besides underfunding. This includes the loss of two of its space
shuttles in 1986 and 2003. Fourteen astronauts were killed in total,
which didn’t help NASA’s ambitions. NASA has launched well over 100 crewed missions
to space and over one thousand unmanned missions. NASA’s last manned space shuttle launch
was with its Space Transportation System in 2011. If you are wondering how astronauts or cosmonauts
these days get to the International Space Station and back down to Earth, they travel
on the Soyuz Russian spacecraft. Currently NASA is not sending humans into
space, although running the space station and most space-related activities are a collaboration
between NASA, Russia, and other countries. NASA had originally said it would again be
sending humans into space in 2021 aboard the Orion spacecraft, but that date has reportedly
been moved forward to 2019. Perhaps NASA’s greatest recent success was
the 2011 launch of its planetary rover and the current work it does on Mars. Named the Curiosity, the rover is five times
larger than previous rovers that were sent to explore the Red Planet. You might also be asking yourself, what is
the difference between an astronaut and a cosmonaut? The answer is not much; astronauts are trained
and certified through NASA and other countries’ space programs, while cosmonauts are trained
solely through Russia’s space program. Let’s now take a look at recent developments
and an inventory of rocket stock. SpaceX’s grandest creation so far is its
Falcon Heavy large payload rocket which is scheduled to launch within the next month
or two. The rocket is designed to carry people, and
it’s with this rocket that SpaceX sees the future. SpaceX also has a free-flying spacecraft called
Dragon, which was the first commercial spacecraft ever launched by a private company. It currently only carries cargo, but SpaceX
believes it will be ready for human space travel by as early as 2018. The Dragon can be carried on the Falcon heavy
rocket, or on SpaceX’s other rocket, the Falcon 9. The history of NASA’s space missions is
a long and fascinating story, and it is the reason for much of our understanding of space. For instance, NASA’s space probe, Voyager,
reached the outer planets of Jupiter and Saturn, and 39 years later it’s still out there
navigating interstellar space. Voyager 2 was launched soon after and was
the first spacecraft to rub shoulders with Uranus and Neptune. NASA currently has a space probe, Juno, orbiting
Jupiter, while another record was broken in 2015 when NASA’s New Horizons space probe
did a fly-by of the Pluto system. Travelling at over 36,000 miles per hour,
it made history when it came within 6,000 miles of Pluto. The journey was an astounding 3 billion miles. NASA’s current biggest development is the
Orion launch, which will take four astronauts beyond the moon, according to NASA. Other main developments are related to research
aboard the International Space Station, global aviation, and emerging technologies such as
robotics. NASA has achieved truly incredible things,
but will the organization have to move over for Elon Musk’s amazing spacecraft technologies? In 2017, rumors surfaced that Donald Trump’s
administration wants to return to the moon, but will it be with a NASA or SpaceX vehicle? Some critics believe America is big enough
for two space programs, public and private, and there’s enough room on the moon for
two future landings. Others have suggested NASA should keep its
focus on exploring deep space, while manned space travel and the possibility of a human
colony on Mars should be handled by other agencies. How do you think these two programs should
move into the future? Should NASA and SpaceX share the same space,
or should each know its own place? Let us know in the comments! And if you liked this video, be sure to check

**Transcript**:
To boldly go where no man has gone before
is no small feat, given that since the development of space travel, only three countries have
launched a human into space. The first was Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagari,
who orbited the Earth in the Vostok 1 spacecraft on April 12, 1961. Only weeks later, the US launched their first
human into space, Alan Shepard, aboard the Freedom 7. It wouldn’t be until 2003 that China would
launch its first man into space, when the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft successfully took astronaut
Yang Liwei on a 21-hour mission to space and back. With revitalized space programs and private
sector space aspirations, developments over the next few years might just make space great
again. Today we’ll compare a veteran space program
with a relatively new kid on the block, in this episode of The Infographics Show, NASA
vs. SpaceX. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with a brief history of each
program. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, was created in 1958 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics
and Space Act. According to the act, NASA’s space exploration
would forever be “devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” It wasn’t until July 20, 1969, that NASA
would iconize space travel when it launched the Apollo 11 into space and made the first
successful moon landing. SpaceX, created by multitalented tech entrepreneur
Elon Musk, was founded on May 6, 2002. Musk’s mission is to eventually colonize
Mars, having stated on numerous occasions that human extinction on planet Earth is inevitable. SpaceX is, of course, a ways away from achieving
this goal, and while it hasn’t yet launched flesh and blood into space, it intends to
do so in the second quarter of next year. Musk has also said that by 2024, SpaceX will
have completed a manned mission to Mars. Moreover, he has boldly proclaimed that in
50 years’ time, his company’s Interplanetary Transport System will be delivering up to
a million people to the Mars Colony. Musk may seem overly ambitious compared to
NASA, whose website states that it won’t be until the 2030s until its sending people
to the Red Planet. Does this mean NASA and SpaceX are competitors? In some ways yes, as NASA is a government
agency and SpaceX is a private entity. The media has referred to this competition
as the first public-private space race. The phrase was dubbed, however, not because
of Mars ambitions, but after SpaceX announced in 2017 it will be taking people around the
moon in 2018. The main difference being that they would
not only be trained astronauts but extremely wealthy space tourists. NASA had before this announcement made it
known that it too would take tourists around the moon, but not until 2019. The question we now must ask is, who has the
most funding and who owns the more advanced technology to make space tourism happen? In terms of the balance sheet, SpaceX raised
over $1 billion in funding in 2015 with 11 investors taking part. Elon Musk himself is worth over 17 billion
dollars. The tech maverick has his hand in many pots,
including his venture into the self-driving car market with his Tesla Motors company. How does SpaceX actually make money while
piling it into developments and the millions it costs to launch? The answer is sending commercial satellites
into space, with investor analysis media Motley Fool claiming SpaceX charges around $62 million
per launch. SpaceX charges the government around $20 million
dollars every time it sends supplies to the International Space Station or launches satellites

**Transcript**:
The sun is around 4.5 billion years old, and
just like you and I, it's aging. In just over a billion years, the sun will
have expanded so much that the heat will begin to melt the earth's surface. So, is there any way us Earthlings can avoid
this detrimental event? Can we save ourselves from the suns ultimate
death? Sure, none of us will be here, assuming we
don't find the secret to everlasting life. But, at the billion year mark, the sun will
have used up the hydrogen fuel in its core, forcing it to burn at its surface. The increased radiation will boil away all
of the water on Earth creating an international desert. Flash forward about 5 billion years, and the
swelling sun will begin literally melting mountains, with most, if not all life on earth
now extinct. Around 7.5 billion years, the expanding sun
- now a Red Giant - will engulf the Earth entirely. Sounds bleak -- so can we avoid this hot mess? It turns out; our best bet lies in something
called "Gravity Assist". A technique we've been using for years, only
to launch space crafts throughout our solar system. Anytime a spacecraft or satellite comes in
close proximity to a planet, gravity grabs hold. And if the spacecraft arrives at the perfect
angle, it's able to use some of the planets velocity to catapult it further into space. This 'extra' energy comes from the planet's
own energy of motion around the sun. But, as Newton famously said "To every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction". As the spacecraft uses the Earths gravity
to speed up and move towards Earth, the planet will ever so slightly slow down and move towards
the spacecraft. Of course, the spacecraft's mass is so small,
comparatively, that it gets launched incredibly far, while the planet experiences little change. But, if we were to increase the spacecraft's
size -- or use an asteroid -- we could potentially move the Earth's orbit away from the sun. This would take millions of years, and involve
large objects coming just close enough to not collide with Earth, but hey, we've got
a billion year head start! It may seem far-fetched, but it's already
happening! On October 9th, 2013, Earth will be used to
gravity assist a spacecraft called Juno, which is on its way to Jupiter. As Juno flies within 559 kilometers of us,
it will use Earth's gravity as a slingshot to boost its velocity by 7.3 km/s; Meanwhile,
Earth will have been moved by a fraction. Juno will later arrive at Jupiter, in 2016,
where it will study the interior of the planet and help to unveil many new spectacular mysteries
of our Solar System. In order to move the Earth within our billion
year timeline, we would need approximately 1 encounter every 6,000 years, using an object
with a mass of approximately 10^19kg. That's 19 zeros - somewhere around the size
of a 100 km-wide asteroid. In between passes, the asteroid would slingshot
around the sun, fly out to Jupiter, and then be gravity assisted back to Earth - like one
long version of catch between planets. Over millions of years, this would move Earth
to a comfortable 225 million kilometer orbit out from the sun. And while it is feasible, even with today's
technology, it doesn't come without risks. For one, we may lose the moon, which could
ultimately create some extreme weather patterns. Not to mention, the Earth's spin may increase,
making days only hours long. The surrounding planets, like our new neighbor
Mars, would likely have their own orbits destabilized. And...you know...the asteroid could come plummeting
into Earth by accident. But, perhaps these are the risks we need to
take to give our descendants, the planet and all life on it a few extra billion years. Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and
Twitter. And if you want to learn more about Juno? Check out its awesome interactive website

happening! On October 9th, 2013, Earth will be used to
gravity assist a spacecraft called Juno, which is on its way to Jupiter. As Juno flies within 559 kilometers of us,
it will use Earth's gravity as a slingshot to boost its velocity by 7.3 km/s; Meanwhile,
Earth will have been moved by a fraction. Juno will later arrive at Jupiter, in 2016,
where it will study the interior of the planet and help to unveil many new spectacular mysteries
of our Solar System. In order to move the Earth within our billion
year timeline, we would need approximately 1 encounter every 6,000 years, using an object
with a mass of approximately 10^19kg. That's 19 zeros - somewhere around the size
of a 100 km-wide asteroid. In between passes, the asteroid would slingshot
around the sun, fly out to Jupiter, and then be gravity assisted back to Earth - like one
long version of catch between planets. Over millions of years, this would move Earth
to a comfortable 225 million kilometer orbit out from the sun. And while it is feasible, even with today's
technology, it doesn't come without risks. For one, we may lose the moon, which could
ultimately create some extreme weather patterns. Not to mention, the Earth's spin may increase,
making days only hours long. The surrounding planets, like our new neighbor
Mars, would likely have their own orbits destabilized. And...you know...the asteroid could come plummeting
into Earth by accident. But, perhaps these are the risks we need to
take to give our descendants, the planet and all life on it a few extra billion years. Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an event that will not occur in 7.5 billion years, with options related to the sun's evolution and its effects on the Earth. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 2 discusses the effects of the sun's expansion on the Earth's surface in about 1 billion years.

Although it's not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the sun's evolution and its impact on the Earth. However, please note that the question intent, options, and content are not identical to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
One fine day, when Charles Darwin was still 
a student at Cambridge, the budding naturalist tore some
old bark off a tree and found two rare beetles underneath. He’d just taken one beetle in each hand
when he spotted a third beetle. Stashing one of the insects 
in his mouth for safekeeping, he reached for the new specimen – when a sudden spray of hot, 
bitter fluid scalded his tongue. Darwin’s assailant 
was the bombardier beetle. It’s one of thousands of animal species, like frogs, jellyfish, salamanders, and snakes, that use toxic chemicals 
to defend themselves – in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid 
from glands in its abdomen. But why doesn’t this caustic substance,
ejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself? In fact, how do any toxic animals 
survive their own secretions? The answer is that they use one 
of two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them. Bombardier beetles use the first approach. They store ingredients for their poison 
in two separate chambers. When they’re threatened, the valve 
between the chambers opens and the substances combine 
in a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that
protects the beetle’s internal tissues. Similarly, jellyfish package 
their venom safely in harpoon-like structures 
called nematocysts. And venomous snakes store their
flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments
that only have one exit: through the fangs 
and into their prey or predator. Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance. Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers
manufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom 
components in the blood. Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also
evolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism. These tiny animals defend themselves 
using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants. One of their most potent alkaloids 
is the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors 
in the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger. An amount barely heavier than 
a grain of sugar would kill you. So what prevents poison frogs 
from poisoning themselves? Think of the molecular target 
of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key. When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical 
and electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death. But if you change the shape of the lock,
the key can’t fit. For poison dart frogs and many other
animals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter
the structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin 
from exerting its adverse effects. Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance: their predators and prey can, too. The garter snake, which dines 
on neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance 
to salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes 
as the salamanders themselves. That means that only the most toxic 
salamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes
will survive the meal. The result is that the genes providing 
the highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations. As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race 
that plays out over millions of years. This pattern appears over and over again. Grasshopper mice resist painful 
venom from scorpion prey through genetic changes 
in their nervous systems. Horned lizards readily 
consume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting 
with specialized blood plasma. And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation 
with compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses. The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray 
that Darwin found so distasteful. Most of the beetles 
are spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well. But how do the toads 
survive the experience? That is still a mystery.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar.

Question 2 asks about how the bombardier beetle protects itself from its own poisonous secretions, and the correct option (B) mentions storing the ingredients for the poison in two separate chambers. Although this question does not directly ask how poisonous animals avoid poisoning themselves, it does touch on one of the strategies mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (securely storing their poisons).

However, a more relevant question that encompasses both strategies (securely storing their poisons and evolving resistance) is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it only partially addresses the ground truth MCQ. A new question that combines the intent of Question 2 and Question 5 (which addresses evolving resistance) would be a better match.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about an animal that eats highly toxic newts, and the correct answer is "highly resistant snakes." Question 6 discusses an example of an evolutionary arms race in the context of toxic animals and their predators or prey, specifically mentioning the toxicity of salamanders and the evolution of resistance in garter snakes that prey on them. 

While the options and the specific animal mentioned are not identical, the underlying concept of predators evolving resistance to prey toxicity is the same. Therefore, Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ.

old bark off a tree and found two rare beetles underneath. He’d just taken one beetle in each hand
when he spotted a third beetle. Stashing one of the insects 
in his mouth for safekeeping, he reached for the new specimen – when a sudden spray of hot, 
bitter fluid scalded his tongue. Darwin’s assailant 
was the bombardier beetle. It’s one of thousands of animal species, like frogs, jellyfish, salamanders, and snakes, that use toxic chemicals 
to defend themselves – in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid 
from glands in its abdomen. But why doesn’t this caustic substance,
ejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself? In fact, how do any toxic animals 
survive their own secretions? The answer is that they use one 
of two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them. Bombardier beetles use the first approach. They store ingredients for their poison 
in two separate chambers. When they’re threatened, the valve 
between the chambers opens and the substances combine 
in a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that
protects the beetle’s internal tissues. Similarly, jellyfish package 
their venom safely in harpoon-like structures 
called nematocysts. And venomous snakes store their
flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments
that only have one exit: through the fangs 
and into their prey or predator. Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance. Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers
manufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom 
components in the blood. Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also
evolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism. These tiny animals defend themselves 
using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants. One of their most potent alkaloids 
is the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors 
in the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger. An amount barely heavier than 
a grain of sugar would kill you. So what prevents poison frogs 
from poisoning themselves? Think of the molecular target 
of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key. When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical 
and electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death. But if you change the shape of the lock,
the key can’t fit. For poison dart frogs and many other
animals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter
the structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin 
from exerting its adverse effects. Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance: their predators and prey can, too. The garter snake, which dines 
on neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance 
to salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes 
as the salamanders themselves. That means that only the most toxic 
salamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes
will survive the meal. The result is that the genes providing 
the highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations. As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race 
that plays out over millions of years. This pattern appears over and over again. Grasshopper mice resist painful 
venom from scorpion prey through genetic changes 
in their nervous systems. Horned lizards readily 
consume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting 
with specialized blood plasma. And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation 
with compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses. The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray 
that Darwin found so distasteful. Most of the beetles 
are spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well. But how do the toads 
survive the experience? That is still a mystery.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and question intent, I can suggest a possible match.

The ground truth MCQ is about nematocysts, which are mentioned in the transcript as "tiny, poisonous, harpoon-like structures" found in jellyfish. Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 mentions nematocysts, but it's about how sea slugs resist the venom from jellyfish nematocysts, not about where nematocysts are found.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would suggest Question 3, which is about how a snake's venom is stored. However, this is not a direct match, as the ground truth MCQ is about nematocysts, not venom storage.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the location or function of nematocysts, which is not present in the provided options. Therefore, I must conclude that there is no direct match among the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to provide an index, I would suggest that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 7 (index 7), which at least mentions nematocysts, although the question intent is different.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try 
and post your results in the comments.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about determining the score for an n x n canvas, specifically for an odd n, and asks about the score that can be achieved.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent, as it discusses the uncertainty among expert mathematicians about finding the lowest possible score for a larger grid. However, it does not specifically address the score for an n x n canvas.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of question intent and content. In this case, I would recommend Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try 
and post your results in the comments.

However, this is not an exact match. A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the goal of having rectangles fall within a certain range of area values.

A more similar question is not present in the list, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of intent. It implies that the goal is to have a small range between the largest and smallest rectangles.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if we had to choose one, it would be:

 Question 3 is not the correct answer because the correct answer should have the phrase "fall within a _______ range of area values" to match the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will provide an alternative solution.

Alternative Solution:
Since none of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ, we can consider a question that has the closest meaning or intent.

In this case, I would recommend Question 3's intent but since the correct answer is not present we will look at another question.

However, another alternative could be to consider Question 10's statement that "It is more art than science" which in the transcript, is followed by the statement "And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether they’ve found the lowest possible scores. " and then "So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? "  and then "The goal is for all our rectangles to fall within a small range of area values."

So by using Question 10's statement as a proxy we could say that:

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: What is the lowest possible score achieved for the 8x8 canvas in the transcript? Options: A. 4, B. 6, C. 8, D. 10 Correct Option: B.

Although the canvas size in the ground truth MCQ (6x6) is different from the canvas size in Question 6 (8x8), the intent of the question is the same: to find the lowest possible score for a given canvas size. The options and correct answer also have a similar structure.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of canvas size and options. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 6.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try 
and post your results in the comments.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the smallest possible value for a 7x7 canvas, whereas Question 6 asks about the lowest possible score achieved for an 8x8 canvas. Although the canvas sizes are different, both questions are related to finding the minimum score.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that could be modified to match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is the lowest possible score achieved for the 8x8 canvas in the transcript? 

Although the ground truth MCQ asks about an 11x11 canvas and Question 6 asks about an 8x8 canvas, the intent of both questions is to determine the lowest possible score for a given canvas size, which makes Question 6 the most similar in terms of question intent and content.

However, if I had to choose a question that matches the exact intent of the ground truth MCQ (i.e., asking about a specific canvas size not mentioned in the generated MCQs), I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on similarity, I would choose Question 6.

rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try 
and post your results in the comments.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ is about splitting an n x n canvas in two and determining the maximum possible score. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, which discusses the strategy of dividing the largest rectangle into smaller ones and its effect on the score. However, it does not specifically address the case of splitting an n x n canvas in two.

A closer match is not available, but if I had to choose, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score

**Transcript**:
Cilantro is of the most common herbs in the
world, but unlike any other, this little leaf is infamous for it’s polarizing love-it-hate-it
reaction among foodies. It’s kind of like the Benedict Cumberbatch
of taco toppings. Today we’re taking a look at why such a
poor, innocent leaf can stoke such vitriol from the cilantro-phobes among us. This is Coriandrum sativum, an herb whose
leaves we’ve come to know as cilantro, and whose seeds are used as spice commonly called
coriander. Its love of warm weather lets it grow all
over the world, with the largest exporter being Mexico. So it’s no wonder you’re going to find
it in these. This little plant also comes from the same
family of aromatics as celery and parsley. But unlike parsley, which is probably one
of the most inoffensive plants out there, cilantro bares the burden of being one of
the most divisive herb known to humankind. Lots of people love its aromatic quality,
while others are totally repulsed by it. Every person has a different taste in food,
but this cilantroversy is so distinct in the population that it has led scientists to ask
whether there is an actual physical difference in cilantro haters. It’s been estimated that 4-14% of the population
can’t stand the taste of cilantro, but here’s where it gets interesting. Among that group of haters is a subgroup who
literally can’t help but hate it - they may have a genetic mutation that makes it
so. These folks describe the taste of cilantro
as soapy or dirt-like, terms that have a bit to do with the kind of smell you get from
raw fats, bugs, or cosmetics. And For the rest of us taco lovers, I know
this can seem like a huge disgrace, but I’m here to tell you today not to blame your cilantro
hating friend for their poor taste - these are matters that might rest far out their
hands of control. These haters may be coping with a small change
in their DNA called a single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP for short. Cilantro haters tend to have a different version
of a SNP in an area of chromosome 11 directly related to your sense of smell. This region contains the genes for several
odor detectors, and the culprit is thought to be OR6A2. The rodent version of this gene is known to
bind to a cilantro-abundant group of molecules called aldehydes, and common mutations in
the gene may change the way OR6A2 detects certain molecules in the aldehyde group, giving
people with these genetic changes an altogether different cilantro-sperience than the rest
of us. Aldehydes are cilantro’s primary odor-causing
compounds. Two compounds in this group, decanal and dodecanal
offer an earthy, sweet, green aroma. But the center of the cilantroversy is found
with the (E)-2-Alkenals, which give it that characteristically “soapy” taste. That SNP mutation mentioned earlier MAY cause
cilantro haters to experience these (E)-2-Alkenals differently than the rest of us, ultimately
making them the dominant flavor of the plant. But at this point, scientists haven’t discovered
the exact mechanism behind this soapy phenomenon. So when people out there say they hate cilantro,
now you know that it might not actually be their fault. They may be genetically programmed to taste
the stuff of soaps! What side of the cilantroversy are you on? Let us know in the comments. Have any other food related chemistry questions
you’re looking to have answer? Post them down there as well, and don’t

**Transcript**:
Cilantro is of the most common herbs in the
world, but unlike any other, this little leaf is infamous for it’s polarizing love-it-hate-it
reaction among foodies. It’s kind of like the Benedict Cumberbatch
of taco toppings. Today we’re taking a look at why such a
poor, innocent leaf can stoke such vitriol from the cilantro-phobes among us. This is Coriandrum sativum, an herb whose
leaves we’ve come to know as cilantro, and whose seeds are used as spice commonly called
coriander. Its love of warm weather lets it grow all
over the world, with the largest exporter being Mexico. So it’s no wonder you’re going to find
it in these. This little plant also comes from the same
family of aromatics as celery and parsley. But unlike parsley, which is probably one
of the most inoffensive plants out there, cilantro bares the burden of being one of
the most divisive herb known to humankind. Lots of people love its aromatic quality,
while others are totally repulsed by it. Every person has a different taste in food,
but this cilantroversy is so distinct in the population that it has led scientists to ask
whether there is an actual physical difference in cilantro haters. It’s been estimated that 4-14% of the population
can’t stand the taste of cilantro, but here’s where it gets interesting. Among that group of haters is a subgroup who
literally can’t help but hate it - they may have a genetic mutation that makes it
so. These folks describe the taste of cilantro
as soapy or dirt-like, terms that have a bit to do with the kind of smell you get from
raw fats, bugs, or cosmetics. And For the rest of us taco lovers, I know
this can seem like a huge disgrace, but I’m here to tell you today not to blame your cilantro
hating friend for their poor taste - these are matters that might rest far out their
hands of control. These haters may be coping with a small change
in their DNA called a single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP for short. Cilantro haters tend to have a different version
of a SNP in an area of chromosome 11 directly related to your sense of smell. This region contains the genes for several
odor detectors, and the culprit is thought to be OR6A2. The rodent version of this gene is known to
bind to a cilantro-abundant group of molecules called aldehydes, and common mutations in
the gene may change the way OR6A2 detects certain molecules in the aldehyde group, giving
people with these genetic changes an altogether different cilantro-sperience than the rest
of us. Aldehydes are cilantro’s primary odor-causing
compounds. Two compounds in this group, decanal and dodecanal
offer an earthy, sweet, green aroma. But the center of the cilantroversy is found
with the (E)-2-Alkenals, which give it that characteristically “soapy” taste. That SNP mutation mentioned earlier MAY cause
cilantro haters to experience these (E)-2-Alkenals differently than the rest of us, ultimately
making them the dominant flavor of the plant. But at this point, scientists haven’t discovered
the exact mechanism behind this soapy phenomenon. So when people out there say they hate cilantro,
now you know that it might not actually be their fault. They may be genetically programmed to taste
the stuff of soaps! What side of the cilantroversy are you on? Let us know in the comments. Have any other food related chemistry questions

[♪ INTRO] You know that horrible, sour smell that comes
from expired milk? Yeah. You only need to smell it once to make sure
it never happens again. Luckily, many food manufacturers put some
kind of Sell By, Best By, or Use By date on their products to tell you... well, actually, they don’t tell you much. These labels are mainly for quality and flavor
purposes, not safety. And a lot of common foods are edible past
what it says on the label. This can make it difficult to figure out what
you can eat and what needs to go in the compost bin. But understanding what’s happening chemically
when foods go bad, both before and after those dates pass, can help you out. A product’s real expiration date is tricky
to predict, because it can be affected by everything from the sanitation of the factory
to the temperature of your fridge. But a lot of it depends on what kind of food
you’re buying. Produce, for instance, can become unsafe anywhere
from hours to weeks after you buy it; a huge variation most labels don’t account for. Most of this has to do with when it gets moldy,
and not about things like brown spots. Although those don’t look pretty, they’re
harmless. Mold, meanwhile, can actually hurt you. Some strains produce substances called mycotoxins,
which can cause everything from skin infections to internal bleeding and death. And because produce is such a water- and nutrient-rich
home for mold, it can start growing as soon as 24 hours after you bring your produce home. And it grows even faster in warm temperatures,
like on your sunny kitchen countertop. Extending the shelf life of your produce is
pretty easy, though: Just throw it in the fridge. Chemical reactions happen more slowly at cold
temperatures, so it takes longer for mold to grow and reproduce in there. But it will grow eventually. And when it does, whether it’s after a day
or a few weeks, it’s time for the compost bin. Dropping the temperature might be a great
trick for a lot of food preservation, but if you want to really push back the expiration
date, you have to kill bacteria before letting them reproduce. That’s not easy with produce, but it’s
exactly how we treat milk. According to the label, milk is usually at
its best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how
you treat it, it could really expire a few days later, or earlier. Traditional milk goes through the process
of pasteurization, a heat treatment process that denatures enzymes in living bacteria
and renders them harmless. And it does a good job, but it’s not perfect. Some of those bacteria survive pasteurization,
and over time, they convert the sugars in milk into lactic acid. That’s what gives spoiled milk that sour
smell. Normally, this process takes a couple of weeks
and, typically, it’s still drinkable for around five days after the Sell-By date. But if the milk gets exposed to slightly warmer
temperatures somewhere along the shipping route, or if you run your refrigerator a few
degrees warmer, it can spoil faster. And while you’re probably not going to catch
anything life threatening from drinking spoiled milk, you can catch some brutal food poisoning. The good news is, it’s easy to tell if milk’s
gone bad. Just give it a whiff, and take in that lovely
lactic acid smell. Finally, while heat treatments are awesome
for getting rid of bacteria in milk, you’ll need a different strategy for meat. Typically, the Best or Use By dates on these
products is for a week or so past purchase. But while it’s often safe past then, it
doesn’t last for that much longer. That’s because meat is a prime breeding
ground for bacteria. It’s a wet, nutrient-dense home with all
kinds of fuel sources. For a few days, these bacteria won’t cause
you any trouble because there aren’t that many of them. But over time, they’ll multiply. And that’s when you get problems. Bacteria, like Psuedomonas or Lactobacilli,
feast on the meat’s surface, where there are free floating sugar molecules and light
weight compounds to nom on. Some of these bacteria can make you sick,
but they do at least announce their presence. As they break those compounds down, they leave
behind some nasty smelling byproducts. These have all kinds of shapes and compositions,
but they all fall into a category called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Normally, these VOCS smell like rotten meat. And because you find them when bacteria have
been chowing down and multiplying, there’s a pretty strong sign your meat has gone bad. Besides the smell, you can also probably tell
your meat has expired based on how it looks. For example, VOCs like hydrogen sulfide can
convert the natural muscle pigment in meat into something that looks more green. Typically, all this happens a few days after
the Use By date on that sticker. But if you notice any of those funky smells
or a little slime on your beef… it’s time for it to go, no matter when it happens. Food science can be tricky, and those ambiguous
labels don’t always help. Knowing a little bit about how and why food
expires can help you keep your fridge full for longer. But if you’re really uncertain… it’s
okay to play it safe. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! Scishow is a production of Complexly, which

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of produce and its spoilage.

The ground truth MCQ is: "Brown spots on produce are, for the most part, harmless."

The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is related to the topic of produce and its spoilage: "How does storing produce in the fridge affect the growth of mold?"

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3 is not the best match but Question 6 has a similar format, it is asking about a specific aspect of a food product (meat) and how to determine if it is still good, Question 3 is about milk: 

But a more similar question is Question 8 it talks about how some bacteria contribute to the spoilage of a food product (meat), the ground truth question is about the effect of brown spots on produce.

But the best match is not available, the question about the effect of brown spots on produce was not generated.

If I had to choose I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but I want to make it clear that it is not a good match.

its best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how
you treat it, it could really expire a few days later, or earlier. Traditional milk goes through the process
of pasteurization, a heat treatment process that denatures enzymes in living bacteria
and renders them harmless. And it does a good job, but it’s not perfect. Some of those bacteria survive pasteurization,
and over time, they convert the sugars in milk into lactic acid. That’s what gives spoiled milk that sour
smell. Normally, this process takes a couple of weeks
and, typically, it’s still drinkable for around five days after the Sell-By date. But if the milk gets exposed to slightly warmer
temperatures somewhere along the shipping route, or if you run your refrigerator a few
degrees warmer, it can spoil faster. And while you’re probably not going to catch
anything life threatening from drinking spoiled milk, you can catch some brutal food poisoning. The good news is, it’s easy to tell if milk’s
gone bad. Just give it a whiff, and take in that lovely
lactic acid smell. Finally, while heat treatments are awesome
for getting rid of bacteria in milk, you’ll need a different strategy for meat. Typically, the Best or Use By dates on these
products is for a week or so past purchase. But while it’s often safe past then, it
doesn’t last for that much longer. That’s because meat is a prime breeding
ground for bacteria. It’s a wet, nutrient-dense home with all
kinds of fuel sources. For a few days, these bacteria won’t cause
you any trouble because there aren’t that many of them. But over time, they’ll multiply. And that’s when you get problems. Bacteria, like Psuedomonas or Lactobacilli,
feast on the meat’s surface, where there are free floating sugar molecules and light
weight compounds to nom on. Some of these bacteria can make you sick,
but they do at least announce their presence. As they break those compounds down, they leave
behind some nasty smelling byproducts. These have all kinds of shapes and compositions,
but they all fall into a category called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Normally, these VOCS smell like rotten meat. And because you find them when bacteria have
been chowing down and multiplying, there’s a pretty strong sign your meat has gone bad. Besides the smell, you can also probably tell
your meat has expired based on how it looks. For example, VOCs like hydrogen sulfide can
convert the natural muscle pigment in meat into something that looks more green. Typically, all this happens a few days after
the Use By date on that sticker. But if you notice any of those funky smells
or a little slime on your beef… it’s time for it to go, no matter when it happens. Food science can be tricky, and those ambiguous
labels don’t always help. Knowing a little bit about how and why food
expires can help you keep your fridge full for longer. But if you’re really uncertain… it’s
okay to play it safe. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! Scishow is a production of Complexly, which

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of mycotoxins, although it does not specifically address the issue with mycotoxins on produce.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, which discusses how bacteria contribute to the spoilage of meat. While it does not specifically address mycotoxins, it does mention the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that give the meat an off smell, which is somewhat related to the topic of mycotoxins.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the topic of produce and mycotoxins, I would suggest Question 2, which discusses how storing produce in the fridge affects the growth of mold. While it does not specifically address mycotoxins, it does discuss the growth of mold on produce, which is related to the topic of mycotoxins.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] You know that horrible, sour smell that comes
from expired milk? Yeah. You only need to smell it once to make sure
it never happens again. Luckily, many food manufacturers put some
kind of Sell By, Best By, or Use By date on their products to tell you... well, actually, they don’t tell you much. These labels are mainly for quality and flavor
purposes, not safety. And a lot of common foods are edible past
what it says on the label. This can make it difficult to figure out what
you can eat and what needs to go in the compost bin. But understanding what’s happening chemically
when foods go bad, both before and after those dates pass, can help you out. A product’s real expiration date is tricky
to predict, because it can be affected by everything from the sanitation of the factory
to the temperature of your fridge. But a lot of it depends on what kind of food
you’re buying. Produce, for instance, can become unsafe anywhere
from hours to weeks after you buy it; a huge variation most labels don’t account for. Most of this has to do with when it gets moldy,
and not about things like brown spots. Although those don’t look pretty, they’re
harmless. Mold, meanwhile, can actually hurt you. Some strains produce substances called mycotoxins,
which can cause everything from skin infections to internal bleeding and death. And because produce is such a water- and nutrient-rich
home for mold, it can start growing as soon as 24 hours after you bring your produce home. And it grows even faster in warm temperatures,
like on your sunny kitchen countertop. Extending the shelf life of your produce is
pretty easy, though: Just throw it in the fridge. Chemical reactions happen more slowly at cold
temperatures, so it takes longer for mold to grow and reproduce in there. But it will grow eventually. And when it does, whether it’s after a day
or a few weeks, it’s time for the compost bin. Dropping the temperature might be a great
trick for a lot of food preservation, but if you want to really push back the expiration
date, you have to kill bacteria before letting them reproduce. That’s not easy with produce, but it’s
exactly how we treat milk. According to the label, milk is usually at
its best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how

**Transcript**:
An elderly woman named Rosalie 
was sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst 
to life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed,
not by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage 
was an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications 
that might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd 
of circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known 
as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired 
vision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes 
in vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years. We still don’t fully understand 
what causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them 
when others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies 
that these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated 
by imagination. Many other hallucinations, 
including smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas 
as real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter 
covers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing 
information from each of our senses. But even in people
with completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive
from incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve 
blocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with 
information from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,
but most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived 
of input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries 
to create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities 
become a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of
Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people who had normal vision 
and then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses
remembered images to compensate for 
the lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss 
often hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony 
of an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders 
like schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes 
of hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs 
like LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include 
the sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world 
can appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also 
act on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically 
only causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual
disturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate 
receptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions 
for all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations. But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct 
the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of hallucinations associated with Charles Bonnet Syndrome, while the generated MCQs do not directly address this topic. However, Question 1 mentions Charles Bonnet Syndrome, and Question 2 discusses a characteristic of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome.

Although there is no direct match, I would suggest Question 1 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it at least mentions Charles Bonnet Syndrome. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the duration of hallucinations associated with Charles Bonnet Syndrome.

**Transcript**:
An elderly woman named Rosalie 
was sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst 
to life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed,
not by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage 
was an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications 
that might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd 
of circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known 
as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired 
vision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes 
in vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years. We still don’t fully understand 
what causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them 
when others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies 
that these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated 
by imagination. Many other hallucinations, 
including smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas 
as real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter 
covers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing 
information from each of our senses. But even in people
with completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive
from incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve 
blocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with 
information from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,
but most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived 
of input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries 
to create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities 
become a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of
Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people who had normal vision 
and then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses
remembered images to compensate for 
the lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss 
often hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony 
of an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders 
like schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes 
of hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs 
like LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include 
the sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world 
can appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also 
act on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically 
only causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual
disturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate 
receptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions 
for all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations. But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct 
the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the above questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content, I can suggest a question that is somewhat similar.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the known causes of hallucinations, and the correct option is "All of the above" (Epilepsy, Narcolepsy, Schizophrenia). While there isn't an exact match among the generated MCQs, Question 6 mentions schizophrenia as a condition related to hallucinations, but it doesn't include epilepsy or narcolepsy as options.

If I had to choose a question that is somewhat similar, I would suggest Question 6, but with the caveat that it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you'd like, I can try to generate a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

for all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations. But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct 
the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.

**Transcript**:
Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call "eusocial" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor. In eusocial societies, the workers, soldiers, caretakers and reproducers are different not only in their behaviors but in their physiologies as well For instance, a worker bee can't reproduce at all. There can only be one reproducer: the queen bee, and her name is Beyonce. Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. "Wherever man is, there the ant is also." This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious. Stinging Ants Ants don't only live in dead trees. some living trees have made accommodations for them, too. Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it

**Question 1: What term describes organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively care for their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor?**

Although this question does not directly ask why honey bees are eusocial, it does describe the characteristics of eusociality, which is the underlying concept of the ground truth MCQ. The options provided in the ground truth MCQ (A. to maximize productivity, B. to take care of young cooperatively, C. to divide labor, D. a and b only, E. all of the above) are all related to the characteristics of eusociality described in Question 1.

Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it

**Transcript**:
Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call "eusocial" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor. In eusocial societies, the workers, soldiers, caretakers and reproducers are different not only in their behaviors but in their physiologies as well For instance, a worker bee can't reproduce at all. There can only be one reproducer: the queen bee, and her name is Beyonce. Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. "Wherever man is, there the ant is also." This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious.

Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. "Wherever man is, there the ant is also." This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious. Stinging Ants Ants don't only live in dead trees. some living trees have made accommodations for them, too. Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it

Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call "eusocial" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor.

**Transcript**:
You hear the gentle lap of waves, the distant cawing of a seagull. But then an annoying whine
interrupts the peace, getting closer, and closer, and closer. Until...whack! You dispatch the offending mosquito, 
and calm is restored. How did you detect that noise from afar
and target its maker with such precision? The ability to recognize sounds 
and identify their location is possible thanks to the auditory system. That’s comprised of two main parts: 
the ear and the brain. The ear’s task is to convert sound energy
into neural signals; the brain’s is to receive and process 
the information those signals contain. To understand how that works, we can follow a sound 
on its journey into the ear. The source of a sound creates vibrations that travel as waves of pressure 
through particles in air, liquids, or solids. But our inner ear, called the cochlea, is actually filled 
with saltwater-like fluids. So, the first problem to solve 
is how to convert those sound waves, wherever they’re coming from, into waves in the fluid. The solution is the eardrum, 
or tympanic membrane, and the tiny bones of the middle ear. Those convert the large movements 
of the eardrum into pressure waves 
in the fluid of the cochlea. When sound enters the ear canal, it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate 
like the head of a drum. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone 
called the hammer, which hits the anvil and
moves the third bone called the stapes. Its motion pushes the fluid 
within the long chambers of the cochlea. Once there, the sound vibrations have finally
been converted into vibrations of a fluid, and they travel like a wave 
from one end of the cochlea to the other. A surface called the basilar membrane 
runs the length of the cochlea. It’s lined with hair cells that have 
specialized components called stereocilia, which move with the vibrations of the
cochlear fluid and the basilar membrane. This movement triggers a signal 
that travels through the hair cell, into the auditory nerve, then onward to the brain, 
which interprets it as a specific sound. When a sound makes 
the basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves - only selected ones, 
depending on the frequency of the sound. This comes down to some fine engineering. At one end, 
the basilar membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short
wavelength, high-frequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrating only in the presence of longer
wavelength, low-frequency sounds. So, the noises made by the seagull 
and mosquito vibrate different locations 
on the basilar membrane, like playing different keys on a piano. But that’s not all that’s going on. The brain still has another 
important task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from. For that, it compares the sounds 
coming into the two ears to locate the source in space. A sound from directly in front of you will
reach both your ears at the same time. You’ll also hear it at the same intensity 
in each ear. However, a low-frequency sound 
coming from one side will reach the near ear microseconds 
before the far one. And high-frequency sounds will sound
more intense to the near ear because they’re blocked 
from the far ear by your head. These strands of information 
reach special parts of the brainstem that analyze time and
intensity differences between your ears. They send the results of their 
analysis up to the auditory cortex. Now, the brain has 
all the information it needs: the patterns of activity 
that tell us what the sound is, and information about 
where it is in space. Not everyone has normal hearing. Hearing loss is the third most common 
chronic disease in the world. Exposure to loud noises 
and some drugs can kill hair cells, preventing signals from traveling 
from the ear to the brain. Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze 
the tiny bones in the ear so they no longer vibrate. And with tinnitus, the brain does strange things to make us think there’s a sound 
when there isn’t one. But when it does work, our hearing is an incredible, 
elegant system. Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece 
of biological machinery that converts the cacophony of vibrations 
in the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulses that distinguish claps, taps, 
sighs, and flies.

and identify their location is possible thanks to the auditory system. That’s comprised of two main parts: 
the ear and the brain. The ear’s task is to convert sound energy
into neural signals; the brain’s is to receive and process 
the information those signals contain. To understand how that works, we can follow a sound 
on its journey into the ear. The source of a sound creates vibrations that travel as waves of pressure 
through particles in air, liquids, or solids. But our inner ear, called the cochlea, is actually filled 
with saltwater-like fluids. So, the first problem to solve 
is how to convert those sound waves, wherever they’re coming from, into waves in the fluid. The solution is the eardrum, 
or tympanic membrane, and the tiny bones of the middle ear. Those convert the large movements 
of the eardrum into pressure waves 
in the fluid of the cochlea. When sound enters the ear canal, it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate 
like the head of a drum. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone 
called the hammer, which hits the anvil and
moves the third bone called the stapes. Its motion pushes the fluid 
within the long chambers of the cochlea. Once there, the sound vibrations have finally
been converted into vibrations of a fluid, and they travel like a wave 
from one end of the cochlea to the other. A surface called the basilar membrane 
runs the length of the cochlea. It’s lined with hair cells that have 
specialized components called stereocilia, which move with the vibrations of the
cochlear fluid and the basilar membrane. This movement triggers a signal 
that travels through the hair cell, into the auditory nerve, then onward to the brain, 
which interprets it as a specific sound. When a sound makes 
the basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves - only selected ones, 
depending on the frequency of the sound. This comes down to some fine engineering. At one end, 
the basilar membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short
wavelength, high-frequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrating only in the presence of longer
wavelength, low-frequency sounds. So, the noises made by the seagull 
and mosquito vibrate different locations 
on the basilar membrane, like playing different keys on a piano. But that’s not all that’s going on. The brain still has another 
important task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from. For that, it compares the sounds 
coming into the two ears to locate the source in space. A sound from directly in front of you will
reach both your ears at the same time. You’ll also hear it at the same intensity 
in each ear. However, a low-frequency sound 
coming from one side will reach the near ear microseconds 
before the far one. And high-frequency sounds will sound
more intense to the near ear because they’re blocked 
from the far ear by your head. These strands of information 
reach special parts of the brainstem that analyze time and
intensity differences between your ears. They send the results of their 
analysis up to the auditory cortex. Now, the brain has 
all the information it needs: the patterns of activity 
that tell us what the sound is, and information about 
where it is in space. Not everyone has normal hearing. Hearing loss is the third most common 
chronic disease in the world. Exposure to loud noises 
and some drugs can kill hair cells, preventing signals from traveling 
from the ear to the brain. Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze 
the tiny bones in the ear so they no longer vibrate. And with tinnitus, the brain does strange things to make us think there’s a sound 
when there isn’t one. But when it does work, our hearing is an incredible, 
elegant system. Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece 
of biological machinery that converts the cacophony of vibrations 
in the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulses that distinguish claps, taps, 
sighs, and flies.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not specifically address the scenario of a sound coming from one side. Nevertheless, among the provided options, Question 4 is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

A more suitable match would be a question that specifically addresses the time difference between sound reaching the two ears when the sound source is on one side. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided options.

However, another option, Question 9, addresses a related scenario where the sound is coming from directly in front of a person. If we consider the implications of this scenario, we can infer that if the sound is coming from one side, it would not reach both ears at the same time, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the above analysis, the closest match to the ground truth MCQ would be a combination of Question 4 and Question 9. However, if we must choose one, I would recommend Question 4, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

Although the ground truth MCQ asks about the ranking of hearing loss among chronic diseases, and the generated MCQ asks about the consequence of prolonged exposure to loud noises, both questions share a common theme of hearing loss.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose:

**Index: 6**

Please keep in mind that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match might require rephrasing or re generating the MCQs to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Since the time of Homer, ancient stories told of fierce warriors 
dwelling beyond the Mediterranean world, striking fear into the mightiest 
empires of antiquity. Their exploits were
recounted by many epic poets. They fought in the legendary Trojan War 
and their grand army invaded Athens. Jason and the Argonauts 
passed by their shores, barely avoiding their deadly arrows. These formidable fighters faced off 
against the greatest champions of myth: Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles. And every single one 
of these warriors was a woman. The war-loving Amazons,
"the equals of men" in courage and skill, were familiar to everyone in
ancient Greece. Amazon battle scenes decorated 
the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis; paintings and statues of Amazons
adorned temples and public spaces. Little girls played with Amazon dolls, and Amazons were a favorite subject 
on Greek vase paintings. In Greek art and literature, they were depicted as daring 
and desirable, but also terrifying and deadly, and doomed to die 
at the hands of Greek heroes. Were Amazons merely figures of myth,
or something more? It was long assumed 
that they were imaginary, like the cyclops and centaurs. But curiously enough, 
stories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. And Amazons were described in ancient
historical accounts, not just myths. Writers like Herodotus, Plato, 
and Strabo never doubted their existence. So who were the real women 
warriors known as Amazons? Ancient historians located 
the Amazon homeland in Scythia, the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across 
the steppes of Central Asia. This immense region was populated 
by nomadic tribes whose lives centered on horses, archery, and warfare. Their culture flourished for about
1,000 years beginning around 800 BC. Feared by Greeks, Persians, and
the Chinese, the Scythians left no written records.
But we can find clues in how their neighbors described them,
as well as in archaeology. Scythians' ancestors were 
the first to ride horses and they invented the recurve bow. And, because a female mounted archer 
could be as fast and as deadly as a male, all children were trained 
to ride and shoot. Women hunted and fought alongside men,
using the same weapons. The harsh landscape 
and their nomadic lifestyle created its own form of equality. This amazed the ancient Greeks, 
whose women led restricted indoor lives. The earliest stories of the Scythians, 
and Amazons, may have been exaggerated rumors. But as the Greeks began to trade around 
the Black Sea and further east, their portrayals became more realistic. Early depictions of Amazons showed them 
with Greek weapons and armor. But in later representations, they wielded bows and battle-axes, rode horses, and wore pointed caps 
and patterned trousers characteristic of steppe nomads. Until recently, no one was sure 
how strong the links were between Scythians 
and the Amazons of Greek myth. But recent archaeological discoveries 
have provided ample evidence. More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,
or burial mounds, have been excavated, containing skeletons and weapons. Archaeologists had previously assumed that weapons could only 
belong to male warriors. But modern DNA analysis so far has revealed that about 300 skeletons 
buried with weapons belong to females ranging
in age from 10 to 45, and more are being found every year. The women's skeletons 
show battle injuries: ribs slashed by swords, skulls bashed by battle-axes, and arrows embedded in bones. In classical art and writings, the fearsome Amazons were always portrayed
as brave and heroic. In male-dominated classical Greece, 
however, the very idea of strong women who gloried 
in freedom and war aroused mixed feelings. And yet, the Greeks were also drawn
to egalitarian ideals. Is it possible that the mythic realm 
of thrilling Amazon tales was a way to imagine women
and men as equal companions?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the meaning of the term "Amazon." The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, which asks about the change in the portrayal of Amazons in Greek art and literature over time. However, this is not a direct match.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the origin or meaning of the term "Amazon." Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3, which asks about the factor that contributed to the relative equality between men and women in Scythian society. This question is related to the topic of Amazons and their culture, but it does not directly address the meaning of the term "Amazon."

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or Question 3, if we consider a broader topic relevance)

Note: The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the cultural and historical aspects of Amazons, rather than the etymology or meaning of the term "Amazon."

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that shares a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about an ancient Greek hero who did not fight the Amazons. While none of the generated MCQs ask this specific question, Question 2 mentions ancient historians who believed in the existence of Amazons, and it includes some names that are also mentioned in the context of the ground truth MCQ (e.g., Heracles is mentioned in the transcript as a champion of myth who faced the Amazons).

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that deals with the Amazons' interactions with ancient Greek heroes or the portrayal of Amazons in Greek art and literature. Question 5 discusses the change in the portrayal of Amazons in Greek art and literature over time, which is tangentially related to the ground truth MCQ.

Given the available options, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Since the time of Homer, ancient stories told of fierce warriors 
dwelling beyond the Mediterranean world, striking fear into the mightiest 
empires of antiquity. Their exploits were
recounted by many epic poets. They fought in the legendary Trojan War 
and their grand army invaded Athens. Jason and the Argonauts 
passed by their shores, barely avoiding their deadly arrows. These formidable fighters faced off 
against the greatest champions of myth: Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles. And every single one 
of these warriors was a woman. The war-loving Amazons,
"the equals of men" in courage and skill, were familiar to everyone in
ancient Greece. Amazon battle scenes decorated 
the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis; paintings and statues of Amazons
adorned temples and public spaces. Little girls played with Amazon dolls, and Amazons were a favorite subject 
on Greek vase paintings. In Greek art and literature, they were depicted as daring 
and desirable, but also terrifying and deadly, and doomed to die 
at the hands of Greek heroes. Were Amazons merely figures of myth,
or something more? It was long assumed 
that they were imaginary, like the cyclops and centaurs. But curiously enough, 
stories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. And Amazons were described in ancient
historical accounts, not just myths. Writers like Herodotus, Plato, 
and Strabo never doubted their existence. So who were the real women 
warriors known as Amazons? Ancient historians located 
the Amazon homeland in Scythia, the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across 
the steppes of Central Asia. This immense region was populated 
by nomadic tribes whose lives centered on horses, archery, and warfare. Their culture flourished for about
1,000 years beginning around 800 BC. Feared by Greeks, Persians, and
the Chinese, the Scythians left no written records.
But we can find clues in how their neighbors described them,
as well as in archaeology. Scythians' ancestors were 
the first to ride horses and they invented the recurve bow. And, because a female mounted archer 
could be as fast and as deadly as a male, all children were trained 
to ride and shoot. Women hunted and fought alongside men,
using the same weapons. The harsh landscape 
and their nomadic lifestyle created its own form of equality. This amazed the ancient Greeks, 
whose women led restricted indoor lives. The earliest stories of the Scythians, 
and Amazons, may have been exaggerated rumors. But as the Greeks began to trade around 
the Black Sea and further east, their portrayals became more realistic. Early depictions of Amazons showed them 
with Greek weapons and armor. But in later representations, they wielded bows and battle-axes, rode horses, and wore pointed caps 
and patterned trousers characteristic of steppe nomads. Until recently, no one was sure 
how strong the links were between Scythians 
and the Amazons of Greek myth. But recent archaeological discoveries 
have provided ample evidence. More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,
or burial mounds, have been excavated, containing skeletons and weapons. Archaeologists had previously assumed that weapons could only 
belong to male warriors. But modern DNA analysis so far has revealed that about 300 skeletons 
buried with weapons belong to females ranging
in age from 10 to 45, and more are being found every year. The women's skeletons 
show battle injuries: ribs slashed by swords, skulls bashed by battle-axes, and arrows embedded in bones. In classical art and writings, the fearsome Amazons were always portrayed
as brave and heroic. In male-dominated classical Greece, 
however, the very idea of strong women who gloried 
in freedom and war aroused mixed feelings. And yet, the Greeks were also drawn
to egalitarian ideals. Is it possible that the mythic realm 
of thrilling Amazon tales was a way to imagine women
and men as equal companions?

**Transcript**:
A hostile artificial intelligence called 
NIM has taken over the world’s computers. You’re the only person skilled 
enough to shut it down, and you’ll only have one chance. You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab, and now you’re floating in a raft on top 
of 25 stories of electrified water. You’ve rigged up a remote 
that can lower the water level by ejecting it from grates 
in the sides of the room. If you can lower the water level to 0, you can hit the manual override, shut NIM off, and save the day. However, the AI knows that you’re here,
and it can lower the water level, too, by sucking it through a trapdoor 
at the bottom of the lab. If NIM is the one to lower 
the water level to 0, you’ll be sucked out of the lab, resulting in a failed mission. Control over water drainage 
alternates between you and NIM, and neither can skip a turn. Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1, 3, or 4 stories at a time. Whoever gets the level
exactly to 0 on their turn will win this deadly duel. Note that neither of you can lower 
the water below 0; if the water level is at 2, then the only move is to lower 
the water level 1 story. You know that NIM has already computed 
all possible outcomes of the contest, and will play in a way that maximizes 
its chance of success. You go first. How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You can’t leave anything up to chance -
NIM will take any advantage it can get. And you’ll need to have a response 
to any possible move it makes. The trick here is to start from where 
you want to end and work backwards. You want to be the one to lower 
the water level to 0, which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4 when control switches to you. If the water level were at 2, your only option would be
to lower it 1 story, which would lead 
to NIM making the winning move. If we color code the water levels, we can see a simple principle at play: there are “losing” levels like 2, where no matter what whoever starts 
their turn there does, they’ll lose. And there are winning levels,
where whoever starts their turn there can either win or leave their opponent 
with a losing level. So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels, but so are 5 and 6, since you can send your opponent 
to 2 from there. What about 7? From 7, all possible moves would 
send your opponent to a winning level, making this another losing level. And we can continue up 
the lab in this way. If you start your turn 1, 3,
or 4 levels above a losing level, then you’re at a winning level. Otherwise, you’re destined to lose. You could continue like this 
all the way to level 25. But as a shortcut, you might notice that levels 8 through 11
are colored identically to 1 through 4. Since a level’s color is determined by
the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it, this means that level 12 
will be the same color as level 5, 13 will match 6, 14 will match 7, and so on, In particular, the losing levels 
will always be multiple of 7, and two greater than multiples of 7. Now, from your original 
starting level of 25, you have to make sure your opponent starts
on a losing level every single turn— if NIM starts on a winning level 
even once, it’s game over for you. So your only choice on turn 1 
is to lower the water level by 4 stories. No matter what the AI does, you can continue giving it losing levels until you reach 0 
and trigger the manual override. And with that, the crisis is averted. Now, back to a less stressful 
kind of surfing.

**Transcript**:
A hostile artificial intelligence called 
NIM has taken over the world’s computers. You’re the only person skilled 
enough to shut it down, and you’ll only have one chance. You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab, and now you’re floating in a raft on top 
of 25 stories of electrified water. You’ve rigged up a remote 
that can lower the water level by ejecting it from grates 
in the sides of the room. If you can lower the water level to 0, you can hit the manual override, shut NIM off, and save the day. However, the AI knows that you’re here,
and it can lower the water level, too, by sucking it through a trapdoor 
at the bottom of the lab. If NIM is the one to lower 
the water level to 0, you’ll be sucked out of the lab, resulting in a failed mission. Control over water drainage 
alternates between you and NIM, and neither can skip a turn. Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1, 3, or 4 stories at a time. Whoever gets the level
exactly to 0 on their turn will win this deadly duel. Note that neither of you can lower 
the water below 0; if the water level is at 2, then the only move is to lower 
the water level 1 story. You know that NIM has already computed 
all possible outcomes of the contest, and will play in a way that maximizes 
its chance of success. You go first. How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You can’t leave anything up to chance -
NIM will take any advantage it can get. And you’ll need to have a response 
to any possible move it makes. The trick here is to start from where 
you want to end and work backwards. You want to be the one to lower 
the water level to 0, which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4 when control switches to you. If the water level were at 2, your only option would be
to lower it 1 story, which would lead 
to NIM making the winning move. If we color code the water levels, we can see a simple principle at play: there are “losing” levels like 2, where no matter what whoever starts 
their turn there does, they’ll lose. And there are winning levels,
where whoever starts their turn there can either win or leave their opponent 
with a losing level. So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels, but so are 5 and 6, since you can send your opponent 
to 2 from there. What about 7? From 7, all possible moves would 
send your opponent to a winning level, making this another losing level. And we can continue up 
the lab in this way. If you start your turn 1, 3,
or 4 levels above a losing level, then you’re at a winning level. Otherwise, you’re destined to lose. You could continue like this 
all the way to level 25. But as a shortcut, you might notice that levels 8 through 11
are colored identically to 1 through 4. Since a level’s color is determined by
the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it, this means that level 12 
will be the same color as level 5, 13 will match 6, 14 will match 7, and so on, In particular, the losing levels 
will always be multiple of 7, and two greater than multiples of 7. Now, from your original 
starting level of 25, you have to make sure your opponent starts
on a losing level every single turn— if NIM starts on a winning level 
even once, it’s game over for you. So your only choice on turn 1 
is to lower the water level by 4 stories. No matter what the AI does, you can continue giving it losing levels until you reach 0 
and trigger the manual override. And with that, the crisis is averted. Now, back to a less stressful 
kind of surfing.

**Transcript**:
When Gustav Mahler was still alive in
the early 1900s, you see these caricatures of him and
it's crazy gestures his arms are up he's jumping up and down on the podium,
extremely large gestures. At the same time Richard Strauss another composer
living in the same city basically was conducting his own music like this. You know, barely moving and if you think this is a quiet part in his music you're
wrong. He thought the role of a conductor was to organize the music and keep
everything calm. Our biggest job as a conductor, it's to do justice to the
composer. My name is James Gaffigan I am a conductor. What the public needs to
understand about conducting is it's an anticipatory art, so what we do takes
place before the music happens. Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and
this hand will give a gesture before that sound. I've always found it strange to hold a baton and it's a very strange thing,
because why why is it there in the first place? But the fact of the matter is is
it is an extension of your arm. If you just make a gesture like this, you just
need to move your wrist and you don't have to be doing this all the time. Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm or keeping the beat patterns, so if you
give an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2
1 2 and you could be as small as this they'll realize that this is 2 4. From the left hand has a much more complex, strange role in our physical world and
it's freer to do things that are out of the
ordinary. It could be anything from showing where a phrase goes, it could show speed of a bow. String players are very physical in the sense
that they they react to what they see. If you have your left hand open and if you
have your right hand slightly open and you're holding this sound like as if
you'd hold a baby they'll play that way. If you conduct like this they're gonna play like this. Percussion needs clarity
from a conductor. They need to know where to hit something and the bass drum could
play only one note in an hour-long symphony, but that note is very important. The worst thing you could do to a brass
player before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they
have to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy
their confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a
delicate instrument, such a delicate moment. Leonard Bernstein was one of the
greatest musicians who who had ever lived, not just as a conductor but as a
pianist and as a composer. He was able to educate not just adults but children. Of
course when you watch him, he's always dancing and he can't he can't help
moving around the podium and his rhythm is contagious. Karajan believed in beautiful sound, upholstered sound, luxurious sound. So if
you hear some of the great recordings of Karajan, it's not always together at
these crucial moments but there's a beauty of sound always from beginning to
end. I mean he had his eyes closed half the
time and everything was he was just holding this precious thing all the time
and crouched over. Carlos Kleiber was all you know, he was holding a magic wand. He was fantasy, pure fantasy. He would make beautiful story lines to pieces
that didn't have story lines. He was all about this gesture and these beautiful
sweeping gestures. I don't believe in jumping around during a Bruckner
symphony, I think there's something sacred and it's unnecessary. I do believe
in having a great time with jazz music and music that swings. You should make
the audience want to dance although you shouldn't be a circus act. I think people
should focus on the music and not the conductor you

composer. My name is James Gaffigan I am a conductor. What the public needs to
understand about conducting is it's an anticipatory art, so what we do takes
place before the music happens. Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and
this hand will give a gesture before that sound. I've always found it strange to hold a baton and it's a very strange thing,
because why why is it there in the first place? But the fact of the matter is is
it is an extension of your arm. If you just make a gesture like this, you just
need to move your wrist and you don't have to be doing this all the time. Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm or keeping the beat patterns, so if you
give an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2
1 2 and you could be as small as this they'll realize that this is 2 4. From the left hand has a much more complex, strange role in our physical world and
it's freer to do things that are out of the
ordinary. It could be anything from showing where a phrase goes, it could show speed of a bow. String players are very physical in the sense
that they they react to what they see. If you have your left hand open and if you
have your right hand slightly open and you're holding this sound like as if
you'd hold a baby they'll play that way. If you conduct like this they're gonna play like this. Percussion needs clarity
from a conductor. They need to know where to hit something and the bass drum could
play only one note in an hour-long symphony, but that note is very important. The worst thing you could do to a brass
player before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they
have to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy
their confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a
delicate instrument, such a delicate moment. Leonard Bernstein was one of the
greatest musicians who who had ever lived, not just as a conductor but as a
pianist and as a composer. He was able to educate not just adults but children. Of
course when you watch him, he's always dancing and he can't he can't help
moving around the podium and his rhythm is contagious. Karajan believed in beautiful sound, upholstered sound, luxurious sound. So if
you hear some of the great recordings of Karajan, it's not always together at
these crucial moments but there's a beauty of sound always from beginning to
end. I mean he had his eyes closed half the
time and everything was he was just holding this precious thing all the time
and crouched over. Carlos Kleiber was all you know, he was holding a magic wand. He was fantasy, pure fantasy. He would make beautiful story lines to pieces
that didn't have story lines. He was all about this gesture and these beautiful
sweeping gestures. I don't believe in jumping around during a Bruckner
symphony, I think there's something sacred and it's unnecessary. I do believe
in having a great time with jazz music and music that swings. You should make
the audience want to dance although you shouldn't be a circus act. I think people
should focus on the music and not the conductor you

When Gustav Mahler was still alive in
the early 1900s, you see these caricatures of him and
it's crazy gestures his arms are up he's jumping up and down on the podium,
extremely large gestures. At the same time Richard Strauss another composer
living in the same city basically was conducting his own music like this. You know, barely moving and if you think this is a quiet part in his music you're
wrong. He thought the role of a conductor was to organize the music and keep

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC PLAYING] MATTHEW O'DOWD: This episode is
supported by Curiosity Stream. There's been a
lot of talk lately about putting humans on Mars and
even colonizing the red planet. Is this even possible? And what would that
settlement actually look like? [MUSIC PLAYING] Mars is getting a
lot of attention. NASA's new budget mandates
a 25-year timescale for putting astronauts
in orbit around Mars. That's exciting. But Elon Musk soon
followed with a rather more audacious announcement. SpaceX plans a spacecraft
capable of transporting 100 people at a time to Mars,
not to visit, but to settle. And it may be done in
as little as 10 years. The ultimate aim is for a
completely self-sustaining extraterrestrial colony
of a million people within several decades. That's some ambition. Here's the lowdown. Musk announced this in
an hour-long presentation that was almost entirely
about the vehicle. First step-- a spaceship is
launched into orbit by a rocket booster. The booster then
returns to its launchpad and is loaded with
a giant fuel tank. It relaunches and
delivers to the orbiting spaceship enough fuel for the
four-month journey to Mars. This is only feasible
because of the reusability of the components. That means many
return trips to Mars, but it also allows
the booster to carry the spaceship and the
fuel in separate launches. As a result, the
spaceship itself can have a much bigger payload,
translating to 100 passengers, rather than, say, the
four astronauts of NASA's proposed Orion module. Now, I could go into
all of the details. But honestly, you
should just listen to or read Musk's announcement. Links below. Is the vehicle
actually possible? Sure, probably. Whether 10 years is remotely
feasible is another matter. That's the lower in the
case that, as Musk puts it, things go super well. The plausibility of this may be
governed by whether a Martian colony could really work. Musk says almost
nothing about that, so let's get into that today. The vision is for a completely
self-sufficient settlement. Anything less would
defeat the main point-- to be a safeguard
against our extinction. It needs to be able to
thrive, even if Earth is lost. it needs to mine, farm, process,
and manufacture everything it needs. It also needs to be a place
that people might actually want to live. What would that look like? The initial habitats
are going to be simple. And in fact, the
first landers probably need to bring
habitats with them. That 450-ton cargo capacity of
the spaceship will help there. These may be inflatable,
modular structures, similar to those
proposed by Mars One, or like the Bigelow
Expandable Activity Module, BEAM, that's already in use
on the International Space Station. An important advantage of
prefabricating habitats on Earth is that you can use
advanced materials with better radiation shielding. Mars's thin atmosphere
and lack of magnetic field make shielding
critical, especially for a permanent settlement. However, to protect against
high-energy cosmic rays and solar outbursts and from the
micrometeorites that also pass easily through Mars's
thin atmosphere, we really just need
a very thick roof. That means either
living underground or building dense shelters
from local material. Becoming Martian mole
people may be the way to go. For one thing, Mars
does have lava tubes that could be populated. But with the advent of
large-scale 3D printing, it's possible to
build these structures on a planet's surface. NASA's 3D-printed
Habitat Challenge produced some
incredible concepts. Some proposed harvesting
the abundant iron and silica from the Martian soil to
print a variety of structures. The winner, however
was pretty unique-- a 3D-printed dome of ice, under
which pressurized habitats could be built. That's right. We may end up living
in Martian igloos. The water we'd need for that
is abundant as ice frozen within the Martian surface. That same water is
really what makes this whole endeavor possible. We need it to
drink, to grow food. But H2O may also
be the best supply of oxygen for, well, breathing. Mars's atmosphere is 96%
CO2, and the rest equal parts nitrogen and argon. But scrubbed of CO2, that
nitrogen-argon mix makes a breathable buffer gas that
we top up with 20% oxygen. It's been tested on
mice and crickets, so I guess we're good to go. Growing plants for food requires
water and air, but also light. So we need either transparent
greenhouse enclosures or artificially-illuminated
hydroponic farms. Modern hydroponic farms are
proving vastly more productive and require far less water than
their dirt-based equivalents, so that's a promising direction,
especially because it's hard to protect
against radiation with a transparent roof. Also, those plants will
help with oxygen production. Of course, all of
this requires energy, and this may be
the simplest part. Giant solar arrays stretching
across the Martian surface are the obvious answer. The one outstanding technical
issue is the gravity. Mars's gravity is 0.38
times that of Earth. We know that astronauts
lose around 2% of bone mass per month in
zero G. It's surely less on the surface
of Mars, but we just don't know how serious this
would be after many years. To build a sustainable
multigenerational civilization, it may be necessary to
simulate Earth gravity. This is possible using a
centrifuge, a rotating ring that results in the feeling
of an outward force, a centrifugal force,
with respect to the ring. This has been proposed
for artificial gravity on long-term space
missions, but it's also possible on a planetary surface. It would still involve
a large rotating ring, but with a sloped,
slightly curved outer wall so that the centrifugal and
gravitational accelerations work together to give you
the right direction of down on that surface. To avoid annoying daily
centrifuge visits, perhaps in the long term, we'll will
build entire centrifuge cities levitating on superconducting
magnetic rails and rotating once
every few minutes. On the other hand, watching
the entire sky rotate that fast may be as bad
for the stomach as 0.38 G is for the bones. We may want to keep that
thick roof of rock or ice. Martian cities are
technically doable, and people will
certainly want to go. 200,000 signed up for
the Mars One program. Really, the feasibility
of this is more a question of economics. Once we lose the
inexorable driving force that is Elon Musk,
a Martian settlement will have to be entirely
self-sufficient or economically productive enough to
justify continued life support from Earth. Whether that could
happen quickly enough is the real question. A lot of what we learn
about living on Mars will work elsewhere in
the solar system, too. In fact, the proposed
spacecraft is meant to be a general purpose
solar system explorer. Where would you go? Mars will be fun,
but we're really holding out for those
Venusian cloud cities here at Space Time. We want to thank Curiosity

series on Mars exploration and colonization. Jake at Vsauce 3
and I have chatted a lot about what humanity's
first experiences will be like when we go to Mars. Jake's take on this question
will be coming out real soon. The link will be right
here when it does. Keep your eye out for it. Last week, we talked about the
incredible, if speculative, possibility that primordial
black holes formed in the insanely dense conditions
right after the Big Bang and that these might
still be around today. I want to address
two big questions that you had in the comments. Several of you asked how
to tell the difference between a primordial black
hole and a black hole formed when a very massive
star ends its life. Well actually, a black
hole is a black hole is a black hole,
regardless of how it formed or what it formed from. Even a black hole made entirely
from light, a kugelblitz, is the same thing
as a black hole formed from regular matter. Black holes exhibit only
three properties-- mass, electric charge, and spin. You can learn something about
the formation of a black hole from those properties. Mass is one way to identify
a primordial black hole from a stellar black hole. A star's core needs to be more
massive than around three times the mass of the sun in order
to collapse into a black hole. Otherwise, it becomes
a neutron star. However primordial black
holes don't form from stars and so aren't subject
to this restriction. They could in
principle be any mass. Also, if we find
many PBH's spread through the galaxy and
even outside the galaxy, their distribution may tell us
that it was impossible for them to have been produced by
massive stars, which are rare, as far as stars go. A few of you also asked whether
the supermassive black holes that we find at the
centers of galaxies could be primordial black holes. Well, the answer is yes. But it's really hard
to say for sure. Those supermassive black holes
started as much smaller seed black holes. Those seeds may have been
from the very first generation of supernovae, near the
beginning of the universe. However, they may also have been
from PBH's from an even earlier time. Some scientists like
that idea because we see some pretty gigantic
supermassive black holes in the early universe,
and it's quite tricky to explain how they got that
big if they grew from only stellar mass black holes. Very large primordial black
holes may help explain this, but there's no
evidence for this idea. [MUSIC PLAYING]

mice and crickets, so I guess we're good to go. Growing plants for food requires
water and air, but also light. So we need either transparent
greenhouse enclosures or artificially-illuminated
hydroponic farms. Modern hydroponic farms are
proving vastly more productive and require far less water than
their dirt-based equivalents, so that's a promising direction,
especially because it's hard to protect
against radiation with a transparent roof. Also, those plants will
help with oxygen production. Of course, all of
this requires energy, and this may be
the simplest part. Giant solar arrays stretching
across the Martian surface are the obvious answer. The one outstanding technical
issue is the gravity. Mars's gravity is 0.38
times that of Earth. We know that astronauts
lose around 2% of bone mass per month in
zero G. It's surely less on the surface
of Mars, but we just don't know how serious this
would be after many years. To build a sustainable
multigenerational civilization, it may be necessary to
simulate Earth gravity. This is possible using a
centrifuge, a rotating ring that results in the feeling
of an outward force, a centrifugal force,
with respect to the ring. This has been proposed
for artificial gravity on long-term space
missions, but it's also possible on a planetary surface. It would still involve
a large rotating ring, but with a sloped,
slightly curved outer wall so that the centrifugal and
gravitational accelerations work together to give you
the right direction of down on that surface. To avoid annoying daily
centrifuge visits, perhaps in the long term, we'll will
build entire centrifuge cities levitating on superconducting
magnetic rails and rotating once
every few minutes. On the other hand, watching
the entire sky rotate that fast may be as bad
for the stomach as 0.38 G is for the bones. We may want to keep that
thick roof of rock or ice. Martian cities are
technically doable, and people will
certainly want to go. 200,000 signed up for
the Mars One program. Really, the feasibility
of this is more a question of economics. Once we lose the
inexorable driving force that is Elon Musk,
a Martian settlement will have to be entirely
self-sufficient or economically productive enough to
justify continued life support from Earth. Whether that could
happen quickly enough is the real question. A lot of what we learn
about living on Mars will work elsewhere in
the solar system, too. In fact, the proposed
spacecraft is meant to be a general purpose
solar system explorer. Where would you go? Mars will be fun,
but we're really holding out for those
Venusian cloud cities here at Space Time. We want to thank Curiosity

and I have chatted a lot about what humanity's
first experiences will be like when we go to Mars. Jake's take on this question
will be coming out real soon. The link will be right
here when it does. Keep your eye out for it. Last week, we talked about the
incredible, if speculative, possibility that primordial
black holes formed in the insanely dense conditions
right after the Big Bang and that these might
still be around today. I want to address
two big questions that you had in the comments. Several of you asked how
to tell the difference between a primordial black
hole and a black hole formed when a very massive
star ends its life. Well actually, a black
hole is a black hole is a black hole,
regardless of how it formed or what it formed from. Even a black hole made entirely
from light, a kugelblitz, is the same thing
as a black hole formed from regular matter. Black holes exhibit only
three properties-- mass, electric charge, and spin. You can learn something about
the formation of a black hole from those properties. Mass is one way to identify
a primordial black hole from a stellar black hole. A star's core needs to be more
massive than around three times the mass of the sun in order
to collapse into a black hole. Otherwise, it becomes
a neutron star. However primordial black
holes don't form from stars and so aren't subject
to this restriction. They could in
principle be any mass. Also, if we find
many PBH's spread through the galaxy and
even outside the galaxy, their distribution may tell us
that it was impossible for them to have been produced by
massive stars, which are rare, as far as stars go. A few of you also asked whether
the supermassive black holes that we find at the
centers of galaxies could be primordial black holes. Well, the answer is yes. But it's really hard
to say for sure. Those supermassive black holes
started as much smaller seed black holes. Those seeds may have been
from the very first generation of supernovae, near the
beginning of the universe. However, they may also have been
from PBH's from an even earlier time. Some scientists like
that idea because we see some pretty gigantic
supermassive black holes in the early universe,
and it's quite tricky to explain how they got that
big if they grew from only stellar mass black holes. Very large primordial black
holes may help explain this, but there's no
evidence for this idea. [MUSIC PLAYING]

**Transcript**:
The breakfast table’s probably the last
place you'd expect to find cool physics, but there is some awesome science happening right
here, and you’ve probably seen lots of times without even realizing it. Ever notice how cereal tends to stick together
in the middle of the bowl? Or it clumps to the edges. That makes it easy to eat, but why does it
happen? We see this same clumpage with other objects
too: paper clips, thumb tacks, even bubbles in a beverage will snap together. Maybe you’ve noticed this, but scientists
didn’t fully understand what was going on until 2005, when a pair of mathematicians
decided to hit the lab, it hthe kitchen, and hit the books. What they found is cool. I’m super cereal. Check this out. Breakfast cereal is less dense than water
(and milk is mostly water). It’s buoyant, it weighs less than the milk
it displaces. That force of buoyancy pushes up on each ring,
until it matches the downward force of gravity. This interaction holds the Cheerios at the
surface of the liquid, like little toasty rafts drifting together on top of a sea of
cereal milk (mmmm cereal milk). It's a really complicated way of saying cereal
floats. But look closely at where the cereal meets
the liquid. It’s curved up. The same thing happens at the edge of the
container, thanks to the meniscus effect. Water molecules are sticky – they’re attracted
to each other, but they’re even more attracted to the edges of your bowl or glass, or to
the edge of the cereal itself. That “adhesion” forms a U-shape wherever
the liquid meets an edge. A buoyant object will always be pushed up
the liquid to the highest point on a meniscus. That’s what makes them stick to the edge,
and what causes the cheerios to become cheeri-amigos. Any two nearby Os are pushed to a high point
between them, and clumps are pushed towards the overall highest point in the bowl, around
the edge. Let’s try something denser. I don’t recommend eating paperclips, but
toss them in water and they sink. Place them carefully though, and you can get
them to float. They’re too dense to be buoyant, they float
because of surface tension. Water molecules like to stick to each other
so much, they can behave like a membrane that’s strong enough to hold up tiny things. Let’s try it with these thumbtacks. Like the paper clips, you can see they’re
pushing that membrane dow, just not hard enough to break through. If I place another one nearby, watch what
happens. They’re attracted to each other, just like
the Cheerios. But the water around each one is curving down. Instead of climbing up the water like cereal
did, they fall into each other’s sinkhole. We can mess this scenario up just by adding
soap. The chemical properties of soap lower the
surface tension of water, so anything relying on surface tension to stay afloat will sink. But buoyant objects don’t rely on surface
tension, so they continue surfing the meniscus. The first time I did this, I wondered if the
tacks were being pulled together by static attraction on the plastic coating or something. So I put in just the plastic bit to see. But instead of being pulled toward the tacks,
something strange happened… they repelled each other. The same thing happens with Cheerios and a
paper clip. That’s because light, floaty objects run
away from the low points caused by the heavy objects. A buoyant object will always repel something
held up by surface tension’s stretchy membrane. Just to be clear, you should never put thumbtacks
in your cereal. But this is what would happen if you did. All of this made me wonder: What could happen
if we could reverse the direction of water's meniscus? I coated this glass with a hydrophobic coating
that does just that. When I put thumbtacks on top of the water
in here, they floated to the edge instead of the center. And that buoyant object did the opposite,
it floated to the middle. So that’s cool and all, but does the physics
of cereal clumping actually matter in the real world? It does if you’re a tiny insect. Take water striders,. These pond skaters are nature’s Cheerios. They float so well that even a load 15 times
their body weight won’t make them sink. They can even jump on water. Tiny hairs on their legs trap air bubbles
and increase their buoyancy. They’re basically wearing swim floaties
on their feet. Other aquatic insects like water treaders
exploit surface tension, just like thumbtacks and paper clips. But they get in trouble when it’s time to
get out. Gravity is pushing them into the depressions
under their feet, but they’ve come up with a clever way to climb the meniscus. A running start doesn’t work. But by arching their bodies and lifting their
front and back ends, the bugs curve the water up, and are pulled to the edge just like the
Cheerios were. They’re carried uphill by a physics-powered
water escalator. That’s pretty cool. If you can find science like this at breakfast,
imagine what else you might see the rest of day. Try this for yourself, and see what other
floating objects you can get to attract or repel. Leave a comment and let me know what you find. And if you see any cool physics in everyday
life I should check out in a future video, let me know. Stay curious.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type 
of male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible 
for adult men. However, this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had been 
castrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes 
that would deepen their voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic 
voices were renowned throughout Europe, until the cruel procedure that created 
them was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting vocal growth can produce 
an extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices 
are already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two
major changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work,
and what causes these shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is
the result of many anatomical variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age 
and health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes. The larynx is a complex system 
of muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, 
the vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea, the tube that carries 
air through the throat. The folds are apart when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air 
against the closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating
the tissue to produce sound. Unlike the deliberate focus required 
for playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices. Rapid and small vibrations create 
high-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations 
produce deep, bellowing rumbles. Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles 
between the cartilages, we can stretch and contract those folds to intuitively play 
our internal instruments. This process is the same from 
your first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During puberty, 
the first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when 
your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and
opening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower, 
larger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic
in many males, whose high testosterone levels
lead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal protrusions 
called Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the homogenous tissue
covering the folds specializes into three distinct 
functional layers: a central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped 
in stretchy elastin fibers, and an outer layer of mucus membrane. These layers add nuance 
and depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain
more or less the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we experience the
symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers 
atrophy and decay. This decreased flexibility increases 
the pitch of older voices. But for people who have experienced 
the hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered
and outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their
vibrations, resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer healthy 
laryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control 
and causes breathy or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes 
are just a few of the factors that can affect your voice. But when kept in good condition, your voice box 
is a finely tuned instrument, capable of operatic arias, moody monologues, and stirring speeches.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type 
of male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible 
for adult men. However, this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had been 
castrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes 
that would deepen their voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic 
voices were renowned throughout Europe, until the cruel procedure that created 
them was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting vocal growth can produce 
an extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices 
are already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two
major changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work,
and what causes these shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is
the result of many anatomical variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age 
and health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes. The larynx is a complex system 
of muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, 
the vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea, the tube that carries 
air through the throat. The folds are apart when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air 
against the closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating
the tissue to produce sound. Unlike the deliberate focus required 
for playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices. Rapid and small vibrations create 
high-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations 
produce deep, bellowing rumbles. Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles 
between the cartilages, we can stretch and contract those folds to intuitively play 
our internal instruments. This process is the same from 
your first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During puberty, 
the first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when 
your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and
opening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower, 
larger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic
in many males, whose high testosterone levels
lead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal protrusions 
called Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the homogenous tissue
covering the folds specializes into three distinct 
functional layers: a central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped 
in stretchy elastin fibers, and an outer layer of mucus membrane. These layers add nuance 
and depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain
more or less the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we experience the
symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers 
atrophy and decay. This decreased flexibility increases 
the pitch of older voices. But for people who have experienced 
the hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered
and outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their
vibrations, resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer healthy 
laryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control 
and causes breathy or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes 
are just a few of the factors that can affect your voice. But when kept in good condition, your voice box 
is a finely tuned instrument, capable of operatic arias, moody monologues, and stirring speeches.

**Transcript**:
When Homer’s Iliad was first written 
down in the 8th century BCE, the story of the Trojan war 
was already an old one. From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales 
of the long siege, the epic duels outside the city walls, and the cunning trick 
that finally won the war. In the end, the magnificent
city was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? By the time the field of archaeology 
began to take shape in the 19th century, many were skeptical,
considering the epic to be pure fiction, a founding myth imagining 
a bygone heroic era. But some scholars believed that behind the superhuman feats 
and divine miracles there must have been a grain 
of historical truth - a war that was really fought, and a place where it happened. Frank Calvert was one such believer. He had spent his youth traveling 
and learning about ancient civilizations before accompanying his brother Frederick on a diplomatic mission to the northwest
Anatolian region of Çanakkale. It was here that Homer described 
the Greek encampment at the mouth of the Scamander river. And it was here that fate brought Frank 
into contact with a journalist and geologist 
named Charles Maclaren. Locals and travelers had long speculated that Troy might’ve stood on one 
of the surrounding hilltops. But Maclaren had been one of the first to publish a detailed topographical 
study of the area. He believed he had found the site – a 32-meter mound known 
by the name Hisarlık, derived from the Turkish word 
for “fortress.” Soon after meeting with him in 1847, the Calverts bought 
2,000 acres of farmland that included part of the hill. Before they could explore any further, the Crimean War broke out and forestalled their archaeological 
ambitions for several years. After the war’s end, Frank Calvert began to survey the site, but lacked the funds 
for a full excavation. This was where the wealthy 
German businessman and amateur archaeologist 
Heinrich Schliemann came in. At Calvert’s invitation, Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, 
and decided to excavate. Eager to find the ancient city, Schliemann tore massive trenches 
all the way to the base of the hill. There, he uncovered a hoard 
of precious artifacts, jewelry, and metalwork, including two diadems 
and a copper shield. Schliemann took full credit 
for the discovery, announcing that he had found Troy and the treasure of its king Priam. But the real treasure was elsewhere. When later archaeologists 
studied the site, they realized that the mound consisted 
of no less than nine cities, each built atop the ruins of the last. The layer Schliemann had uncovered 
dated back to the Mycenaean Age, more than 1,000 years too early 
for Homer. But inside the mound was indeed evidence for a city that had thrived 
during the Bronze Age, with charred stone, broken arrowheads, and damaged human skeletons 
suggesting a violent end. It was Troy VII, 
contained in the middle layers and now ravaged for a second time 
by Schliemann’s careless excavation. The settlement, 
spanning some 200,000 square meters and home to as many as 10,000 people, thrived until around 1180 BCE. Its position at the southern entrance 
of the Dardanelles strait would’ve made a formidable strategic 
location for both defense and trade. Most importantly, there are the remains 
of a massive fortification wall – perhaps the very same one from which Priam and Hector 
once watched the Greeks approach. Of course, it’s difficult to be certain that these ruins are the true remains 
of ancient Troy, and scholars still dispute whether the Trojan War 
as described by Homer ever happened. Yet the evidence is strong enough that UNESCO has labelled Hisarlık
the archeological site of Troy. Regardless of its identity, thanks to persistence, a bit of faith, and a lot of research, archaeologists are bringing 
the long-buried secrets of an ancient, lost city to light.

**Transcript**:
When Homer’s Iliad was first written 
down in the 8th century BCE, the story of the Trojan war 
was already an old one. From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales 
of the long siege, the epic duels outside the city walls, and the cunning trick 
that finally won the war. In the end, the magnificent
city was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? By the time the field of archaeology 
began to take shape in the 19th century, many were skeptical,
considering the epic to be pure fiction, a founding myth imagining 
a bygone heroic era. But some scholars believed that behind the superhuman feats 
and divine miracles there must have been a grain 
of historical truth - a war that was really fought, and a place where it happened. Frank Calvert was one such believer. He had spent his youth traveling 
and learning about ancient civilizations before accompanying his brother Frederick on a diplomatic mission to the northwest
Anatolian region of Çanakkale. It was here that Homer described 
the Greek encampment at the mouth of the Scamander river. And it was here that fate brought Frank 
into contact with a journalist and geologist 
named Charles Maclaren. Locals and travelers had long speculated that Troy might’ve stood on one 
of the surrounding hilltops. But Maclaren had been one of the first to publish a detailed topographical 
study of the area. He believed he had found the site – a 32-meter mound known 
by the name Hisarlık, derived from the Turkish word 
for “fortress.” Soon after meeting with him in 1847, the Calverts bought

**Transcript**:
This is me. I'm about to go scuba diving for the first time ever. I went in expecting muffled peace and quiet. I mean, one of the earliest documentaries
on underwater life was literally called “The Silent World”. “They roamed deep under the Mediterranean,
the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, in a mysterious realm, a silent world.” But as soon as I got down a few yards, I couldn't
help but notice sound all around me. It was hard to tell what direction it was
coming from, or how far away it was. It was coming from boats above me. As far as I can tell, the Earth’s water
is not as quiet as I thought. I’ve been binging this podcast all about
sound, and they've been looking into this too "From DeFacto Sound, you’re listening to Twenty Thousand Hertz: The stories behind the
world’s most recognizable and interesting sounds. I’m Dallas Taylor." So Dallas — life underwater can be pretty
loud, right? It can! Just listen to these toadfish— they oscillate
their swim bladders to make sounds that are loud enough to keep houseboat residents in
Sausalito, California up at night. Or these Barred Grunt fish, that make a grinding
sound with the teeth in their gullet. Or these snapping shrimp — they produce a sound by creating tiny popping bubbles with their claws. It’s been measured at 200 decibels. That’s louder than a gunshot. Light doesn’t penetrate very deep in water,
so a lot of ocean life has evolved to use sound as its primary sense. Because water particles are more densely packed
together than air, sound travels farther and faster in water. That makes it an efficient medium of communication
at any depth or time of day. “Let's say we had 440, like the middle
key of your piano, or whatever.” That’s John Hildebrand, he’s a professor
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He's an expert in the field of underwater
sound and how it’s used by and how it affects marine mammals. “If you looked at the wavelength of that
sound in air, that note, the 440 note, would be a little bit less than a meter long. In water, it's more like several meters
long.” What that means is that noise travels about
four times faster and farther in water than it does in air. In an experiment in 1991, sound emitted from
Heard Island was picked up at 16 sites in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It turns out that one of the most common noises
in the entire ocean that can be picked up almost anywhere these days, sounds like this: It's the sound of boats. Noise from ship traffic has doubled every
decade since the 1960s. “Basically, anywhere you go, the ambient
noise in the ocean is dominated by anthropogenic sound.” “Let's say I made a measurement 30 years
ago and now if I went to the same place and made the same measurement, it would be 10
dBs or more higher sound level than what I measured when I started my career. That’s spooky.” That’s a huge problem for animals that use
sound as their primary sense. Just listen to this audio of how noise from
a passing boat totally drowns out dolphin communication. But arguably the worst culprit of underwater
sound pollution is a process that sounds like this: This is seismic surveying. It’s a process that allows companies to
locate spots on the ocean floor where they can drill for fossil fuels. Boats with about 30-40 airguns that all go
off at once will move back and forth over large parts of the ocean. Bubbles from the horns expand and contract
typically every 10 seconds, creating a huge amount of acoustic energy that maps geological
structures deep in the ocean floor. And it’s about as loud as a jet at takeoff. This can go on for weeks at a time. A study of seismic survey noise between 1999
and 2009 found that airgun sounds were recorded almost 2500 miles away from the survey ship
itself. At some locations, they were recorded on 80
percent of days for over a year. And that changes how animals behave. A study by the Institute of Marine Science
at the University of North Carolina found that reef fish abundance decreased by 78 percent
during seismic surveying. This is what the reef looked like before seismic
surveying in the area. And this is what it looked like after. “Seismic surveying is a constroversial topic at the
coast and new research is only adding to the conversation. “One of those impacted is local fisherman
Jack Cox. He’s seen firsthand the impact seismic
surveying has on fish.” “It does something, that — we just don’t catch fish. For animals like whales — who rely on complex
sound communication systems to socialize, find food, and mate — that poses a huge
problem. If you watch this heat map from a study of
endangered North Atlantic right whales, you can see that shipping paths near Boston squeeze
the whales into a tiny space where communication is possible — it's about a third of what
it was without the ships. Susan Parks, a biology professor at Syracuse,
recorded right whale sounds throughout the early 2000s. And when she compared her audio to some that had
been recorded in 1956, she noticed that the older sounds were much deeper than her high-pitched
recordings. It turns out that the whales had started calling
at higher and higher frequencies in order to hear each other over the hum of ship noise. Apart from habitat displacement and communication
changes, there’s also evidence that boat noise simply stresses these whales out. After the September 11th attacks, researchers
in Canada’s Bay of Fundy compared underwater noise levels during a period of reduced ship
traffic to the stress-related hormone levels in the right whale population. They discovered a 6 decibel noise decrease
in the bay after 9/11, which correlated to lower baseline levels of stress related hormones. Effects like this go all the way down the
food chain. A 2017 study found that there were two to
three times more dead zooplankton after after a day of blasts from a single airgun. And the larvae of krill, which whales rely
on for food, were totally destroyed. In April 2017, Donald Trump signed an executive
order to open offshore drilling in the Atlantic. It directed the Interior Department to consider
allowing seismic exploration by 5 companies that had been blocked under the Obama administration. It’s getting widespread pushback in Congress
— there’s a bipartisan House bill and Democrat-led Senate bill to ban seismic testing
— but if those authorizations go through, companies could be conducting seismic testing
in the Atlantic by Fall 2017. So… is there any good news? Yes, there is. In 2014, the International Maritime Organization
adopted guidelines for reducing commercial ship noise levels with things like noise-muffling
propellers and insulated engines — though they’re not mandatory yet. A year later, the US Navy agreed to limit
sonar testing — which has been linked to whales stranding themselves on beaches in
habitats near Southern California and Hawaii — following a lawsuit from environmental
groups. And in June 2016, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration laid out an Ocean Noise Strategy Roadmap. It’s the start of a 10-year plan to assess
the human impact on underwater sound and the measures required to reduce it. Seismic surveys can work better, too. Norway has started multi-client surveys, so
that seismic data from a particular area is only collected once. US authorities are considering a similar process. The ocean is huge. We’ve explored less than 5 percent of it
so far. So it’s easy to forget that what we do on
the surface affects everything down below. But like plastic, chemicals, and waste, noise
pollutes our oceans. Understanding that is key to doing our part
to protect it. Thank you so much for watching, we loved doing

[MUSIC] You've fired up the grill, set up the badminton
net, are those dark clouds on the horizon? Don't check your phone, your nose knows! [MUSIC] Our noses can detect up to a trillion different
scents, and many of them are deeply tied to our memories and our emotions. Like your grandma’s
house, your first dog, or . . . the smell of rain. Storm winds carry an orchestra of separate
smells, but the earthy odor that precedes a storm can be traced to three chemical sources. Before a thunderstorm, you’re probably smelling
ozone, which interestingly gets its name from the Greek word meaning “to smell”. The
electrical charge of lightning high up in approaching storm clouds splits oxygen gas
into separate atoms, some of those can reform into ozone. It’s swept ahead of the advancing
storm by windy downdrafts, and down to your nose level. As rain begins to fall, a new smell springs
from the soil: the pleasantly pungent perfume we call “petrichor”. Petrichor gets half
its name from the ethereal essence that flowed through the veins of Greek gods and half from
the stones of the Earth, which pretty much captures both its science, and the powerful
feels I get when I smell it. When decomposed organic material is blown
airborne from dry soil, it lands on dirt or rocks, where it’s joined by minerals and
the whole mixture is cooked into a magical medley of molecules. Falling raindrops then
send those chemicals airborne right into your nostalgic nostrils. When there’s no rain around, those same
chemicals remain in the soil, where they signal plants to halt their roots from growing or
prevent seeds from sprouting when there’s no water to drink. Petrichor: it’s for the
plant that’s tired of waiting . . . to germinate. Bacteria in the soil also contribute to petrichor
by releasing a chemical called geosmin, that's the same compound that gives beets their earthy
flavor. There’s other purposes for petrichor besides
showering us with emotion. It thought to attract camels to desert oases, who slurp up and transport
the soil bacteria across the sands. Petrichor that’s washed into rivers and lakes also
seems to signal fish that it’s time to spawn. There’s nothing like a rainstorm to spark
a little romance, I guess. So next time you smell a summer storm a-coming,
take a minute to think about what that rock over there is trying to tell you. Stay curious. And smell ya later. Why are sharks so scary? Bloodthirsty beasts
just waiting out there in the waves to feast on human flesh. if only we could get rid of
these guys our vacations would be so much safer, nothing to worry about while we're
surfing and frolicking out there in the ocean. Except that's not the case. Crimson Eleven Delight Petrichor

**Transcript**:
His reign marked the beginning 
of one of history’s greatest empires and the end of one of its first republics. Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed 
his civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Find out in History versus Augustus. Order, order. The defendant today is Gaius Octavius? Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus... Do we have the wrong guy? No, your Honor. Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, 
was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar. He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s 
adoptive son and heir. And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted 
him additional honors. You mean when he established 
sole authority and became emperor of Rome. Is that bad? Didn’t every place have some king 
or emperor back then? Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown 
their kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people,
not the privilege of a ruling family. And it was Octavius 
who destroyed this tradition. Octavius was a model public servant. At 16, he was elected 
to the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship. He fought for Rome in Hispania 
alongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility 
of avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate
betrayed and murdered him. Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant 
who tried to make himself a king while consorting with 
his Egyptian queen Cleopatra. After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war 
that tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back 
to increase his own power. Antony was a fool. He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms 
for himself and Cleopatra. Isn’t that what Caesar 
had been accused of? Well... So Octavius destroyed Antony 
for trying to become a king and then became one himself? That’s right. You can see the megalomania even in 
his adopted title – "The Illustrious One." That was a religious honorific. And Augustus didn’t seek power 
for his own sake. As winner of the civil war 
and commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore 
law and order to Rome so that other factions 
didn’t continue fighting. He didn’t restore the law -
he made it subordinate to him! Not true. Augustus worked to restore 
the Senate’s prestige, improved food security 
for the lower classes, and relinquished control of 
the army when he resigned his consul post. Mere optics. He used his military influence 
and personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate 
military triumphs. He kept control of provinces 
with the most legions. And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position 
twice more to promote his grandchildren. He was clearly trying 
to establish a dynasty. But what did he do with all that power? Glad you asked, your Honor. Augustus’s accomplishments 
were almost too many to name. He established consistent 
taxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation 
by local tax officials. He personally financed a network of roads
and employed couriers so news and troops could travel
easily throughout the realm. And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous 
public buildings were constructed. The writers of the time were nearly 
unanimous in praising his rule. Did the writers have any other choice? Augustus exiled plenty of people 
on vague charges, including Ovid, 
one of Rome’s greatest poets. And you forgot to mention the intrusive 
laws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage 
between social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried. He was trying to improve the citizenry
and instill discipline. And he succeeded. His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded 
Rome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered 
as a model of civic virtue. His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless 
conquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy. Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform
commits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf 
of "the people," we have Augustus Caesar to thank. So you’re saying Augustus 
was a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing? We’re used to celebrating 
historical leaders for their achievements and victories. But to ask whether an individual should 
have such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial.

**Transcript**:
His reign marked the beginning 
of one of history’s greatest empires and the end of one of its first republics. Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed 
his civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Find out in History versus Augustus. Order, order. The defendant today is Gaius Octavius? Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus... Do we have the wrong guy? No, your Honor. Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, 
was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar. He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s 
adoptive son and heir. And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted 
him additional honors. You mean when he established 
sole authority and became emperor of Rome. Is that bad? Didn’t every place have some king 
or emperor back then? Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown 
their kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people,
not the privilege of a ruling family. And it was Octavius 
who destroyed this tradition. Octavius was a model public servant. At 16, he was elected 
to the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship. He fought for Rome in Hispania 
alongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility 
of avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate
betrayed and murdered him. Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant 
who tried to make himself a king while consorting with 
his Egyptian queen Cleopatra. After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war 
that tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back 
to increase his own power. Antony was a fool. He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms 
for himself and Cleopatra. Isn’t that what Caesar 
had been accused of? Well... So Octavius destroyed Antony 
for trying to become a king and then became one himself? That’s right. You can see the megalomania even in 
his adopted title – "The Illustrious One." That was a religious honorific. And Augustus didn’t seek power 
for his own sake. As winner of the civil war 
and commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore 
law and order to Rome so that other factions 
didn’t continue fighting. He didn’t restore the law -
he made it subordinate to him! Not true. Augustus worked to restore 
the Senate’s prestige, improved food security 
for the lower classes, and relinquished control of 
the army when he resigned his consul post. Mere optics. He used his military influence 
and personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate 
military triumphs. He kept control of provinces 
with the most legions. And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position 
twice more to promote his grandchildren. He was clearly trying 
to establish a dynasty. But what did he do with all that power? Glad you asked, your Honor. Augustus’s accomplishments 
were almost too many to name. He established consistent 
taxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation 
by local tax officials. He personally financed a network of roads
and employed couriers so news and troops could travel
easily throughout the realm. And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous 
public buildings were constructed. The writers of the time were nearly 
unanimous in praising his rule. Did the writers have any other choice? Augustus exiled plenty of people 
on vague charges, including Ovid, 
one of Rome’s greatest poets. And you forgot to mention the intrusive 
laws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage 
between social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried. He was trying to improve the citizenry
and instill discipline. And he succeeded. His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded 
Rome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered 
as a model of civic virtue. His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless 
conquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy. Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform
commits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf 
of "the people," we have Augustus Caesar to thank. So you’re saying Augustus 
was a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing? We’re used to celebrating 
historical leaders for their achievements and victories. But to ask whether an individual should 
have such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial.

**Transcript**:
There’s a pretty awesome scene in The Fate
of the Furious where Jason Statham fights a bunch of armed
mercenaries on an airplane while holding an adorable baby in a carrier. I've always wondered how babies end up in
situations like this. What kind of hoops do you have to jump through
to cast babies in Hollywood? You were gonna shoot a baby? You sick bastard. Besides babysitting, delivering newspapers,
and, uh, wreath making, show business is the only industry that can
legally employ children under the age of 14 In fact, they’ve been in movies almost since
the birth of cinema. I hate myself so much. Casting a baby isn’t as simple as casting
a grown up actor though, For one: they don’t have to get their shift
at Starbucks covered to go to an audition, but mostly because there are some special
rules producers have to follow when casting an infant. For example, in California, babies can only
be on set for two consecutive hours per day, with actual work not exceeding 20 minutes
“under any circumstances.” The state’s child labor laws also require
that babies be at least 15 days old to be eligible for
a work permit. Which is good news for babies who can
just chill during their literal first days on earth, but not so good for productions that have
scenes with newborns because the thing is, if you’ve ever seen
a baby that’s two weeks old, you know that they don’t exactly look like
a newborn anymore. In order to get past this hurdle, productions
often try to cast preemies, who look newborn even when they’re the required
minimum of 15 days old, and in a lot of places outside of California
that’s perfectly legal. In 16 states there are actually zero regulations
regarding minimum age for baby employment in films and many other states have laws that are pretty
lax. In New Jersey for example a month-old baby
can work five hours a day, five days a week and in Louisiana they can be employed six
hours a day, six days a week. That’s more hours than I worked when I
bagged groceries after I graduated college and no I DO NOT want to talk about it. Most states also do nothing to protect the
money that babies make. Only a few places follow the Coogan Law, which requires that child actors be set up
with a blocked trust account to protect their earnings. The law is named after Jackie Coogan, an early 20th century child actor who was
in a number of Charlie Chaplin films including the American classic The Kid. As a child actor he reportedly earned as much
as $4 million, but his parents squandered all his money
by the time he became an adult. Because of his s***ty parents, moms and dads
in these states are required to set aside 15 persent of their
minor’s income in a Coogan account, which the child can access at the age of 18. Shooting with babies can be complicated,
but the film industry has a way of working around it. I would say 90 to 95 percent of jobs for babies
and toddlers are exclusive to twins and triplets because two babies can play one character. So there's two advantages there. Number one you can have them both come to
set at the same time. So if Twin A gets fussy they can call in Twin
B and they can use the babies back and forth. And the other thing is sometimes production
will split their call times so they'll have one baby come in let's say
at 9:00 in the morning have another baby come in at 2:00 in the afternoon. And so it extends their day. Also half of all twins and almost all triplets
are born premature, so productions get more working hours and
they look newborn. Sean Penn had a different solution. He directed a movie that nobody saw called
The Last Face where they put out a casting call for a one
day old baby. Since they were shooting in South Africa,
where you can cast minors with the permission of the Department of Labour, it was totally legal. Babies in show biz probably rake in big bucks
right? Unfortunately… not. Babies obviously can’t talk, so they are usually classified as an “under
5”, a term that refers to an actor with less than
five lines. It's interesting because you can have a baby
who is a recurring character on a TV show and has a name that the public can relate
to. But a lot of those babies are only getting
paid between 200 and 300 dollars a day. So babies don’t really make a ton of money. And casting them sounds like kind of a nightmare
-- are there any other options? Cut to American Sniper: Not all of them are as fake as this one, but plenty of productions resort to using
fake babies, at least for part of the shoot. Hey! Tend to my daughter please, right now! It is quite common that you know they’ll
use fake babies for the far away scenes and then you know they'll
hire a baby when they need a close up shot or a
face shot. And there are robot babies out there that
look pretty convincing. And by convincing I mean terrifying. I never thought I’d use a Mandy Moore clip
in one of my videos but here we go: They have this one robotic baby. It’s weird guys. I have two very emotional scenes where I’m
talking to a newborn in the hospital and I go to put my hand on the robotic baby and it’s like vibrating and like making
these weird movements. Babies on screen aren’t going away anytime
soon. So until producers find a cheap and easy CGI
fix for the baby dilemma, it looks like they’ll continue to have to
work within the regulations that are set up. Or they'll use demonic robot infants who will
take over humanity.

[UPBEAT MUSIC]  I know. I am doing a life hacks video. I know they're ridiculous,
but I swear to you, I've been using these
tricks in my life. And I really actually want
to share them with you. And I swear I will
not teach you things like you can cook a hot
dog by hooking it up to either side of
a 9 volt battery. I just used this trick
at a farmer's market. There was a company
selling sunglasses claiming that they were
certified polarized. To check whether sunglasses
are actually polarized, put them in front of the phone
screen and turn the glasses. If they're polarized,
you're going to see a change in the
light, either the color or the brightness. The light from
most phone screens is polarized, meaning the
light waves are aligned along a specific direction. Polarized sunglasses
let through light that is polarized in one direction. It's the same thing that
these polarizing filters do, but most people don't
keep polarizing filters in their purse. I do. So caveat to this trick. Screen protectors tend to make
the light from your phone more randomly polarized. So this trick may
work differently if you have a screen protector. But you can still
look at a reflection from glass or water
or a car window, because on some surfaces
at the right angle, you'll see changes
in the reflection as you turn the
polarized glasses. Oh yeah, so at the
farmer's market, the glasses were not polarized. And I told them so,
because in real life, I am like you guys
are in my comments. They started explaining to
me what polarization was and how it works. And eventually were removing
glasses from their shelves. Whoops! When you're putting
away your headphones, instead of wrapping them
in a loop, make a figure eight around your fingers. After a day of carrying
around your stuff, they're going to end
up much less tangled. This is the one I
was so excited about, because I've been
doing it for weeks and I can't believe
how it works. But it does. Why? Because your headphones
are like a flat ribbon. By wrapping them
in a circle, you introduce a bunch of twists. So when you straighten
them, the twists stay there. That doesn't happen
with a figure eight. Physicists have actually studied
why headphones get so tangled and it has to do with the
ends poking through the loops. That makes knots
and then you end up with twisted tangles
in your knots. So an added bonus
of the figure eight is that though you get knots,
your knots aren't all twisted. And you're making smaller loops. Harder for the ends to find. Boom! When you first get
in a hot car, you might want to just blast the AC. But you're still keeping
the hot air inside. So open those windows. And you may not have
checked this setting. Recycling the hot
air is just fighting against thermodynamics. So take in the cooler
air from outside first. Then, once it cools
down inside, recycle. The air gets hot inside a parked
car in the first place because of the greenhouse effect. High energy light
comes in the windows, gets absorbed by
your seats and stuff, and then some low energy
light is re-emitted but can't get back out the windows. So the inside gets hot. So let out the hot air first. To avoid getting
shocked by your car while getting out of
it on a cold, dry day, touch the outside of the
door frame as you get out. That allows the
static charge caused by sliding across the seat
to flow into the metal frame through your hand. So it never has a chance
to build up and shock you. It even works if
you're riding shotgun. Sorry. That one was a stretch. To remove the residue from an
old sticker, put some oil on it and rub it off. Or WD-40. I had no idea why this works. It's chemistry. So here to help me
explain is Elaine from the channel Reactions. ELAINE: So why does oil
remove sticker residue? Well, it all comes
down to the principle that like dissolves like. Water and things that
dissolve in water-- like sugar and salt-- are polar. Oil and water don't
mix, because oil is non-polar and water's polar. Adhesives that don't resolve
with water are non-polar. So putting the non-polar oil
with the non-polar adhesive mixes the two likes
together and allows you to easily wipe it away. Acetone, or nail polish
remover, can also works, since it's non-polar, too. However, nail polish remover
tends to dry out your skin. But that's a whole other story
for a completely different day.  Thank you, Elaine. That was awesome. I didn't know that's
why that trick worked. Check out Reactions. I'm going to put a link
in the description. We made it to the end

**Transcript**:
To boldly go where no man has gone before
is no small feat, given that since the development of space travel, only three countries have
launched a human into space. The first was Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagari,
who orbited the Earth in the Vostok 1 spacecraft on April 12, 1961. Only weeks later, the US launched their first
human into space, Alan Shepard, aboard the Freedom 7. It wouldn’t be until 2003 that China would
launch its first man into space, when the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft successfully took astronaut
Yang Liwei on a 21-hour mission to space and back. With revitalized space programs and private
sector space aspirations, developments over the next few years might just make space great
again. Today we’ll compare a veteran space program
with a relatively new kid on the block, in this episode of The Infographics Show, NASA
vs. SpaceX. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with a brief history of each
program. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, was created in 1958 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics
and Space Act. According to the act, NASA’s space exploration
would forever be “devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” It wasn’t until July 20, 1969, that NASA
would iconize space travel when it launched the Apollo 11 into space and made the first
successful moon landing. SpaceX, created by multitalented tech entrepreneur
Elon Musk, was founded on May 6, 2002. Musk’s mission is to eventually colonize
Mars, having stated on numerous occasions that human extinction on planet Earth is inevitable. SpaceX is, of course, a ways away from achieving
this goal, and while it hasn’t yet launched flesh and blood into space, it intends to
do so in the second quarter of next year. Musk has also said that by 2024, SpaceX will
have completed a manned mission to Mars. Moreover, he has boldly proclaimed that in
50 years’ time, his company’s Interplanetary Transport System will be delivering up to
a million people to the Mars Colony. Musk may seem overly ambitious compared to
NASA, whose website states that it won’t be until the 2030s until its sending people
to the Red Planet. Does this mean NASA and SpaceX are competitors? In some ways yes, as NASA is a government
agency and SpaceX is a private entity. The media has referred to this competition
as the first public-private space race. The phrase was dubbed, however, not because
of Mars ambitions, but after SpaceX announced in 2017 it will be taking people around the
moon in 2018. The main difference being that they would
not only be trained astronauts but extremely wealthy space tourists. NASA had before this announcement made it
known that it too would take tourists around the moon, but not until 2019. The question we now must ask is, who has the
most funding and who owns the more advanced technology to make space tourism happen? In terms of the balance sheet, SpaceX raised
over $1 billion in funding in 2015 with 11 investors taking part. Elon Musk himself is worth over 17 billion
dollars. The tech maverick has his hand in many pots,
including his venture into the self-driving car market with his Tesla Motors company. How does SpaceX actually make money while
piling it into developments and the millions it costs to launch? The answer is sending commercial satellites
into space, with investor analysis media Motley Fool claiming SpaceX charges around $62 million
per launch. SpaceX charges the government around $20 million
dollars every time it sends supplies to the International Space Station or launches satellites
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As of June 2017, SpaceX had launched rockets
into space 41 times, with this year looking to be a record for the number of space flights. According to SpaceX president, Gwynne Shotwell,
the company will launch every two to three weeks in 2017. According to Motley Fool, the total revenue
for SpaceX is around $1.3 billion with $195 million in annual profits. Over the years, NASA has suffered from underfunding,
which is one of the reasons why progress regarding the exploration of space has been ponderous
since the moon landing. In 2016, President Barack Obama bolstered
NASA’s ambitions with an increased budget of around half a billion dollars, bringing
the total budget to around 19 billion dollars. This was good news for NASA, spurring its
administrator, Charlie Bolden, to announce publicly, “NASA is firmly on a journey to
Mars. Make no mistake, this journey will help guide
and define our generation." We should note here that while there may be
a race to space between the private and the public in SpaceX and NASA, the former and
other public companies are working with NASA to make the Mars dream come true. NASA has had plenty of setbacks besides underfunding. This includes the loss of two of its space
shuttles in 1986 and 2003. Fourteen astronauts were killed in total,
which didn’t help NASA’s ambitions. NASA has launched well over 100 crewed missions
to space and over one thousand unmanned missions. NASA’s last manned space shuttle launch
was with its Space Transportation System in 2011. If you are wondering how astronauts or cosmonauts
these days get to the International Space Station and back down to Earth, they travel
on the Soyuz Russian spacecraft. Currently NASA is not sending humans into
space, although running the space station and most space-related activities are a collaboration
between NASA, Russia, and other countries. NASA had originally said it would again be
sending humans into space in 2021 aboard the Orion spacecraft, but that date has reportedly
been moved forward to 2019. Perhaps NASA’s greatest recent success was
the 2011 launch of its planetary rover and the current work it does on Mars. Named the Curiosity, the rover is five times
larger than previous rovers that were sent to explore the Red Planet. You might also be asking yourself, what is
the difference between an astronaut and a cosmonaut? The answer is not much; astronauts are trained
and certified through NASA and other countries’ space programs, while cosmonauts are trained
solely through Russia’s space program. Let’s now take a look at recent developments
and an inventory of rocket stock. SpaceX’s grandest creation so far is its
Falcon Heavy large payload rocket which is scheduled to launch within the next month
or two. The rocket is designed to carry people, and
it’s with this rocket that SpaceX sees the future. SpaceX also has a free-flying spacecraft called
Dragon, which was the first commercial spacecraft ever launched by a private company. It currently only carries cargo, but SpaceX
believes it will be ready for human space travel by as early as 2018. The Dragon can be carried on the Falcon heavy
rocket, or on SpaceX’s other rocket, the Falcon 9. The history of NASA’s space missions is
a long and fascinating story, and it is the reason for much of our understanding of space. For instance, NASA’s space probe, Voyager,
reached the outer planets of Jupiter and Saturn, and 39 years later it’s still out there
navigating interstellar space. Voyager 2 was launched soon after and was
the first spacecraft to rub shoulders with Uranus and Neptune. NASA currently has a space probe, Juno, orbiting
Jupiter, while another record was broken in 2015 when NASA’s New Horizons space probe
did a fly-by of the Pluto system. Travelling at over 36,000 miles per hour,
it made history when it came within 6,000 miles of Pluto. The journey was an astounding 3 billion miles. NASA’s current biggest development is the
Orion launch, which will take four astronauts beyond the moon, according to NASA. Other main developments are related to research
aboard the International Space Station, global aviation, and emerging technologies such as
robotics. NASA has achieved truly incredible things,
but will the organization have to move over for Elon Musk’s amazing spacecraft technologies? In 2017, rumors surfaced that Donald Trump’s
administration wants to return to the moon, but will it be with a NASA or SpaceX vehicle? Some critics believe America is big enough
for two space programs, public and private, and there’s enough room on the moon for
two future landings. Others have suggested NASA should keep its
focus on exploring deep space, while manned space travel and the possibility of a human
colony on Mars should be handled by other agencies. How do you think these two programs should
move into the future? Should NASA and SpaceX share the same space,
or should each know its own place? Let us know in the comments! And if you liked this video, be sure to check

**Transcript**:
To boldly go where no man has gone before
is no small feat, given that since the development of space travel, only three countries have
launched a human into space. The first was Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagari,
who orbited the Earth in the Vostok 1 spacecraft on April 12, 1961. Only weeks later, the US launched their first
human into space, Alan Shepard, aboard the Freedom 7. It wouldn’t be until 2003 that China would
launch its first man into space, when the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft successfully took astronaut
Yang Liwei on a 21-hour mission to space and back. With revitalized space programs and private
sector space aspirations, developments over the next few years might just make space great
again. Today we’ll compare a veteran space program
with a relatively new kid on the block, in this episode of The Infographics Show, NASA
vs. SpaceX. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the
bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with a brief history of each
program. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, was created in 1958 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics
and Space Act. According to the act, NASA’s space exploration
would forever be “devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” It wasn’t until July 20, 1969, that NASA
would iconize space travel when it launched the Apollo 11 into space and made the first
successful moon landing. SpaceX, created by multitalented tech entrepreneur
Elon Musk, was founded on May 6, 2002. Musk’s mission is to eventually colonize
Mars, having stated on numerous occasions that human extinction on planet Earth is inevitable. SpaceX is, of course, a ways away from achieving
this goal, and while it hasn’t yet launched flesh and blood into space, it intends to
do so in the second quarter of next year. Musk has also said that by 2024, SpaceX will
have completed a manned mission to Mars. Moreover, he has boldly proclaimed that in
50 years’ time, his company’s Interplanetary Transport System will be delivering up to
a million people to the Mars Colony. Musk may seem overly ambitious compared to
NASA, whose website states that it won’t be until the 2030s until its sending people
to the Red Planet. Does this mean NASA and SpaceX are competitors? In some ways yes, as NASA is a government
agency and SpaceX is a private entity. The media has referred to this competition
as the first public-private space race. The phrase was dubbed, however, not because
of Mars ambitions, but after SpaceX announced in 2017 it will be taking people around the
moon in 2018. The main difference being that they would
not only be trained astronauts but extremely wealthy space tourists. NASA had before this announcement made it
known that it too would take tourists around the moon, but not until 2019. The question we now must ask is, who has the
most funding and who owns the more advanced technology to make space tourism happen? In terms of the balance sheet, SpaceX raised
over $1 billion in funding in 2015 with 11 investors taking part. Elon Musk himself is worth over 17 billion
dollars. The tech maverick has his hand in many pots,
including his venture into the self-driving car market with his Tesla Motors company. How does SpaceX actually make money while

**Transcript**:
The sun is around 4.5 billion years old, and
just like you and I, it's aging. In just over a billion years, the sun will
have expanded so much that the heat will begin to melt the earth's surface. So, is there any way us Earthlings can avoid
this detrimental event? Can we save ourselves from the suns ultimate
death? Sure, none of us will be here, assuming we
don't find the secret to everlasting life. But, at the billion year mark, the sun will
have used up the hydrogen fuel in its core, forcing it to burn at its surface. The increased radiation will boil away all
of the water on Earth creating an international desert. Flash forward about 5 billion years, and the
swelling sun will begin literally melting mountains, with most, if not all life on earth
now extinct. Around 7.5 billion years, the expanding sun
- now a Red Giant - will engulf the Earth entirely. Sounds bleak -- so can we avoid this hot mess? It turns out; our best bet lies in something
called "Gravity Assist". A technique we've been using for years, only
to launch space crafts throughout our solar system. Anytime a spacecraft or satellite comes in
close proximity to a planet, gravity grabs hold. And if the spacecraft arrives at the perfect
angle, it's able to use some of the planets velocity to catapult it further into space. This 'extra' energy comes from the planet's
own energy of motion around the sun. But, as Newton famously said "To every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction". As the spacecraft uses the Earths gravity
to speed up and move towards Earth, the planet will ever so slightly slow down and move towards
the spacecraft. Of course, the spacecraft's mass is so small,
comparatively, that it gets launched incredibly far, while the planet experiences little change. But, if we were to increase the spacecraft's
size -- or use an asteroid -- we could potentially move the Earth's orbit away from the sun. This would take millions of years, and involve
large objects coming just close enough to not collide with Earth, but hey, we've got
a billion year head start! It may seem far-fetched, but it's already
happening! On October 9th, 2013, Earth will be used to
gravity assist a spacecraft called Juno, which is on its way to Jupiter. As Juno flies within 559 kilometers of us,
it will use Earth's gravity as a slingshot to boost its velocity by 7.3 km/s; Meanwhile,
Earth will have been moved by a fraction. Juno will later arrive at Jupiter, in 2016,
where it will study the interior of the planet and help to unveil many new spectacular mysteries
of our Solar System. In order to move the Earth within our billion
year timeline, we would need approximately 1 encounter every 6,000 years, using an object
with a mass of approximately 10^19kg. That's 19 zeros - somewhere around the size
of a 100 km-wide asteroid. In between passes, the asteroid would slingshot
around the sun, fly out to Jupiter, and then be gravity assisted back to Earth - like one
long version of catch between planets. Over millions of years, this would move Earth
to a comfortable 225 million kilometer orbit out from the sun. And while it is feasible, even with today's
technology, it doesn't come without risks. For one, we may lose the moon, which could
ultimately create some extreme weather patterns. Not to mention, the Earth's spin may increase,
making days only hours long. The surrounding planets, like our new neighbor
Mars, would likely have their own orbits destabilized. And...you know...the asteroid could come plummeting
into Earth by accident. But, perhaps these are the risks we need to
take to give our descendants, the planet and all life on it a few extra billion years. Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and

**Transcript**:
One fine day, when Charles Darwin was still 
a student at Cambridge, the budding naturalist tore some
old bark off a tree and found two rare beetles underneath. He’d just taken one beetle in each hand
when he spotted a third beetle. Stashing one of the insects 
in his mouth for safekeeping, he reached for the new specimen – when a sudden spray of hot, 
bitter fluid scalded his tongue. Darwin’s assailant 
was the bombardier beetle. It’s one of thousands of animal species, like frogs, jellyfish, salamanders, and snakes, that use toxic chemicals 
to defend themselves – in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid 
from glands in its abdomen. But why doesn’t this caustic substance,
ejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself? In fact, how do any toxic animals 
survive their own secretions? The answer is that they use one 
of two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them. Bombardier beetles use the first approach. They store ingredients for their poison 
in two separate chambers. When they’re threatened, the valve 
between the chambers opens and the substances combine 
in a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that
protects the beetle’s internal tissues. Similarly, jellyfish package 
their venom safely in harpoon-like structures 
called nematocysts. And venomous snakes store their
flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments
that only have one exit: through the fangs 
and into their prey or predator. Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance. Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers
manufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom 
components in the blood. Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also
evolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism. These tiny animals defend themselves 
using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants. One of their most potent alkaloids 
is the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors 
in the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger. An amount barely heavier than 
a grain of sugar would kill you. So what prevents poison frogs 
from poisoning themselves? Think of the molecular target 
of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key. When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical 
and electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death. But if you change the shape of the lock,
the key can’t fit. For poison dart frogs and many other
animals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter
the structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin 
from exerting its adverse effects. Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance: their predators and prey can, too. The garter snake, which dines 
on neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance 
to salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes 
as the salamanders themselves. That means that only the most toxic 
salamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes
will survive the meal. The result is that the genes providing 
the highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations. As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race 
that plays out over millions of years. This pattern appears over and over again. Grasshopper mice resist painful 
venom from scorpion prey through genetic changes 
in their nervous systems. Horned lizards readily 
consume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting 
with specialized blood plasma. And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation 
with compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses. The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray 
that Darwin found so distasteful. Most of the beetles 
are spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well. But how do the toads 
survive the experience? That is still a mystery.

**Transcript**:
One fine day, when Charles Darwin was still 
a student at Cambridge, the budding naturalist tore some
old bark off a tree and found two rare beetles underneath. He’d just taken one beetle in each hand
when he spotted a third beetle. Stashing one of the insects 
in his mouth for safekeeping, he reached for the new specimen – when a sudden spray of hot, 
bitter fluid scalded his tongue. Darwin’s assailant 
was the bombardier beetle. It’s one of thousands of animal species, like frogs, jellyfish, salamanders, and snakes, that use toxic chemicals 
to defend themselves – in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid 
from glands in its abdomen. But why doesn’t this caustic substance,
ejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself? In fact, how do any toxic animals 
survive their own secretions? The answer is that they use one 
of two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them. Bombardier beetles use the first approach. They store ingredients for their poison 
in two separate chambers. When they’re threatened, the valve 
between the chambers opens and the substances combine 
in a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that
protects the beetle’s internal tissues. Similarly, jellyfish package 
their venom safely in harpoon-like structures 
called nematocysts. And venomous snakes store their
flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments
that only have one exit: through the fangs 
and into their prey or predator. Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance. Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers
manufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom 
components in the blood. Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also
evolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism. These tiny animals defend themselves 
using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants. One of their most potent alkaloids 
is the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors 
in the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger. An amount barely heavier than 
a grain of sugar would kill you. So what prevents poison frogs 
from poisoning themselves? Think of the molecular target 
of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key. When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical 
and electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death. But if you change the shape of the lock,
the key can’t fit. For poison dart frogs and many other
animals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter
the structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin 
from exerting its adverse effects. Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance: their predators and prey can, too. The garter snake, which dines 
on neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance 
to salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes 
as the salamanders themselves. That means that only the most toxic 
salamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes
will survive the meal. The result is that the genes providing 
the highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations. As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race 
that plays out over millions of years. This pattern appears over and over again. Grasshopper mice resist painful 
venom from scorpion prey through genetic changes 
in their nervous systems. Horned lizards readily 
consume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting 
with specialized blood plasma. And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation 
with compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses. The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray 
that Darwin found so distasteful. Most of the beetles 
are spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well. But how do the toads 
survive the experience? That is still a mystery.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try 
and post your results in the comments.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try 
and post your results in the comments.

of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values 
are left out because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores. So how would you divide a 4x4, 10x10, or 32x32 canvas? Give it a try

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge. First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options. But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, 
we can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle. But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values. And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values

**Transcript**:
Cilantro is of the most common herbs in the
world, but unlike any other, this little leaf is infamous for it’s polarizing love-it-hate-it
reaction among foodies. It’s kind of like the Benedict Cumberbatch
of taco toppings. Today we’re taking a look at why such a
poor, innocent leaf can stoke such vitriol from the cilantro-phobes among us. This is Coriandrum sativum, an herb whose
leaves we’ve come to know as cilantro, and whose seeds are used as spice commonly called
coriander. Its love of warm weather lets it grow all
over the world, with the largest exporter being Mexico. So it’s no wonder you’re going to find
it in these. This little plant also comes from the same
family of aromatics as celery and parsley. But unlike parsley, which is probably one
of the most inoffensive plants out there, cilantro bares the burden of being one of
the most divisive herb known to humankind. Lots of people love its aromatic quality,
while others are totally repulsed by it. Every person has a different taste in food,
but this cilantroversy is so distinct in the population that it has led scientists to ask
whether there is an actual physical difference in cilantro haters. It’s been estimated that 4-14% of the population
can’t stand the taste of cilantro, but here’s where it gets interesting. Among that group of haters is a subgroup who
literally can’t help but hate it - they may have a genetic mutation that makes it
so. These folks describe the taste of cilantro
as soapy or dirt-like, terms that have a bit to do with the kind of smell you get from
raw fats, bugs, or cosmetics. And For the rest of us taco lovers, I know
this can seem like a huge disgrace, but I’m here to tell you today not to blame your cilantro
hating friend for their poor taste - these are matters that might rest far out their
hands of control. These haters may be coping with a small change
in their DNA called a single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP for short. Cilantro haters tend to have a different version
of a SNP in an area of chromosome 11 directly related to your sense of smell. This region contains the genes for several
odor detectors, and the culprit is thought to be OR6A2. The rodent version of this gene is known to
bind to a cilantro-abundant group of molecules called aldehydes, and common mutations in
the gene may change the way OR6A2 detects certain molecules in the aldehyde group, giving
people with these genetic changes an altogether different cilantro-sperience than the rest
of us. Aldehydes are cilantro’s primary odor-causing
compounds. Two compounds in this group, decanal and dodecanal
offer an earthy, sweet, green aroma. But the center of the cilantroversy is found
with the (E)-2-Alkenals, which give it that characteristically “soapy” taste. That SNP mutation mentioned earlier MAY cause
cilantro haters to experience these (E)-2-Alkenals differently than the rest of us, ultimately
making them the dominant flavor of the plant. But at this point, scientists haven’t discovered
the exact mechanism behind this soapy phenomenon. So when people out there say they hate cilantro,
now you know that it might not actually be their fault. They may be genetically programmed to taste
the stuff of soaps! What side of the cilantroversy are you on? Let us know in the comments. Have any other food related chemistry questions
you’re looking to have answer? Post them down there as well, and don’t

**Transcript**:
Cilantro is of the most common herbs in the
world, but unlike any other, this little leaf is infamous for it’s polarizing love-it-hate-it
reaction among foodies. It’s kind of like the Benedict Cumberbatch
of taco toppings. Today we’re taking a look at why such a
poor, innocent leaf can stoke such vitriol from the cilantro-phobes among us. This is Coriandrum sativum, an herb whose
leaves we’ve come to know as cilantro, and whose seeds are used as spice commonly called
coriander. Its love of warm weather lets it grow all
over the world, with the largest exporter being Mexico. So it’s no wonder you’re going to find
it in these. This little plant also comes from the same
family of aromatics as celery and parsley. But unlike parsley, which is probably one
of the most inoffensive plants out there, cilantro bares the burden of being one of
the most divisive herb known to humankind. Lots of people love its aromatic quality,
while others are totally repulsed by it. Every person has a different taste in food,
but this cilantroversy is so distinct in the population that it has led scientists to ask
whether there is an actual physical difference in cilantro haters. It’s been estimated that 4-14% of the population
can’t stand the taste of cilantro, but here’s where it gets interesting. Among that group of haters is a subgroup who
literally can’t help but hate it - they may have a genetic mutation that makes it
so. These folks describe the taste of cilantro
as soapy or dirt-like, terms that have a bit to do with the kind of smell you get from
raw fats, bugs, or cosmetics. And For the rest of us taco lovers, I know
this can seem like a huge disgrace, but I’m here to tell you today not to blame your cilantro
hating friend for their poor taste - these are matters that might rest far out their
hands of control. These haters may be coping with a small change
in their DNA called a single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP for short. Cilantro haters tend to have a different version
of a SNP in an area of chromosome 11 directly related to your sense of smell. This region contains the genes for several
odor detectors, and the culprit is thought to be OR6A2. The rodent version of this gene is known to
bind to a cilantro-abundant group of molecules called aldehydes, and common mutations in
the gene may change the way OR6A2 detects certain molecules in the aldehyde group, giving
people with these genetic changes an altogether different cilantro-sperience than the rest
of us. Aldehydes are cilantro’s primary odor-causing
compounds. Two compounds in this group, decanal and dodecanal
offer an earthy, sweet, green aroma. But the center of the cilantroversy is found
with the (E)-2-Alkenals, which give it that characteristically “soapy” taste. That SNP mutation mentioned earlier MAY cause
cilantro haters to experience these (E)-2-Alkenals differently than the rest of us, ultimately
making them the dominant flavor of the plant. But at this point, scientists haven’t discovered
the exact mechanism behind this soapy phenomenon. So when people out there say they hate cilantro,
now you know that it might not actually be their fault. They may be genetically programmed to taste
the stuff of soaps! What side of the cilantroversy are you on? Let us know in the comments. Have any other food related chemistry questions
you’re looking to have answer? Post them down there as well, and don’t

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] You know that horrible, sour smell that comes
from expired milk? Yeah. You only need to smell it once to make sure
it never happens again. Luckily, many food manufacturers put some
kind of Sell By, Best By, or Use By date on their products to tell you... well, actually, they don’t tell you much. These labels are mainly for quality and flavor
purposes, not safety. And a lot of common foods are edible past
what it says on the label. This can make it difficult to figure out what
you can eat and what needs to go in the compost bin. But understanding what’s happening chemically
when foods go bad, both before and after those dates pass, can help you out. A product’s real expiration date is tricky
to predict, because it can be affected by everything from the sanitation of the factory
to the temperature of your fridge. But a lot of it depends on what kind of food
you’re buying. Produce, for instance, can become unsafe anywhere
from hours to weeks after you buy it; a huge variation most labels don’t account for. Most of this has to do with when it gets moldy,
and not about things like brown spots. Although those don’t look pretty, they’re
harmless. Mold, meanwhile, can actually hurt you. Some strains produce substances called mycotoxins,
which can cause everything from skin infections to internal bleeding and death. And because produce is such a water- and nutrient-rich
home for mold, it can start growing as soon as 24 hours after you bring your produce home. And it grows even faster in warm temperatures,
like on your sunny kitchen countertop. Extending the shelf life of your produce is
pretty easy, though: Just throw it in the fridge. Chemical reactions happen more slowly at cold
temperatures, so it takes longer for mold to grow and reproduce in there. But it will grow eventually. And when it does, whether it’s after a day
or a few weeks, it’s time for the compost bin. Dropping the temperature might be a great
trick for a lot of food preservation, but if you want to really push back the expiration
date, you have to kill bacteria before letting them reproduce. That’s not easy with produce, but it’s
exactly how we treat milk. According to the label, milk is usually at
its best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how
you treat it, it could really expire a few days later, or earlier. Traditional milk goes through the process
of pasteurization, a heat treatment process that denatures enzymes in living bacteria
and renders them harmless. And it does a good job, but it’s not perfect. Some of those bacteria survive pasteurization,
and over time, they convert the sugars in milk into lactic acid. That’s what gives spoiled milk that sour
smell. Normally, this process takes a couple of weeks
and, typically, it’s still drinkable for around five days after the Sell-By date. But if the milk gets exposed to slightly warmer
temperatures somewhere along the shipping route, or if you run your refrigerator a few
degrees warmer, it can spoil faster. And while you’re probably not going to catch
anything life threatening from drinking spoiled milk, you can catch some brutal food poisoning. The good news is, it’s easy to tell if milk’s
gone bad. Just give it a whiff, and take in that lovely
lactic acid smell. Finally, while heat treatments are awesome
for getting rid of bacteria in milk, you’ll need a different strategy for meat. Typically, the Best or Use By dates on these
products is for a week or so past purchase. But while it’s often safe past then, it
doesn’t last for that much longer. That’s because meat is a prime breeding
ground for bacteria. It’s a wet, nutrient-dense home with all
kinds of fuel sources. For a few days, these bacteria won’t cause
you any trouble because there aren’t that many of them. But over time, they’ll multiply. And that’s when you get problems. Bacteria, like Psuedomonas or Lactobacilli,
feast on the meat’s surface, where there are free floating sugar molecules and light
weight compounds to nom on. Some of these bacteria can make you sick,
but they do at least announce their presence. As they break those compounds down, they leave
behind some nasty smelling byproducts. These have all kinds of shapes and compositions,
but they all fall into a category called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Normally, these VOCS smell like rotten meat. And because you find them when bacteria have
been chowing down and multiplying, there’s a pretty strong sign your meat has gone bad. Besides the smell, you can also probably tell
your meat has expired based on how it looks. For example, VOCs like hydrogen sulfide can
convert the natural muscle pigment in meat into something that looks more green. Typically, all this happens a few days after
the Use By date on that sticker. But if you notice any of those funky smells
or a little slime on your beef… it’s time for it to go, no matter when it happens. Food science can be tricky, and those ambiguous
labels don’t always help. Knowing a little bit about how and why food
expires can help you keep your fridge full for longer. But if you’re really uncertain… it’s
okay to play it safe. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! Scishow is a production of Complexly, which

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] You know that horrible, sour smell that comes
from expired milk? Yeah. You only need to smell it once to make sure
it never happens again. Luckily, many food manufacturers put some
kind of Sell By, Best By, or Use By date on their products to tell you... well, actually, they don’t tell you much. These labels are mainly for quality and flavor
purposes, not safety. And a lot of common foods are edible past
what it says on the label. This can make it difficult to figure out what
you can eat and what needs to go in the compost bin. But understanding what’s happening chemically
when foods go bad, both before and after those dates pass, can help you out. A product’s real expiration date is tricky
to predict, because it can be affected by everything from the sanitation of the factory
to the temperature of your fridge. But a lot of it depends on what kind of food
you’re buying. Produce, for instance, can become unsafe anywhere
from hours to weeks after you buy it; a huge variation most labels don’t account for. Most of this has to do with when it gets moldy,
and not about things like brown spots. Although those don’t look pretty, they’re
harmless. Mold, meanwhile, can actually hurt you. Some strains produce substances called mycotoxins,
which can cause everything from skin infections to internal bleeding and death. And because produce is such a water- and nutrient-rich
home for mold, it can start growing as soon as 24 hours after you bring your produce home. And it grows even faster in warm temperatures,
like on your sunny kitchen countertop. Extending the shelf life of your produce is
pretty easy, though: Just throw it in the fridge. Chemical reactions happen more slowly at cold
temperatures, so it takes longer for mold to grow and reproduce in there. But it will grow eventually. And when it does, whether it’s after a day
or a few weeks, it’s time for the compost bin. Dropping the temperature might be a great
trick for a lot of food preservation, but if you want to really push back the expiration
date, you have to kill bacteria before letting them reproduce. That’s not easy with produce, but it’s
exactly how we treat milk. According to the label, milk is usually at
its best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how
you treat it, it could really expire a few days later, or earlier. Traditional milk goes through the process
of pasteurization, a heat treatment process that denatures enzymes in living bacteria
and renders them harmless. And it does a good job, but it’s not perfect. Some of those bacteria survive pasteurization,
and over time, they convert the sugars in milk into lactic acid. That’s what gives spoiled milk that sour
smell. Normally, this process takes a couple of weeks
and, typically, it’s still drinkable for around five days after the Sell-By date. But if the milk gets exposed to slightly warmer
temperatures somewhere along the shipping route, or if you run your refrigerator a few
degrees warmer, it can spoil faster. And while you’re probably not going to catch
anything life threatening from drinking spoiled milk, you can catch some brutal food poisoning. The good news is, it’s easy to tell if milk’s
gone bad. Just give it a whiff, and take in that lovely
lactic acid smell. Finally, while heat treatments are awesome
for getting rid of bacteria in milk, you’ll need a different strategy for meat. Typically, the Best or Use By dates on these
products is for a week or so past purchase. But while it’s often safe past then, it
doesn’t last for that much longer. That’s because meat is a prime breeding
ground for bacteria. It’s a wet, nutrient-dense home with all
kinds of fuel sources. For a few days, these bacteria won’t cause
you any trouble because there aren’t that many of them. But over time, they’ll multiply. And that’s when you get problems. Bacteria, like Psuedomonas or Lactobacilli,
feast on the meat’s surface, where there are free floating sugar molecules and light
weight compounds to nom on. Some of these bacteria can make you sick,
but they do at least announce their presence. As they break those compounds down, they leave
behind some nasty smelling byproducts. These have all kinds of shapes and compositions,
but they all fall into a category called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Normally, these VOCS smell like rotten meat. And because you find them when bacteria have
been chowing down and multiplying, there’s a pretty strong sign your meat has gone bad. Besides the smell, you can also probably tell
your meat has expired based on how it looks. For example, VOCs like hydrogen sulfide can
convert the natural muscle pigment in meat into something that looks more green. Typically, all this happens a few days after
the Use By date on that sticker. But if you notice any of those funky smells
or a little slime on your beef… it’s time for it to go, no matter when it happens. Food science can be tricky, and those ambiguous
labels don’t always help. Knowing a little bit about how and why food
expires can help you keep your fridge full for longer. But if you’re really uncertain… it’s
okay to play it safe. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! Scishow is a production of Complexly, which

**Transcript**:
[♪ INTRO] You know that horrible, sour smell that comes
from expired milk? Yeah. You only need to smell it once to make sure
it never happens again. Luckily, many food manufacturers put some
kind of Sell By, Best By, or Use By date on their products to tell you... well, actually, they don’t tell you much. These labels are mainly for quality and flavor
purposes, not safety. And a lot of common foods are edible past
what it says on the label. This can make it difficult to figure out what
you can eat and what needs to go in the compost bin. But understanding what’s happening chemically
when foods go bad, both before and after those dates pass, can help you out. A product’s real expiration date is tricky
to predict, because it can be affected by everything from the sanitation of the factory
to the temperature of your fridge. But a lot of it depends on what kind of food
you’re buying. Produce, for instance, can become unsafe anywhere
from hours to weeks after you buy it; a huge variation most labels don’t account for. Most of this has to do with when it gets moldy,
and not about things like brown spots. Although those don’t look pretty, they’re
harmless. Mold, meanwhile, can actually hurt you. Some strains produce substances called mycotoxins,
which can cause everything from skin infections to internal bleeding and death. And because produce is such a water- and nutrient-rich
home for mold, it can start growing as soon as 24 hours after you bring your produce home. And it grows even faster in warm temperatures,
like on your sunny kitchen countertop. Extending the shelf life of your produce is
pretty easy, though: Just throw it in the fridge. Chemical reactions happen more slowly at cold
temperatures, so it takes longer for mold to grow and reproduce in there. But it will grow eventually. And when it does, whether it’s after a day
or a few weeks, it’s time for the compost bin. Dropping the temperature might be a great
trick for a lot of food preservation, but if you want to really push back the expiration
date, you have to kill bacteria before letting them reproduce. That’s not easy with produce, but it’s
exactly how we treat milk. According to the label, milk is usually at
its best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how
you treat it, it could really expire a few days later, or earlier. Traditional milk goes through the process
of pasteurization, a heat treatment process that denatures enzymes in living bacteria
and renders them harmless. And it does a good job, but it’s not perfect. Some of those bacteria survive pasteurization,
and over time, they convert the sugars in milk into lactic acid. That’s what gives spoiled milk that sour
smell. Normally, this process takes a couple of weeks
and, typically, it’s still drinkable for around five days after the Sell-By date. But if the milk gets exposed to slightly warmer
temperatures somewhere along the shipping route, or if you run your refrigerator a few
degrees warmer, it can spoil faster. And while you’re probably not going to catch
anything life threatening from drinking spoiled milk, you can catch some brutal food poisoning. The good news is, it’s easy to tell if milk’s
gone bad. Just give it a whiff, and take in that lovely
lactic acid smell. Finally, while heat treatments are awesome
for getting rid of bacteria in milk, you’ll need a different strategy for meat. Typically, the Best or Use By dates on these
products is for a week or so past purchase. But while it’s often safe past then, it
doesn’t last for that much longer. That’s because meat is a prime breeding
ground for bacteria. It’s a wet, nutrient-dense home with all
kinds of fuel sources. For a few days, these bacteria won’t cause
you any trouble because there aren’t that many of them. But over time, they’ll multiply. And that’s when you get problems. Bacteria, like Psuedomonas or Lactobacilli,
feast on the meat’s surface, where there are free floating sugar molecules and light
weight compounds to nom on. Some of these bacteria can make you sick,
but they do at least announce their presence. As they break those compounds down, they leave
behind some nasty smelling byproducts. These have all kinds of shapes and compositions,
but they all fall into a category called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Normally, these VOCS smell like rotten meat. And because you find them when bacteria have
been chowing down and multiplying, there’s a pretty strong sign your meat has gone bad. Besides the smell, you can also probably tell
your meat has expired based on how it looks. For example, VOCs like hydrogen sulfide can
convert the natural muscle pigment in meat into something that looks more green. Typically, all this happens a few days after
the Use By date on that sticker. But if you notice any of those funky smells
or a little slime on your beef… it’s time for it to go, no matter when it happens. Food science can be tricky, and those ambiguous
labels don’t always help. Knowing a little bit about how and why food
expires can help you keep your fridge full for longer. But if you’re really uncertain… it’s
okay to play it safe. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow! Scishow is a production of Complexly, which

**Transcript**:
An elderly woman named Rosalie 
was sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst 
to life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed,
not by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage 
was an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications 
that might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd 
of circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known 
as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired 
vision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes 
in vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years. We still don’t fully understand 
what causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them 
when others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies 
that these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated 
by imagination. Many other hallucinations, 
including smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas 
as real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter 
covers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing 
information from each of our senses. But even in people
with completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive
from incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve 
blocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with 
information from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,
but most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived 
of input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries 
to create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities 
become a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of
Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people who had normal vision 
and then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses
remembered images to compensate for 
the lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss 
often hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony 
of an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders 
like schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes 
of hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs 
like LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include 
the sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world 
can appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also 
act on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically 
only causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual
disturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate 
receptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions 
for all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations. But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct 
the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.

the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate

**Transcript**:
An elderly woman named Rosalie 
was sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst 
to life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed,
not by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage 
was an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications 
that might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd 
of circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known 
as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired 
vision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes 
in vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years. We still don’t fully understand 
what causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them 
when others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies 
that these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated 
by imagination. Many other hallucinations, 
including smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas 
as real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter 
covers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing 
information from each of our senses. But even in people
with completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive
from incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve 
blocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with 
information from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,
but most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived 
of input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries 
to create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities 
become a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of
Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people who had normal vision 
and then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses
remembered images to compensate for 
the lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss 
often hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony 
of an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders 
like schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes 
of hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs 
like LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include 
the sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world 
can appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also 
act on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically 
only causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual
disturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate 
receptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions 
for all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations. But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct 
the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.

**Transcript**:
Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call "eusocial" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor. In eusocial societies, the workers, soldiers, caretakers and reproducers are different not only in their behaviors but in their physiologies as well For instance, a worker bee can't reproduce at all. There can only be one reproducer: the queen bee, and her name is Beyonce. Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. "Wherever man is, there the ant is also." This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious. Stinging Ants Ants don't only live in dead trees. some living trees have made accommodations for them, too. Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call "eusocial" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor. In eusocial societies, the workers, soldiers, caretakers and reproducers are different not only in their behaviors but in their physiologies as well For instance, a worker bee can't reproduce at all. There can only be one reproducer: the queen bee, and her name is Beyonce. Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. "Wherever man is, there the ant is also." This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious. Stinging Ants Ants don't only live in dead trees. some living trees have made accommodations for them, too. Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it

**Transcript**:
Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call "eusocial" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor. In eusocial societies, the workers, soldiers, caretakers and reproducers are different not only in their behaviors but in their physiologies as well For instance, a worker bee can't reproduce at all. There can only be one reproducer: the queen bee, and her name is Beyonce. Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. "Wherever man is, there the ant is also." This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious. Stinging Ants Ants don't only live in dead trees. some living trees have made accommodations for them, too. Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it

**Transcript**:
You hear the gentle lap of waves, the distant cawing of a seagull. But then an annoying whine
interrupts the peace, getting closer, and closer, and closer. Until...whack! You dispatch the offending mosquito, 
and calm is restored. How did you detect that noise from afar
and target its maker with such precision? The ability to recognize sounds 
and identify their location is possible thanks to the auditory system. That’s comprised of two main parts: 
the ear and the brain. The ear’s task is to convert sound energy
into neural signals; the brain’s is to receive and process 
the information those signals contain. To understand how that works, we can follow a sound 
on its journey into the ear. The source of a sound creates vibrations that travel as waves of pressure 
through particles in air, liquids, or solids. But our inner ear, called the cochlea, is actually filled 
with saltwater-like fluids. So, the first problem to solve 
is how to convert those sound waves, wherever they’re coming from, into waves in the fluid. The solution is the eardrum, 
or tympanic membrane, and the tiny bones of the middle ear. Those convert the large movements 
of the eardrum into pressure waves 
in the fluid of the cochlea. When sound enters the ear canal, it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate 
like the head of a drum. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone 
called the hammer, which hits the anvil and
moves the third bone called the stapes. Its motion pushes the fluid 
within the long chambers of the cochlea. Once there, the sound vibrations have finally
been converted into vibrations of a fluid, and they travel like a wave 
from one end of the cochlea to the other. A surface called the basilar membrane 
runs the length of the cochlea. It’s lined with hair cells that have 
specialized components called stereocilia, which move with the vibrations of the
cochlear fluid and the basilar membrane. This movement triggers a signal 
that travels through the hair cell, into the auditory nerve, then onward to the brain, 
which interprets it as a specific sound. When a sound makes 
the basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves - only selected ones, 
depending on the frequency of the sound. This comes down to some fine engineering. At one end, 
the basilar membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short
wavelength, high-frequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrating only in the presence of longer
wavelength, low-frequency sounds. So, the noises made by the seagull 
and mosquito vibrate different locations 
on the basilar membrane, like playing different keys on a piano. But that’s not all that’s going on. The brain still has another 
important task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from. For that, it compares the sounds 
coming into the two ears to locate the source in space. A sound from directly in front of you will
reach both your ears at the same time. You’ll also hear it at the same intensity 
in each ear. However, a low-frequency sound 
coming from one side will reach the near ear microseconds 
before the far one. And high-frequency sounds will sound
more intense to the near ear because they’re blocked 
from the far ear by your head. These strands of information 
reach special parts of the brainstem that analyze time and
intensity differences between your ears. They send the results of their 
analysis up to the auditory cortex. Now, the brain has 
all the information it needs: the patterns of activity 
that tell us what the sound is, and information about 
where it is in space. Not everyone has normal hearing. Hearing loss is the third most common 
chronic disease in the world. Exposure to loud noises 
and some drugs can kill hair cells, preventing signals from traveling 
from the ear to the brain. Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze 
the tiny bones in the ear so they no longer vibrate. And with tinnitus, the brain does strange things to make us think there’s a sound 
when there isn’t one. But when it does work, our hearing is an incredible, 
elegant system. Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece 
of biological machinery that converts the cacophony of vibrations 
in the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulses that distinguish claps, taps, 
sighs, and flies.

into neural signals; the brain’s is to receive and process 
the information those signals contain. To understand how that works, we can follow a sound 
on its journey into the ear. The source of a sound creates vibrations that travel as waves of pressure 
through particles in air, liquids, or solids. But our inner ear, called the cochlea, is actually filled 
with saltwater-like fluids. So, the first problem to solve 
is how to convert those sound waves, wherever they’re coming from, into waves in the fluid. The solution is the eardrum, 
or tympanic membrane, and the tiny bones of the middle ear. Those convert the large movements 
of the eardrum into pressure waves 
in the fluid of the cochlea. When sound enters the ear canal, it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate 
like the head of a drum. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone 
called the hammer, which hits the anvil and
moves the third bone called the stapes. Its motion pushes the fluid 
within the long chambers of the cochlea. Once there, the sound vibrations have finally
been converted into vibrations of a fluid, and they travel like a wave 
from one end of the cochlea to the other. A surface called the basilar membrane 
runs the length of the cochlea. It’s lined with hair cells that have 
specialized components called stereocilia, which move with the vibrations of the
cochlear fluid and the basilar membrane. This movement triggers a signal 
that travels through the hair cell, into the auditory nerve, then onward to the brain, 
which interprets it as a specific sound. When a sound makes 
the basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves - only selected ones, 
depending on the frequency of the sound. This comes down to some fine engineering. At one end, 
the basilar membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short
wavelength, high-frequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrating only in the presence of longer
wavelength, low-frequency sounds. So, the noises made by the seagull 
and mosquito vibrate different locations 
on the basilar membrane, like playing different keys on a piano. But that’s not all that’s going on. The brain still has another 
important task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from. For that, it compares the sounds 
coming into the two ears to locate the source in space. A sound from directly in front of you will
reach both your ears at the same time. You’ll also hear it at the same intensity 
in each ear. However, a low-frequency sound 
coming from one side will reach the near ear microseconds 
before the far one. And high-frequency sounds will sound
more intense to the near ear because they’re blocked 
from the far ear by your head. These strands of information 
reach special parts of the brainstem that analyze time and
intensity differences between your ears. They send the results of their 
analysis up to the auditory cortex. Now, the brain has 
all the information it needs: the patterns of activity 
that tell us what the sound is, and information about 
where it is in space. Not everyone has normal hearing. Hearing loss is the third most common 
chronic disease in the world. Exposure to loud noises 
and some drugs can kill hair cells, preventing signals from traveling 
from the ear to the brain. Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze 
the tiny bones in the ear so they no longer vibrate. And with tinnitus, the brain does strange things to make us think there’s a sound 
when there isn’t one. But when it does work, our hearing is an incredible, 
elegant system. Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece 
of biological machinery that converts the cacophony of vibrations 
in the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulses that distinguish claps, taps, 
sighs, and flies.

**Transcript**:
Since the time of Homer, ancient stories told of fierce warriors 
dwelling beyond the Mediterranean world, striking fear into the mightiest 
empires of antiquity. Their exploits were
recounted by many epic poets. They fought in the legendary Trojan War 
and their grand army invaded Athens. Jason and the Argonauts 
passed by their shores, barely avoiding their deadly arrows. These formidable fighters faced off 
against the greatest champions of myth: Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles. And every single one 
of these warriors was a woman. The war-loving Amazons,
"the equals of men" in courage and skill, were familiar to everyone in
ancient Greece. Amazon battle scenes decorated 
the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis; paintings and statues of Amazons
adorned temples and public spaces. Little girls played with Amazon dolls, and Amazons were a favorite subject 
on Greek vase paintings. In Greek art and literature, they were depicted as daring 
and desirable, but also terrifying and deadly, and doomed to die 
at the hands of Greek heroes. Were Amazons merely figures of myth,
or something more? It was long assumed 
that they were imaginary, like the cyclops and centaurs. But curiously enough, 
stories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. And Amazons were described in ancient
historical accounts, not just myths. Writers like Herodotus, Plato, 
and Strabo never doubted their existence. So who were the real women 
warriors known as Amazons? Ancient historians located 
the Amazon homeland in Scythia, the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across 
the steppes of Central Asia. This immense region was populated 
by nomadic tribes whose lives centered on horses, archery, and warfare. Their culture flourished for about
1,000 years beginning around 800 BC. Feared by Greeks, Persians, and
the Chinese, the Scythians left no written records.
But we can find clues in how their neighbors described them,
as well as in archaeology. Scythians' ancestors were 
the first to ride horses and they invented the recurve bow. And, because a female mounted archer 
could be as fast and as deadly as a male, all children were trained 
to ride and shoot. Women hunted and fought alongside men,
using the same weapons. The harsh landscape 
and their nomadic lifestyle created its own form of equality. This amazed the ancient Greeks, 
whose women led restricted indoor lives. The earliest stories of the Scythians, 
and Amazons, may have been exaggerated rumors. But as the Greeks began to trade around 
the Black Sea and further east, their portrayals became more realistic. Early depictions of Amazons showed them 
with Greek weapons and armor. But in later representations, they wielded bows and battle-axes, rode horses, and wore pointed caps 
and patterned trousers characteristic of steppe nomads. Until recently, no one was sure 
how strong the links were between Scythians 
and the Amazons of Greek myth. But recent archaeological discoveries 
have provided ample evidence. More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,
or burial mounds, have been excavated, containing skeletons and weapons. Archaeologists had previously assumed that weapons could only 
belong to male warriors. But modern DNA analysis so far has revealed that about 300 skeletons 
buried with weapons belong to females ranging
in age from 10 to 45, and more are being found every year. The women's skeletons 
show battle injuries: ribs slashed by swords, skulls bashed by battle-axes, and arrows embedded in bones. In classical art and writings, the fearsome Amazons were always portrayed
as brave and heroic. In male-dominated classical Greece, 
however, the very idea of strong women who gloried 
in freedom and war aroused mixed feelings. And yet, the Greeks were also drawn
to egalitarian ideals. Is it possible that the mythic realm 
of thrilling Amazon tales was a way to imagine women
and men as equal companions?

**Transcript**:
Since the time of Homer, ancient stories told of fierce warriors 
dwelling beyond the Mediterranean world, striking fear into the mightiest 
empires of antiquity. Their exploits were
recounted by many epic poets. They fought in the legendary Trojan War 
and their grand army invaded Athens. Jason and the Argonauts 
passed by their shores, barely avoiding their deadly arrows. These formidable fighters faced off 
against the greatest champions of myth: Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles. And every single one 
of these warriors was a woman. The war-loving Amazons,
"the equals of men" in courage and skill, were familiar to everyone in
ancient Greece. Amazon battle scenes decorated 
the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis; paintings and statues of Amazons
adorned temples and public spaces. Little girls played with Amazon dolls, and Amazons were a favorite subject 
on Greek vase paintings. In Greek art and literature, they were depicted as daring 
and desirable, but also terrifying and deadly, and doomed to die 
at the hands of Greek heroes. Were Amazons merely figures of myth,
or something more? It was long assumed 
that they were imaginary, like the cyclops and centaurs. But curiously enough, 
stories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. And Amazons were described in ancient
historical accounts, not just myths. Writers like Herodotus, Plato, 
and Strabo never doubted their existence. So who were the real women 
warriors known as Amazons? Ancient historians located 
the Amazon homeland in Scythia, the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across 
the steppes of Central Asia. This immense region was populated 
by nomadic tribes whose lives centered on horses, archery, and warfare. Their culture flourished for about
1,000 years beginning around 800 BC. Feared by Greeks, Persians, and
the Chinese, the Scythians left no written records.
But we can find clues in how their neighbors described them,
as well as in archaeology. Scythians' ancestors were 
the first to ride horses and they invented the recurve bow. And, because a female mounted archer 
could be as fast and as deadly as a male, all children were trained 
to ride and shoot. Women hunted and fought alongside men,
using the same weapons. The harsh landscape 
and their nomadic lifestyle created its own form of equality. This amazed the ancient Greeks, 
whose women led restricted indoor lives. The earliest stories of the Scythians, 
and Amazons, may have been exaggerated rumors. But as the Greeks began to trade around 
the Black Sea and further east, their portrayals became more realistic. Early depictions of Amazons showed them 
with Greek weapons and armor. But in later representations, they wielded bows and battle-axes, rode horses, and wore pointed caps 
and patterned trousers characteristic of steppe nomads. Until recently, no one was sure 
how strong the links were between Scythians 
and the Amazons of Greek myth. But recent archaeological discoveries 
have provided ample evidence. More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,
or burial mounds, have been excavated, containing skeletons and weapons. Archaeologists had previously assumed that weapons could only

- Relevance Score: 0.6000 (The generated question is related to the same topic as the ground truth question, but it focuses on a specific detail - the age range of the female skeletons - rather than the broader confirmation of archaeological evidence.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer options do not match between the two questions.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.8000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible and could be considered reasonable options, but they are not as strong as they could be in terms of matching the context and intent of the ground truth question.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 1.0000 (Both questions are clear and easy to understand.)
- Total Score: 0.6000
