    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who proposed the theory of universal grammar in the early 1950s?\n    - A: B.F. Skinner\n    - B: Noam Chomsky\n    - C: Jean Piaget\n    - D: Lev Vygotsky\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What analytical tool did Chomsky develop to establish universal rules of grammar?\n    - A: Generative semantics\n    - B: Generative syntax\n    - C: Transformational grammar\n    - D: Structural linguistics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the theory of universal grammar, why can humans come up with an infinite number of sentences in their native language?\n    - A: Because language is learned through imitation and environment\n    - B: Because the human brain is hardwired to process language according to innate rules\n    - C: Because language is a product of culture and environment\n    - D: Because language is a finite system with a limited number of possible combinations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What are the two main components of universal grammar, according to the theory?\n    - A: The existence of universal grammar rules and the role of environment in language acquisition\n    - B: The existence of universal grammar rules and whether these rules are hardwired in the brain\n    - C: The existence of language variation and the importance of language instruction\n    - D: The existence of language universals and the role of culture in language acquisition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) (New question) What is the main challenge to Chomsky's theory of universal grammar posed by the discovery of the Piraha language?\n    - A: The language has a complex system of grammar rules\n    - B: The language lacks a system of grammar rules\n    - C: The language has a unique sound system\n    - D: The language does not appear to have recursive structures\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) (New question) How does the principles and parameters hypothesis attempt to accommodate language variation?\n    - A: By proposing that all languages share a set of universal grammar rules\n    - B: By suggesting that languages differ in their application of universal grammar rules\n    - C: By proposing that languages have a unique set of grammar rules\n    - D: By suggesting that language variation is due to environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between universal grammar and language acquisition, according to the theory?\n    - A: Innate rules have no influence on language learning\n    - B: Innate rules influence language learning, but only in a minor way\n    - C: Innate rules play a significant role in shaping language acquisition\n    - D: Language acquisition is solely the result of environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does the theory of universal grammar contrast with the behaviorist paradigm?\n    - A: The theory of universal grammar emphasizes the role of environment in language acquisition, while behaviorism emphasizes the role of innate rules\n    - B: The theory of universal grammar emphasizes the role of innate rules in language acquisition, while behaviorism emphasizes the role of environment\n    - C: The theory of universal grammar and behaviorism both emphasize the role of innate rules in language acquisition\n    - D: The theory of universal grammar and behaviorism both emphasize the role of environment in language acquisition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What might be the result of integrating the principles and parameters hypothesis with language acquisition theories?\n    - A: A more comprehensive model of language learning that takes into account both innate rules and environmental factors\n    - B: A more rigid set of rules for language instruction\n    - C: A greater emphasis on language variation and change\n    - D: A rejection of the theory of universal grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What might be the benefit of combining the concept of universal grammar with findings from cognitive science?\n    - A: A better understanding of the neural basis of language processing\n    - B: A more comprehensive model of language acquisition\n    - C: A greater emphasis on language instruction\n    - D: A rejection of the theory of universal grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is one potential limitation of Chomsky's theory of universal grammar?\n    - A: It fails to account for language variation and change\n    - B: It overemphasizes the role of environment in language acquisition\n    - C: It is too broad and fails to provide specific predictions\n    - D: The discovery of languages that do not appear to have universal grammar rules\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) Why might the study of universal grammar be important for understanding human language and cognition?\n    - A: Because it provides a set of rigid rules for language instruction\n    - B: Because it helps to explain the neural basis of language processing\n    - C: Because it informs the development of language acquisition theories and models\n    - D: Because it challenges the dominant paradigm of behaviorism and provides insight into the human brain\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n13) What is the name of the Amazonian language that challenges Chomsky's theory of universal grammar?\n    - A: Piraha\n    - B: Warao\n    - C: Yanomami\n    - D: Ticuna\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) What is the term for the ability to nest structures inside each other, proposed by Chomsky as a universal grammar rule?\n    - A: Recursion\n    - B: Embedding\n    - C: Nesting\n    - D: Hierarchy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n15) What is the name of the hypothesis proposed by Chomsky to accommodate language variation?\n    - A: Principles and parameters\n    - B: Universal grammar\n    - C: Generative syntax\n    - D: Transformational grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-4, 7-10, 12-15. Questions 5 and 6 were added to address specific points in the transcript. Questions 11 was refined to make the correct answer more specific."
