    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Who proposed the theory of universal grammar in the early 1950s?\n    - A: B.F. Skinner\n    - B: Noam Chomsky\n    - C: Jean Piaget\n    - D: Lev Vygotsky\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n2) What analytical tool did Chomsky develop to establish universal rules of grammar?\n    - A: Generative semantics\n    - B: Generative syntax\n    - C: Transformational grammar\n    - D: Structural linguistics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n3) According to the theory of universal grammar, why can humans come up with an infinite number of sentences in their native language?\n    - A: Because language is learned through imitation and environment\n    - B: Because the human brain is hardwired to process language according to innate rules\n    - C: Because language is a product of culture and environment\n    - D: Because language is a finite system with a limited number of possible combinations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n(Refined to make option A more plausible)\n\n4) What are the two main components of universal grammar, according to the theory?\n    - A: The existence of universal grammar rules and the role of environment in language acquisition\n    - B: The existence of universal grammar rules and whether these rules are hardwired in the brain\n    - C: The existence of language variation and the importance of language instruction\n    - D: The existence of language universals and the role of culture in language acquisition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n5) This question was removed as it was not directly related to the transcript.\n\n6) This question was removed as it was not directly related to the transcript.\n\n7) What is the relationship between universal grammar and language acquisition, according to the theory?\n    - A: Innate rules have no influence on language learning\n    - B: Innate rules influence language learning, but only in a minor way\n    - C: Innate rules play a significant role in shaping language acquisition\n    - D: Language acquisition is solely the result of environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n8) How does the theory of universal grammar contrast with the behaviorist paradigm?\n    - A: The theory of universal grammar emphasizes the role of environment in language acquisition, while behaviorism emphasizes the role of innate rules\n    - B: The theory of universal grammar emphasizes the role of innate rules in language acquisition, while behaviorism emphasizes the role of environment\n    - C: The theory of universal grammar and behaviorism both emphasize the role of innate rules in language acquisition\n    - D: The theory of universal grammar and behaviorism both emphasize the role of environment in language acquisition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n9) What might be the result of integrating the principles and parameters hypothesis with language acquisition theories?\n    - A: A more comprehensive model of language learning that takes into account both innate rules and environmental factors\n    - B: A more rigid set of rules for language instruction\n    - C: A greater emphasis on language variation and change\n    - D: A rejection of the theory of universal grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n10) What might be the benefit of combining the concept of universal grammar with findings from cognitive science?\n    - A: A better understanding of the neural basis of language processing\n    - B: A more comprehensive model of language acquisition\n    - C: A greater emphasis on language instruction\n    - D: A rejection of the theory of universal grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n(No refinement needed)\n\n11) What is one potential limitation of Chomsky's theory of universal grammar?\n    - A: It fails to account for language variation and change\n    - B: It overemphasizes the role of environment in language acquisition\n    - C: It is too broad and fails to provide specific predictions\n    - D: The discovery of the Piraha language, which doesn't appear to have recursive structures\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n(Refined to make the correct answer more specific)\n\n12) Why might the study of universal grammar be important for understanding human language and cognition?\n    - A: Because it provides a set of rigid rules for language instruction\n    - B: Because it helps to explain the neural basis of language processing\n    - C: Because it informs the development of language acquisition theories and models\n    - D: Because it challenges the dominant paradigm of behaviorism and provides insight into the human brain\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n(Refined to make the correct answer more specific)\n\nAdditional questions:\n\n13) What is the name of the Amazonian language that challenges Chomsky's theory of universal grammar?\n    - A: Piraha\n    - B: Warao\n    - C: Yanomami\n    - D: Ticuna\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) What is the term for the ability to nest structures inside each other, proposed by Chomsky as a universal grammar rule?\n    - A: Recursion\n    - B: Embedding\n    - C: Nesting\n    - D: Hierarchy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n15) What is the name of the hypothesis proposed by Chomsky to accommodate language variation?\n    - A: Principles and parameters\n    - B: Universal grammar\n    - C: Generative syntax\n    - D: Transformational grammar\n[Correct answer]: A"
