    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many base pairs of DNA are stored in the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each person's body?\n    - A: 3 billion\n    - B: 6 billion\n    - C: 9 billion\n    - D: 12 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the human genome is shared among all humans?\n    - A: 90%\n    - B: 95%\n    - C: 99%\n    - D: 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why can DNA tests provide unexpected results when trying to determine ancestry from a particular region?\n    - A: Because the tests only analyze a small portion of the DNA\n    - B: Because the story of our ancestry becomes complex due to recombination and the limited DNA data used for testing\n    - C: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - D: Because the tests are only used for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What do DNA tests compare an individual's DNA to in order to determine ancestry?\n    - A: The DNA of actual ancestors\n    - B: The DNA of people living in a specific region today\n    - C: The DNA of people from different ethnic groups\n    - D: The DNA of people from different countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why is it problematic to use DNA tests to prove race or ethnicity?\n    - A: Because the concept of race and ethnicity is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple DNA test\n    - B: Because the database used for DNA testing is biased towards people of European descent\n    - C: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - D: Because the tests are too expensive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What are some limitations of using DNA tests to determine ancestry?\n    - A: The tests are not accurate\n    - B: The database used for DNA testing is biased towards people of European descent, and the concept of ancestry is complex\n    - C: The tests are too expensive\n    - D: The tests can only be used for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is recombination, and how does it affect the DNA of offspring?\n    - A: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg are identical to the chromosomes of every other cell in the body\n    - B: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg swap some sections, creating a unique mashup of each pair\n    - C: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg are randomly selected from the parents' chromosomes\n    - D: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg are identical to the chromosomes of the parents\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does it mean when a DNA test shows that an individual is a certain percentage of a particular ancestry?\n    - A: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of ancestors from that region\n    - B: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of DNA that is similar to the DNA of people living in that region today\n    - C: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of DNA that is identical to the DNA of people living in that region today\n    - D: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of ancestors who were definitely from that region\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the results of a DNA test change over time?\n    - A: The results can change as more people get sequenced and the database used for DNA testing expands\n    - B: The results can change as the individual's DNA changes over time\n    - C: The results can change as the tests become more accurate\n    - D: The results can change as the individual's ancestry changes over time\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is one of the limitations of DNA tests in determining ancestry?\n    - A: The tests are too expensive\n    - B: The tests are not accurate\n    - C: The database used for DNA testing is biased towards people of European descent\n    - D: The tests only analyze a small portion of the DNA\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Why is it essential to understand how DNA tests work and their limitations?\n    - A: So that individuals can make informed decisions about using the tests to explore their ancestry\n    - B: So that individuals can prove their race or ethnicity\n    - C: So that individuals can determine their exact ancestry\n    - D: So that individuals can ignore the limitations of the tests\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What can combining the concepts of DNA tests, recombination, and the limitations of the database used for testing provide?\n    - A: A more accurate determination of ancestry\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the complexities of exploring ancestry through DNA\n    - C: A way to prove race or ethnicity\n    - D: A way to ignore the limitations of the tests\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What can recognizing the limitations of DNA tests lead to?\n    - A: A more nuanced understanding of the relationship between DNA and ancestry\n    - B: A way to prove race or ethnicity\n    - C: A way to ignore the limitations of the tests\n    - D: A more accurate determination of ancestry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI have made some minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision. However, overall, the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Therefore, I conclude that no further refinement is necessary.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
