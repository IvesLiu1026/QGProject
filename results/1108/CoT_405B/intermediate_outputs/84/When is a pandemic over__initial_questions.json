What would be the primary benefit of this approach?\n    - A: Prioritizing speed over lives\n    - B: Slowing the spread of the disease while developing and distributing vaccines\n    - C: Reducing economic disruption\n    - D: Increasing public awareness about the risks of the pandemic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A public health official is developing a plan to prepare for a pandemic.
