    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many base pairs of DNA are stored in the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each person's body?\n    - A: 3 billion\n    - B: 6 billion\n    - C: 9 billion\n    - D: 12 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the human genome is shared among all humans?\n    - A: 90%\n    - B: 95%\n    - C: 99%\n    - D: 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why can DNA tests provide baffling results when trying to determine ancestry from a particular region?\n    - A: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - B: Because the story of our ancestry becomes muddled before conception due to recombination\n    - C: Because the tests only look at a small portion of the DNA\n    - D: Because the tests are only used for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B (Modified to make option C more specific) \n3) Why can DNA tests provide baffling results when trying to determine ancestry from a particular region?\n    - A: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - B: Because the story of our ancestry becomes muddled before conception due to recombination\n    - C: Because the tests only analyze less than 1% of the 1% of DNA that varies among individuals\n    - D: Because the tests are only used for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What do DNA tests compare an individual's DNA to in order to determine ancestry?\n    - A: The DNA of actual ancestors\n    - B: The DNA of people living in a specific region today\n    - C: The DNA of people from different ethnic groups\n    - D: The DNA of people from different countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What should individuals do when interpreting the results of a DNA test?\n    - A: Take the results at face value\n    - B: Interpret the results with caution\n    - C: Ignore the results if they don't match what they expected\n    - D: Use the results to prove their race or ethnicity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can understanding how DNA tests work help individuals?\n    - A: It can help them make informed decisions about using the tests to explore their ancestry\n    - B: It can help them prove their race or ethnicity\n    - C: It can help them determine their exact ancestry\n    - D: It can help them ignore the limitations of the tests\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is one of the limitations of DNA tests in determining ancestry?\n    - A: The tests are too expensive\n    - B: The tests are not accurate\n    - C: The database used for DNA testing is biased towards people of European descent\n    - D: The tests only look at a small portion of the DNA\n[Correct answer]: C (Modified to make option D more specific) \n7) What is one of the limitations of DNA tests in determining ancestry?\n    - A: The tests are too expensive\n    - B: The tests are not accurate\n    - C: The database used for DNA testing is biased towards people of European descent\n    - D: The tests only analyze less than 1% of the 1% of DNA that varies among individuals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How can the process of recombination affect the accuracy of DNA tests?\n    - A: It can make the tests more accurate\n    - B: It can make the tests less accurate\n    - C: It has no effect on the accuracy of the tests\n    - D: It can only affect the tests for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can combining the concepts of DNA tests, recombination, and the limitations of the database used for testing provide?\n    - A: A more accurate determination of ancestry\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the complexities of exploring ancestry through DNA\n    - C: A way to prove race or ethnicity\n    - D: A way to ignore the limitations of the tests\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can recognizing the limitations of DNA tests lead to?\n    - A: A more nuanced understanding of the relationship between DNA and ancestry\n    - B: A way to prove race or ethnicity\n    - C: A way to ignore the limitations of the tests\n    - D: A more accurate determination of ancestry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why is using DNA tests to prove race or ethnicity problematic?\n    - A: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - B: Because the tests are biased towards people of European descent\n    - C: Because the concept of race and ethnicity is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple DNA test\n    - D: Because the tests are too expensive\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What should be done to improve the accuracy of DNA tests?\n    - A: The database used for DNA testing should be expanded to include more diverse populations\n    - B: The tests should only be used for people of European descent\n    - C: The tests should be made more expensive\n    - D: The tests should be made less accurate\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding a few more questions to cover some key concepts:\n\n13) What is recombination, and how does it affect the DNA of offspring?\n    - A: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg are identical to the chromosomes of every other cell in the body\n    - B: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg swap some sections, creating a unique mashup of each pair\n    - C: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg are randomly selected from the parents' chromosomes\n    - D: Recombination is the process by which the chromosomes in a sperm or egg are identical to the chromosomes of the parents\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What does it mean when a DNA test shows that an individual is a certain percentage of a particular ancestry?\n    - A: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of ancestors from that region\n    - B: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of DNA that is similar to the DNA of people living in that region today\n    - C: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of DNA that is identical to the DNA of people living in that region today\n    - D: It means that the individual has a certain percentage of ancestors who were definitely from that region\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) How can the results of a DNA test change over time?\n    - A: The results can change as more people get sequenced and the database used for DNA testing expands\n    - B: The results can change as the individual's DNA changes over time\n    - C: The results can change as the tests become more accurate\n    - D: The results can change as the individual's ancestry changes over time\n[Correct answer]: A"
