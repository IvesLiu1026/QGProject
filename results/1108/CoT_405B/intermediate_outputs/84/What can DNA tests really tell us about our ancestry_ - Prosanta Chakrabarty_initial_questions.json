    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) How many base pairs of DNA are stored in the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each person's body?\n    - A: 3 billion\n    - B: 6 billion\n    - C: 9 billion\n    - D: 12 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the human genome is shared among all humans?\n    - A: 90%\n    - B: 95%\n    - C: 99%\n    - D: 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) Why can DNA tests provide baffling results when trying to determine ancestry from a particular region?\n    - A: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - B: Because the story of our ancestry becomes muddled before conception due to recombination\n    - C: Because the tests only look at a small portion of the DNA\n    - D: Because the tests are only used for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What do DNA tests compare an individual's DNA to in order to determine ancestry?\n    - A: The DNA of actual ancestors\n    - B: The DNA of people living in a specific region today\n    - C: The DNA of people from different ethnic groups\n    - D: The DNA of people from different countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) What should individuals do when interpreting the results of a DNA test?\n    - A: Take the results at face value\n    - B: Interpret the results with caution\n    - C: Ignore the results if they don't match what they expected\n    - D: Use the results to prove their race or ethnicity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can understanding how DNA tests work help individuals?\n    - A: It can help them make informed decisions about using the tests to explore their ancestry\n    - B: It can help them prove their race or ethnicity\n    - C: It can help them determine their exact ancestry\n    - D: It can help them ignore the limitations of the tests\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is one of the limitations of DNA tests in determining ancestry?\n    - A: The tests are too expensive\n    - B: The tests are not accurate\n    - C: The database used for DNA testing is biased towards people of European descent\n    - D: The tests only look at a small portion of the DNA\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the process of recombination affect the accuracy of DNA tests?\n    - A: It can make the tests more accurate\n    - B: It can make the tests less accurate\n    - C: It has no effect on the accuracy of the tests\n    - D: It can only affect the tests for people of European descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What can combining the concepts of DNA tests, recombination, and the limitations of the database used for testing provide?\n    - A: A more accurate determination of ancestry\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the complexities of exploring ancestry through DNA\n    - C: A way to prove race or ethnicity\n    - D: A way to ignore the limitations of the tests\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can recognizing the limitations of DNA tests lead to?\n    - A: A more nuanced understanding of the relationship between DNA and ancestry\n    - B: A way to prove race or ethnicity\n    - C: A way to ignore the limitations of the tests\n    - D: A more accurate determination of ancestry\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) Why is using DNA tests to prove race or ethnicity problematic?\n    - A: Because the tests are not accurate\n    - B: Because the tests are biased towards people of European descent\n    - C: Because the concept of race and ethnicity is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple DNA test\n    - D: Because the tests are too expensive\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What should be done to improve the accuracy of DNA tests?\n    - A: The database used for DNA testing should be expanded to include more diverse populations\n    - B: The tests should only be used for people of European descent\n    - C: The tests should be made more expensive\n    - D: The tests should be made less accurate\n[Correct answer]: A"
