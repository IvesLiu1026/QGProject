    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) Who proposed the theory of universal grammar in the early 1950s?\n    - A: B.F. Skinner\n    - B: Noam Chomsky\n    - C: Jean Piaget\n    - D: Lev Vygotsky\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the analytical tool developed by Chomsky to establish universal rules of grammar?\n    - A: Generative semantics\n    - B: Generative syntax\n    - C: Transformational grammar\n    - D: Structural linguistics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) According to the theory of universal grammar, what is the primary reason humans can come up with an infinite number of sentences in their native language?\n    - A: Because language is learned through imitation\n    - B: Because the human brain is hardwired to process language according to innate rules\n    - C: Because language is a product of culture and environment\n    - D: Because language is a finite system with a limited number of possible combinations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What are the two main components of universal grammar, according to the theory?\n    - A: The existence of universal grammar rules and the role of environment in language acquisition\n    - B: The existence of universal grammar rules and whether these rules are hardwired in the brain\n    - C: The existence of language variation and the importance of language instruction\n    - D: The existence of language universals and the role of culture in language acquisition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) How can understanding universal grammar help language learners and teachers?\n    - A: By providing a set of rigid rules to follow\n    - B: By developing more effective language instruction methods\n    - C: By ignoring the role of innate rules in language acquisition\n    - D: By focusing solely on language variation and change\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is one potential application of the concept of universal grammar in the field of artificial intelligence?\n    - A: Developing more advanced machine learning algorithms\n    - B: Creating more realistic language models for natural language processing\n    - C: Improving the accuracy of speech recognition systems\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between universal grammar and language acquisition, according to the theory?\n    - A: Innate rules have no influence on language learning\n    - B: Innate rules influence language learning, but only in a minor way\n    - C: Innate rules play a significant role in shaping language acquisition\n    - D: Language acquisition is solely the result of environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does the theory of universal grammar contrast with the behaviorist paradigm?\n    - A: The theory of universal grammar emphasizes the role of environment in language acquisition, while behaviorism emphasizes the role of innate rules\n    - B: The theory of universal grammar emphasizes the role of innate rules in language acquisition, while behaviorism emphasizes the role of environment\n    - C: The theory of universal grammar and behaviorism both emphasize the role of innate rules in language acquisition\n    - D: The theory of universal grammar and behaviorism both emphasize the role of environment in language acquisition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What might be the result of integrating the principles and parameters hypothesis with language acquisition theories?\n    - A: A more comprehensive model of language learning that takes into account both innate rules and environmental factors\n    - B: A more rigid set of rules for language instruction\n    - C: A greater emphasis on language variation and change\n    - D: A rejection of the theory of universal grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What might be the benefit of combining the concept of universal grammar with findings from cognitive science?\n    - A: A better understanding of the neural basis of language processing\n    - B: A more comprehensive model of language acquisition\n    - C: A greater emphasis on language instruction\n    - D: A rejection of the theory of universal grammar\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is one potential limitation of Chomsky's theory of universal grammar?\n    - A: It fails to account for language variation and change\n    - B: It overemphasizes the role of environment in language acquisition\n    - C: It is too broad and fails to provide specific predictions\n    - D: It is too narrow and fails to account for the complexity of human language\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Why might the study of universal grammar be important for understanding human language and cognition?\n    - A: Because it provides a set of rigid rules for language instruction\n    - B: Because it helps to explain the neural basis of language processing\n    - C: Because it informs the development of language acquisition theories and models\n    - D: Because it challenges the dominant paradigm of behaviorism\n[Correct answer]: D"
