Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a belly button, also known as a navel?\n    - A: A birthmark that appears after birth\n    - B: A scar that forms during fetal development\n    - C: A flexible tube that carries oxygen and nutrients\n    - D: A remnant of the placenta\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which of the following animals do not have belly buttons?\n    - A: Mammals, such as dogs and cats\n    - B: Primates, such as chimps and gorillas\n    - C: Animals that lay eggs, such as most birds and reptiles\n    - D: All vertebrates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary function of the umbilical cord during fetal development?\n    - A: To regulate the baby's body temperature\n    - B: To provide oxygen and nutrients to the baby\n    - C: To remove waste products from the baby's body\n    - D: To support the mother's health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the belly button a remnant of?\n    - A: The placenta\n    - B: The umbilical cord\n    - C: The amniotic sac\n    - D: The birth canal\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding the importance of the umbilical cord and belly button help us appreciate?\n    - A: The complexities of human digestion\n    - B: The intricacies of the human immune system\n    - C: The complexities of fetal development and childbirth\n    - D: The importance of postnatal care\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can recognizing that many animals have belly buttons help us understand?\n    - A: The differences between human and animal biology\n    - B: The similarities between human and animal biology\n    - C: The importance of conservation efforts\n    - D: The role of genetics in development\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What does the relationship between the umbilical cord and the belly button highlight?\n    - A: The importance of the placenta in fetal development\n    - B: The critical role of the cord in fetal development\n    - C: The function of the amniotic sac\n    - D: The process of childbirth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does comparing human and animal belly buttons reveal?\n    - A: Only differences between species\n    - B: Only similarities between species\n    - C: Both similarities and differences between species\n    - D: Neither similarities nor differences between species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can combining knowledge of human and animal biology help us understand?\n    - A: The evolution of the human brain\n    - B: The development of unique characteristics, such as belly buttons\n    - C: The importance of environmental conservation\n    - D: The role of genetics in disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can recognizing the importance of the umbilical cord and belly button lead to?\n    - A: A greater appreciation for the biology of different species\n    - B: A greater appreciation for the intricate processes involved in fetal development and childbirth\n    - C: A greater appreciation for the importance of postnatal care\n    - D: A greater appreciation for the role of nutrition in human health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is it important to understand the biology of belly buttons and their role in human and animal development?\n    - A: It has no significance in understanding human or animal biology\n    - B: It helps us appreciate the complexities of fetal development and childbirth\n    - C: It informs our understanding of conservation efforts\n    - D: It has only historical significance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the significance of evaluating the similarities and differences between human and animal biology, particularly in regards to reproductive strategies?\n    - A: It helps us understand the importance of conservation efforts\n    - B: It informs our understanding of the biology of different species\n    - C: It allows us to appreciate the diversity of reproductive strategies in the animal kingdom\n    - D: It has no practical applications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed no questions, as all questions align with the key concepts in the transcript and are clear, concise, and accurate. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
