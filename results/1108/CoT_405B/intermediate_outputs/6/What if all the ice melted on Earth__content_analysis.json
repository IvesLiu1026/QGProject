    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge:**\n\n1. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.\n2. Only 3% of the world's water is non-salty (freshwater).\n3. 70% of the world's freshwater is frozen.\n4. There are 30 million cubic kilometers of frozen water on Earth.\n5. If all the ice melted, sea levels would rise by 70 meters.\n6. Half of the world's citizens live on sea coasts.\n7. The extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for January, February, April, May, and June 2016.\n8. The majority of Earth's ice (more than 95%) is land-based and contained in enormous ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The effects of climate change on the Arctic and its ice.\n2. The differences between floating sea ice and land-based ice in terms of their impact on sea levels.\n3. The consequences of melting sea ice on marine species and their habitats.\n4. The process of seismic blasting and its detrimental effects on the Arctic ecosystem.\n5. The importance of ocean currents and their potential disruption due to melting ice.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Understanding the impact of climate change on global shipping routes and commerce.\n2. Recognizing the potential consequences of rising sea levels on coastal cities and communities.\n3. Applying knowledge of ocean currents to predict changes in regional climate patterns.\n4. Using awareness of the effects of seismic blasting to inform conservation efforts.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between melting ice and rising global temperatures.\n2. The contrast between the effects of melting sea ice and land-based ice on sea levels.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between climate change and the loss of habitats for marine species.\n4. The potential disruption of ocean currents and its impact on global climate patterns.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining knowledge of climate change, ocean currents, and sea ice to predict future changes in global climate patterns.\n2. Integrating understanding of the effects of seismic blasting with awareness of the importance of conservation efforts in the Arctic.\n3. Synthesizing information about rising sea levels, coastal communities, and global commerce to inform policy decisions.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Judging the severity of the consequences of climate change on the Arctic and its ice.\n2. Evaluating the effectiveness of conservation efforts, such as preventing seismic blasting, in protecting the Arctic ecosystem.\n3. Assessing the potential economic and social impacts of rising sea levels on coastal communities and global commerce.\n4. Justifying the need for policy changes and conservation efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change."
