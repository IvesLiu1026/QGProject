    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of memory is responsible for skills, motions, and movements, such as riding a bike?\n    - A: Declarative memory\n    - B: Non-declarative memory\n    - C: Short-term memory\n    - D: Long-term memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which part of the brain plays a crucial role in declarative memory function, enabling us to retain and recall facts and events?\n    - A: Cerebral cortex\n    - B: Hippocampus\n    - C: Cerebellum\n    - D: Brainstem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the likely cause of the pilot's incorrect response to a stall, resulting in a fatal accident?\n    - A: Lack of sleep\n    - B: Failure to recall basic emergency training\n    - C: Mechanical failure\n    - D: Bad weather\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to the concept of transactive memory, how can technology affect our memory?\n    - A: By increasing the need to recall facts and information\n    - B: By reducing the need to recall facts and information\n    - C: By having no effect on memory\n    - D: By improving memory capabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what type of situation would a pilot need to rely on their memory to recall basic emergency training?\n    - A: During a routine flight\n    - B: During a high-pressure situation\n    - C: During a simulation\n    - D: During a lecture\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the Google effect manifest in everyday life, according to research?\n    - A: As an improvement in memory capabilities\n    - B: As a decrease in the recall of information\n    - C: As an increase in the use of books\n    - D: As a decrease in the use of technology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between technology and memory, according to the concept of transactive memory?\n    - A: Only positive effects\n    - B: Only negative effects\n    - C: Complex, with both positive and negative effects\n    - D: No effect\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What can be a result of relying on external memory systems, such as Google?\n    - A: An increase in the recall of facts and information\n    - B: A decrease in the recall of facts and information\n    - C: No effect on memory\n    - D: An improvement in memory capabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What concept can be combined with the idea of the Google effect to understand how technology is changing the way we remember and recall information?\n    - A: Collective intelligence\n    - B: Transactive memory\n    - C: Declarative memory\n    - D: Non-declarative memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be seen as a result of the Google effect, where individuals contribute to a shared knowledge base?\n    - A: Collective ignorance\n    - B: Collective intelligence\n    - C: Individual intelligence\n    - D: Shared memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What can be said about the Google effect, considering its impact on memory and recall?\n    - A: It is only a positive phenomenon\n    - B: It is only a negative phenomenon\n    - C: It is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative effects\n    - D: It has no impact on memory and recall\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What can be said about the use of external memory systems, such as Google, considering its impact on memory and recall?\n    - A: It is a crutch that should be avoided\n    - B: It is a tool that can be useful in certain situations\n    - C: It is a necessity in today's world\n    - D: It is a luxury that few can afford\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made minor adjustments to the wording of some questions to enhance clarity and conciseness. I also reviewed the distractors to ensure they are plausible but incorrect. The correct answers remain accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
