    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial questions, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What percentage of the world's freshwater is frozen?\n    - A: 30%\n    - B: 50%\n    - C: 70%\n    - D: 90%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) How many cubic kilometers of frozen water are on Earth?\n    - A: 10 million\n    - B: 20 million\n    - C: 30 million\n    - D: 40 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary difference between the impact of melting sea ice and land-based ice on sea levels?\n    - A: Melting sea ice causes sea levels to rise, while melting land-based ice has no effect.\n    - B: Melting land-based ice causes sea levels to rise, while melting sea ice has no effect.\n    - C: Melting sea ice causes sea levels to drop, while melting land-based ice causes sea levels to rise.\n    - D: Melting land-based ice causes sea levels to drop, while melting sea ice causes sea levels to rise.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is a significant consequence of melting sea ice on marine species and their habitats?\n    - A: Increased food availability\n    - B: Improved breeding grounds\n    - C: Loss of habitats and reduced biodiversity\n    - D: Enhanced migration patterns\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of climate change on shipping routes through the Arctic?\n    - A: Increased sea ice coverage\n    - B: Decreased ocean currents\n    - C: Shorter shipping seasons due to more frequent and severe storms\n    - D: Increased access to previously ice-covered areas\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What should coastal cities consider due to rising sea levels?\n    - A: Increased property values\n    - B: Improved beach access\n    - C: Potential flooding and saltwater intrusion\n    - D: Reduced storm surges\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between melting ice and rising global temperatures?\n    - A: Melting ice causes global temperatures to drop.\n    - B: Melting ice has no effect on global temperatures.\n    - C: Melting ice contributes to rising global temperatures.\n    - D: Rising global temperatures have no effect on melting ice.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the primary cause of the loss of habitats for marine species due to climate change?\n    - A: Overfishing\n    - B: Pollution\n    - C: Melting sea ice and changes in ocean currents\n    - D: Coastal development\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How might changes in ocean currents and sea ice coverage affect global climate patterns?\n    - A: They would have no impact on global climate patterns.\n    - B: They would lead to a decrease in global temperatures.\n    - C: They would cause more frequent and severe storms.\n    - D: They would lead to changes in regional climate patterns and potentially more extreme weather events.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What might be an effective way to mitigate the effects of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem?\n    - A: Increasing seismic blasting for oil exploration\n    - B: Implementing conservation efforts, such as preventing seismic blasting\n    - C: Reducing global temperatures by 1°C\n    - D: Increasing global temperatures by 1°C\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the potential consequence of a 10m sea level rise?\n    - A: Displacement of 100 million people\n    - B: Displacement of 630 million people\n    - C: Displacement of 1 billion people\n    - D: No displacement of people\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) How might the melting of ice in Greenland affect the Gulf Stream?\n    - A: It would have no effect on the Gulf Stream.\n    - B: It would cause the Gulf Stream to shift, potentially leading to changes in regional climate patterns.\n    - C: It would cause the Gulf Stream to strengthen, leading to increased warming in Europe.\n    - D: It would cause the Gulf Stream to weaken, leading to decreased warming in Europe.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nHowever, I suggest adding a question to address the concept of the feedback mechanism mentioned in the transcript:\n\n13) What is the feedback mechanism associated with melting ice and rising global temperatures?\n    - A: Melting ice absorbs more sunlight, leading to lower global temperatures.\n    - B: Melting ice reflects less sunlight, leading to higher global temperatures.\n    - C: Melting ice has no effect on global temperatures.\n    - D: Rising global temperatures cause ice to melt, but there is no feedback mechanism.\n[Correct answer]: B"
