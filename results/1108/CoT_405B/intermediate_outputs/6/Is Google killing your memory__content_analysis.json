    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. In 2009, a plane crashed into a house near Buffalo, New York, due to the pilot's incorrect response to a stall.\n2. There are two types of memory: non-declarative (skills, motions, movements) and declarative (facts, information).\n3. The hippocampus is a major part of the brain involved in declarative memory function.\n4. The parahippocampal gyrus is a region around the hippocampus involved in forming new declarative memories.\n5. The Google effect refers to the phenomenon where people remember where to find information rather than the information itself.\n6. Transactive memory refers to the use of external memory systems, such as books or other people.\n7. Einstein said, \"I do not carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books.\"\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The pilot's incorrect response to a stall was likely due to a lack of recall of basic emergency training.\n2. Technology can affect our memory by reducing the need to recall facts and information.\n3. The brain's ability to form and retain declarative memories relies on both the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus.\n4. The use of external memory systems, such as Google, can change what we choose to form memories about.\n5. The concept of transactive memory is not new and has been used in various forms throughout history.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Pilots need to recall basic emergency training in high-pressure situations.\n2. The use of technology, such as Google, can affect our ability to recall information in everyday life.\n3. The concept of transactive memory can be applied to various situations, such as relying on others to remember information.\n4. The Google effect can be seen in various aspects of life, such as education and work.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between technology and memory is complex, with both positive and negative effects.\n2. The use of external memory systems, such as Google, can lead to a decrease in the recall of facts and information.\n3. The brain's ability to form and retain declarative memories is affected by the use of technology.\n4. The Google effect can be seen as a trade-off between the convenience of having information at our fingertips and the potential loss of recall abilities.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The concept of transactive memory can be combined with the idea of the Google effect to understand how technology is changing the way we remember and recall information.\n2. The use of technology, such as Google, can be seen as a form of \"outsourcing\" our memory, allowing us to focus on other aspects of life.\n3. The idea of collective intelligence can be seen as a result of the Google effect, where individuals contribute to a shared knowledge base.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Is the Google effect a positive or negative phenomenon?\n2. Is the use of external memory systems, such as Google, a crutch or a tool?\n3. Should we be concerned about the potential loss of recall abilities due to the use of technology?\n4. Is the concept of collective intelligence a valid justification for the Google effect?"
