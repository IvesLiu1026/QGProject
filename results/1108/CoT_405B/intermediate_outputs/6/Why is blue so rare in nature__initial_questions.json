    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1) What is unique about the coloration of Blue Morpho butterflies?\n    - A: They have blue pigment in their wings.\n    - B: They have microscopic structures that create the color blue.\n    - C: They have a special type of scales that reflect all colors.\n    - D: They have a pigment that absorbs all colors except blue.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why do flamingos turn pink?\n    - A: Due to the presence of blue pigment in their diet.\n    - B: Due to the presence of carotenoids in their diet.\n    - C: Due to the absence of red pigment in their diet.\n    - D: Due to the presence of green pigment in their diet.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1) How do butterfly wings display colors, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Through the reflection of light on the surface of the wing.\n    - B: Through the creation of pigments from scratch.\n    - C: Through the arrangement of tiny scales containing pigments.\n    - D: Through the absorption of all colors except the desired one.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is unique about the way blue is created in nature, according to the speaker?\n    - A: It is created by pigments like all other colors.\n    - B: It is created by microscopic structures, unlike other colors.\n    - C: It is created by the reflection of light on the surface of objects.\n    - D: It is created by the absorption of all colors except blue.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application:**\n\n1) How can the understanding of how microscopic structures create colors be applied?\n    - A: To the study of animal behavior and ecology.\n    - B: To the development of new materials and technologies.\n    - C: To the creation of new pigments or dyes.\n    - D: To the understanding of the evolution of colors in nature.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential application of the concept of how animals use colors to communicate?\n    - A: The development of new blue pigments or dyes.\n    - B: The creation of new materials and technologies.\n    - C: The study of animal behavior and ecology.\n    - D: The understanding of the evolution of colors in nature.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the arrangement of branches in the microscopic structure of the Blue Morpho butterfly's wing and the creation of the blue color?\n    - A: The arrangement of branches absorbs all colors except blue.\n    - B: The arrangement of branches reflects all colors except blue.\n    - C: The arrangement of branches creates the blue color through the reflection of light.\n    - D: The arrangement of branches has no effect on the creation of the blue color.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does the presence of other substances, like alcohol, affect the blue color of the Blue Morpho butterfly's wing?\n    - A: It enhances the blue color.\n    - B: It changes the blue color to a different color.\n    - C: It causes the blue color to disappear.\n    - D: It has no effect on the blue color.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) What is the result of combining the concepts of evolution, chemistry, and physics to explain why blue is a rare color in nature?\n    - A: Blue is a common color in nature because it is easy to create.\n    - B: Blue is a rare color in nature because it is difficult to create through pigments.\n    - C: Blue is a rare color in nature because it is not necessary for communication.\n    - D: Blue is a common color in nature because it is necessary for communication.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the result of synthesizing the information about how colors are created in nature to explain the uniqueness of blue?\n    - A: Blue is unique because it is created by pigments like all other colors.\n    - B: Blue is unique because it is created by microscopic structures, unlike other colors.\n    - C: Blue is unique because it is not necessary for communication.\n    - D: Blue is not unique because it is created like all other colors.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) Why is the study of the creation of colors in nature important, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Because it can lead to the discovery of new pigments or dyes.\n    - B: Because it can lead to a better understanding of animal behavior and ecology.\n    - C: Because it can lead to the development of new materials and technologies.\n    - D: Because it can lead to a better understanding of the evolution of colors in nature.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the significance of the discovery of the Blue Morpho butterfly's wing structure, according to the speaker?\n    - A: It shows that blue is a common color in nature.\n    - B: It shows that blue is a rare color in nature because it is difficult to create through pigments.\n    - C: It shows that microscopic structures can create colors, not just pigments.\n    - D: It shows that the study of color creation in nature is not important.\n[Correct answer]: C"
