    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is credited with discovering the principle of refraction using a glass of water around 2000 years ago?\n    - A: Galen\n    - B: Hippocrates\n    - C: Seneca\n    - D: Euclid\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) In what year did Edward Scarlett develop the modern style of glasses with arms that hook over each ear?\n    - A: 1627\n    - B: 1727\n    - C: 1827\n    - D: 1927\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of refraction in the human eye?\n    - A: To change the color of light\n    - B: To reduce the intensity of light\n    - C: To focus light on the retina\n    - D: To adjust the eye's sensitivity to light\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What type of refractive error occurs as people age and the lens becomes less flexible?\n    - A: Myopia\n    - B: Hyperopia\n    - C: Astigmatism\n    - D: Presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is a common way to correct refractive errors in everyday life?\n    - A: Using a magnifying glass\n    - B: Wearing glasses or contact lenses\n    - C: Undergoing eye surgery\n    - D: Using corrective software\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the primary cause of presbyopia?\n    - A: Genetics\n    - B: Injury to the eye\n    - C: Aging and reduced lens flexibility\n    - D: Prolonged screen time\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do glasses and contact lenses work to correct refractive errors?\n    - A: By changing the shape of the cornea\n    - B: By refocusing light on the retina\n    - C: By adjusting the eye's sensitivity to light\n    - D: By reducing eye strain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the name of the refractive error that occurs when the cornea has a non-spherical shape, causing blurred vision at all distances?\n    - A: Myopia\n    - B: Hyperopia\n    - C: Astigmatism\n    - D: Presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How have advancements in technology impacted the design and functionality of glasses?\n    - A: They have made glasses more expensive\n    - B: They have reduced the effectiveness of glasses\n    - C: They have improved the design and functionality of glasses, making them more precise and personalized\n    - D: They have made glasses more fashionable but less functional\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the estimated number of people worldwide who have a problem with close or far vision, or both?\n    - A: 100 million\n    - B: 200 million\n    - C: 500 million\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to question 1, replacing the distractors with more plausible options. The rest of the questions remain unchanged as they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
