    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which organ did Charles Darwin consider more impressive than the human brain?\n    - A: The brain of a mammal\n    - B: The brain of an ant\n    - C: The brain of a bird\n    - D: The human heart\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What assumption did Carl Linnaeus make about insects during his classification project?\n    - A: They had complex brains similar to humans\n    - B: They had simple brains with limited functions\n    - C: They had no brains at all\n    - D: They had a decentralized nervous system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is a key difference between the human nervous system and the insect nervous system?\n    - A: The human nervous system is decentralized, while the insect nervous system is centralized\n    - B: The human nervous system is centralized, while the insect nervous system is decentralized\n    - C: The human nervous system relies solely on the brain, while the insect nervous system uses both the brain and local ganglia\n    - D: The human nervous system is larger and more complex\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the language more concise and accurate.\n\n4) What is the primary function of ganglia in the insect nervous system?\n    - A: To control the brain and make decisions\n    - B: To coordinate activities such as walking and breathing\n    - C: To regulate communication and navigation\n    - D: To perceive the world through sight and smell\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What is an example of a similarity between the insect brain and the human brain?\n    - A: The structure of the visual cortex\n    - B: The organization of the motor system\n    - C: The presence of smell detectors and similar olfactory brain regions\n    - D: The use of a centralized nervous system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What phenomenon describes the evolution of similar brain structures in different species despite having different evolutionary paths?\n    - A: Convergent evolution\n    - B: Divergent evolution\n    - C: Parallel evolution\n    - D: Co-evolution\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) Why are scientists interested in studying the comparison between insect and human brains?\n    - A: To understand which brain functions are unique to humans\n    - B: To understand which brain functions are general solutions to evolutionary problems\n    - C: To design more complex computer systems\n    - D: Both A and B\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is an application of studying the insect brain in engineering?\n    - A: Designing more complex computer systems\n    - B: Developing more efficient algorithms\n    - C: Creating control systems for self-flying airplanes and search-and-rescue roach bots\n    - D: Building more advanced robots with centralized nervous systems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nThese questions align with the key concepts in the transcript and are clear, concise, and accurate. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
