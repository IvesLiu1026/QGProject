    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and the initial set of questions, I have refined the questions to ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of people are missing the palmaris longus muscle on one or both arms?\n    - A: 5-10%\n    - B: 10-15%\n    - C: 15-20%\n    - D: 20-25%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the tiny muscles attached to body hairs?\n    - A: To detect sound sources\n    - B: To move the ear\n    - C: To pull the hair upright and cause goosebumps\n    - D: To increase grip strength\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why do vestigial body parts, such as the palmaris longus muscle, still exist in humans?\n    - A: They are essential for our survival\n    - B: They are remnants of our deep history and only make sense within the framework of evolution by natural selection\n    - C: They are necessary for our physical strength\n    - D: They are useless and should be removed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the role of the ear muscles in humans?\n    - A: To move the ear\n    - B: To detect sound sources, although the movement is not visible\n    - C: To increase hearing ability\n    - D: To maintain balance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a possible use of the palmaris longus tendon in medical procedures?\n    - A: To repair damaged heart tissue\n    - B: To reconstruct damaged skin\n    - C: To perform cosmetic surgeries\n    - D: Both B and C\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What can be inferred from the presence of vestigial body parts, such as the palmar grasp reflex, in infants?\n    - A: That humans are not evolved from other species\n    - B: That vestigial body parts are unnecessary and can be removed without consequences\n    - C: That humans have a complex evolutionary history\n    - D: That vestigial body parts are essential for our survival\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the development of the palmaris longus muscle and its function in different mammal species?\n    - A: The muscle is more developed in mammals that use their forelimbs to move around\n    - B: The muscle is less developed in mammals that use their forelimbs to move around\n    - C: The muscle is equally developed in all mammal species\n    - D: The muscle is not developed in any mammal species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the contraction of tiny muscles attached to body hairs and the formation of goosebumps?\n    - A: The contraction of tiny muscles causes the hair to lie flat and reduces goosebumps\n    - B: The contraction of tiny muscles pulls the hair upright and causes goosebumps\n    - C: The contraction of tiny muscles has no effect on goosebumps\n    - D: The contraction of tiny muscles reduces body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be inferred by combining the knowledge of vestigial body parts and their functions?\n    - A: That humans are not evolved from other species\n    - B: That vestigial body parts are unnecessary and can be removed without consequences\n    - C: That humans have a complex evolutionary history\n    - D: That vestigial body parts are essential for our survival\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be understood by recognizing the relationships between different vestigial body parts?\n    - A: The complexity of human development\n    - B: The simplicity of human development\n    - C: The importance of vestigial body parts in medical research\n    - D: The uselessness of vestigial body parts\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why is it important to study vestigial body parts in medical research?\n    - A: Because they are essential for our survival\n    - B: Because they provide insights into the development of new treatments for certain medical conditions\n    - C: Because they are unnecessary and can be removed without consequences\n    - D: Because they are remnants of our deep history\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What justification can be made for using the palmaris longus tendon in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries?\n    - A: Because it is a vestigial body part and can be removed without consequences\n    - B: Because it is a necessary body part and cannot be removed\n    - C: Because it can be used to repair damaged tissue and improve physical appearance\n    - D: Because it is a useless body part and should not be used\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 6 from the initial set as it was not directly related to the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
