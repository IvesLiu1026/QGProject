    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to enhance clarity, conciseness, and accuracy. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is credited with discovering the principle of refraction using a glass of water around 2000 years ago?\n    - A: Galileo Galilei\n    - B: Isaac Newton\n    - C: Seneca\n    - D: Leonardo da Vinci\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) In what year did Edward Scarlett develop the modern style of glasses with arms that hook over each ear?\n    - A: 1627\n    - B: 1727\n    - C: 1827\n    - D: 1927\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of refraction in the human eye?\n    - A: To change the color of light\n    - B: To reduce the intensity of light\n    - C: To focus light on the retina\n    - D: To increase the speed of light\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What type of refractive error occurs as people age and the lens becomes less flexible?\n    - A: Myopia\n    - B: Hyperopia\n    - C: Astigmatism\n    - D: Presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is a common way to correct refractive errors in everyday life?\n    - A: Using a magnifying glass\n    - B: Wearing glasses or contact lenses\n    - C: Undergoing eye surgery\n    - D: Using a flashlight\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the primary cause of presbyopia?\n    - A: Genetics\n    - B: Injury to the eye\n    - C: Aging and reduced lens flexibility\n    - D: Poor eye care\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do glasses and contact lenses work to correct refractive errors?\n    - A: By changing the shape of the cornea\n    - B: By refocusing light on the retina\n    - C: By increasing the intensity of light\n    - D: By reducing the speed of light\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the name of the refractive error that occurs when the cornea has a non-spherical shape, causing blurred vision at all distances?\n    - A: Myopia\n    - B: Hyperopia\n    - C: Astigmatism\n    - D: Presbyopia\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How have advancements in technology impacted the design and functionality of glasses?\n    - A: They have made glasses more expensive\n    - B: They have reduced the effectiveness of glasses\n    - C: They have improved the design and functionality of glasses\n    - D: They have made glasses less accessible\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is it essential to make corrective measures for refractive errors accessible to everyone?\n    - A: To improve fashion\n    - B: To increase social status\n    - C: To improve quality of life and reduce social and economic implications\n    - D: To reduce the need for eye exams\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 10 (initial), 11, and 12, as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript or were too vague. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
