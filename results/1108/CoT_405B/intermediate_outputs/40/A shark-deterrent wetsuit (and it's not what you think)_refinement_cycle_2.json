    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary sensor used by sharks to identify targets in the last few meters before an attack?\n    - A: Smell sensor\n    - B: Sight sensor\n    - C: Hearing sensor\n    - D: Electroreception sensor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many fatal shark attacks occurred in Western Australia within a 10-month period?\n    - A: 3\n    - B: 5\n    - C: 7\n    - D: 10\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the concept behind using patterns and shapes to deter shark attacks?\n    - A: Sharks use echolocation to identify prey\n    - B: Sharks use visual cues to identify prey\n    - C: Sharks use magnetic fields to identify prey\n    - D: Sharks use electrical signals to identify prey\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What are the two types of wetsuits developed by the research team to mitigate shark attacks?\n    - A: Camouflage and reflective wetsuits\n    - B: \"Don't eat me\" and cryptic wetsuits\n    - C: Insulating and buoyant wetsuits\n    - D: Flexible and rigid wetsuits\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential application of the technology developed by SAMS?\n    - A: Reducing pollution in oceans\n    - B: Conserving marine life\n    - C: Mitigating shark attacks in various water sports and activities\n    - D: Studying ocean currents\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How did the research team analyze the physical characteristics of shark eyes?\n    - A: Using genetic analysis only\n    - B: Using anatomical analysis only\n    - C: Using a combination of genetic and anatomical analysis\n    - D: Using computer modeling only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What approach did the speaker use to develop a new method for mitigating shark attacks?\n    - A: Combining ideas from biology and ecology\n    - B: Integrating knowledge from shark vision and neurology\n    - C: Combining ideas from biology, ecology, and design\n    - D: Using a single discipline to develop the approach\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How did the speaker evaluate the effectiveness of the SAMS technology rig?\n    - A: By comparing the behavior of sharks when encountering the control rig versus the SAMS technology rig\n    - B: By assessing the validity of the results using a control group\n    - C: By justifying the use of science as a tool for translation rather than invention\n    - D: By critiquing the traditional approach to innovation and research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) Why did the speaker justify the use of science as a tool for translation rather than invention in the development of the SAMS technology?\n    - A: Because it allows for the development of more effective solutions by building on existing knowledge\n    - B: Because it is a more cost-effective approach\n    - C: Because it is a more efficient approach\n    - D: Because it is a more traditional approach\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What represents a synthesis of scientific knowledge and practical application in the development of the SAMS technology?\n    - A: The use of computer modeling to understand shark vision\n    - B: The development of the SAMS technology rig and the wetsuits that incorporate this technology\n    - C: The research on shark vision and neurology\n    - D: The testing of the wetsuits with sharks in a natural environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not necessary and made the set more concise. I also refined the language and options to make the questions clearer and more accurate."
