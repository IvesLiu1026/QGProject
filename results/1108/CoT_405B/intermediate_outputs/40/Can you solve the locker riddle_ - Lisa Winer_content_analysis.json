    "content_analysis": "Here's the analysis of the transcript based on Bloom's Taxonomy levels:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The uncle left a puzzle in his will for his 100 relatives to solve.\n2. The puzzle involves 100 lockers, each with a single word.\n3. The relatives are assigned numbers from 1 to 100.\n4. Each relative will open or close lockers based on their assigned number.\n5. The words in the lockers that remain open will help crack the code for the safe.\n6. The number of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors in the locker number.\n7. Perfect squares have an odd number of factors.\n8. Prime numbers have only two factors: 1 and themselves.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The uncle created a puzzle to ensure that the inheritance goes to the relative who can solve it first.\n2. The puzzle requires understanding the pattern of opening and closing lockers based on the assigned numbers.\n3. The number of factors in a locker number determines whether it will remain open or closed.\n4. The lockers with an odd number of factors will remain open, while those with an even number of factors will remain closed.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. This puzzle can be applied to real-world scenarios involving pattern recognition and problem-solving.\n2. The concept of factors and prime numbers can be applied to cryptography and coding.\n3. The idea of using puzzles to solve problems can be applied to various fields, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between the number of factors in a locker number and the number of times it is touched.\n2. The contrast between lockers with an odd number of factors (perfect squares) and those with an even number of factors.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the relatives' actions and the final state of the lockers.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Combining the concept of factors and prime numbers to solve the puzzle.\n2. Using the understanding of the puzzle to crack the code for the safe.\n3. Applying the idea of using puzzles to solve problems to real-world scenarios.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of the puzzle in achieving the uncle's goal.\n2. Critiquing the relatives' approach to solving the puzzle (or lack thereof).\n3. Justifying the use of puzzles as a means of problem-solving and critical thinking.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for creating assessment questions that target different levels of cognitive thinking."
