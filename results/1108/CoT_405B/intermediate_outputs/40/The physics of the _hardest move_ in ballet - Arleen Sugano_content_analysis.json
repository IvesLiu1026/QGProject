Fouettés are a series of turns in ballet, meaning \"whipped\" in French.\n2. The Black Swan performs 32 fouettés in the third act of \"Swan Lake.\"\n3. The dancer generates torque by pushing off with her foot.\n4. Friction between the pointe shoe and the floor, and between the body and air, reduces momentum.\n5. Angular momentum is equal to angular velocity times rotational inertia.\n6. Rotational inertia increases when mass is distributed further from the axis of rotation and decreases when mass is distributed closer to the axis of rotation.\n7. Conservation of angular momentum states that angular momentum remains constant, except for what's lost to friction.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The fouetté is a challenging sequence in ballet that requires the dancer to maintain rotation while overcoming friction.\n2. The dancer uses a combination of movements, including pausing, twisting, and extending her leg, to generate new torque and maintain momentum.\n3. The extended arms and torque-generating foot help drive the fouetté.\n4. The dancer's center of gravity must remain constant, and the turning axis must be vertical, for the turns to be effective.\n5. The concept of angular momentum and conservation of angular momentum governs the fouetté.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. The principles of angular momentum and conservation of angular momentum can be applied to other rotating systems, such as ice skating.\n2. Understanding the physics behind the fouetté can help dancers improve their technique and performance.\n3. The concept of storing momentum in a moving leg can be applied to other physical activities, such as gymnastics or figure skating.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between the dancer's movements and the generation of torque and momentum.\n2. The contrast between the dancer's center of gravity and the turning axis, and how they affect the fouetté.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the dancer's arm and leg movements and the maintenance of momentum.\n4. The comparison between the fouetté and other rotating systems, such as ice skating.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining the concepts of angular momentum and conservation of angular momentum to understand the fouetté.\n2. Integrating the principles of physics with the art of ballet to improve performance and technique.\n3. Applying the concept of storing momentum in a moving leg to other physical activities.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Judging the effectiveness of a dancer's fouetté based on their ability to maintain momentum and rotation.\n2. Critiquing the technique of a dancer performing the fouetté, taking into account the principles of physics and angular momentum.\n3. Justifying the use of the fouetté in ballet, considering its artistic and technical value.\n4. Evaluating the importance of understanding the physics behind the fouetté for dancers and choreographers."
