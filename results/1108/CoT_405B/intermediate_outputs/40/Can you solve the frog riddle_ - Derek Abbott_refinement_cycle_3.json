    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) In the given scenario, what is the source of the antidote to the poisonous mushroom?\n    - A: A certain species of male frog\n    - B: A certain species of female frog\n    - C: A certain species of plant\n    - D: A certain species of snake\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What mathematical concept is used to calculate the odds of survival in the given scenario?\n    - A: Independent probability\n    - B: Conditional probability\n    - C: Mutual exclusivity\n    - D: Bayes' theorem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the main idea behind the concept of conditional probability?\n    - A: It involves calculating the probability of an event without considering new information.\n    - B: It involves updating the probability of an event based on new information.\n    - C: It involves assuming a fixed probability for all events.\n    - D: It involves ignoring the sample space.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the sample space as new information becomes available in conditional probability?\n    - A: It increases\n    - B: It decreases\n    - C: It remains the same\n    - D: It becomes irrelevant\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How is conditional probability applied in computer error detection?\n    - A: To identify likely errors in data\n    - B: To ignore errors in data\n    - C: To assume a fixed probability of errors\n    - D: To calculate the probability of errors without considering new information\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) In what way can conditional probability be applied to life decisions?\n    - A: By ignoring past experiences and surroundings\n    - B: By using past experiences and surroundings to make informed choices\n    - C: By assuming a fixed probability for all outcomes\n    - D: By calculating the probability of outcomes without considering new information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the male frog's croak affect the probability of the female frog's presence?\n    - A: It decreases the probability of the female frog's presence.\n    - B: It increases the probability of the female frog's presence by eliminating the possibility of two females.\n    - C: It has no effect on the probability of the female frog's presence.\n    - D: It guarantees the presence of a female frog.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between the initial 50% probability and the updated 67% probability in the given scenario?\n    - A: The updated probability is lower than the initial probability.\n    - B: The updated probability is the same as the initial probability.\n    - C: The updated probability is higher than the initial probability due to the elimination of possibilities.\n    - D: The updated probability is irrelevant to the initial probability.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can conditional probability be combined with other mathematical concepts?\n    - A: By using Bayes' theorem to update probabilities based on new information\n    - B: By ignoring other mathematical concepts\n    - C: By assuming a fixed probability for all events\n    - D: By calculating the probability of events without considering new information\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the probability of survival if the protagonist goes to the clearing and licks both frogs?\n    - A: 25%\n    - B: 50%\n    - C: 67%\n    - D: 75%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is required to evaluate the protagonist's decision to go to the clearing or the tree stump?\n    - A: Ignoring the probability of survival\n    - B: Calculating the probability of survival without considering new information\n    - C: Evaluating the probability of survival based on the available information and conditional probability\n    - D: Assuming a fixed probability of survival\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the flaw in the two incorrect solutions (50% and 75%) in the given scenario?\n    - A: They consider conditional probability\n    - B: They ignore or misapply conditional probability\n    - C: They assume a fixed probability for all events\n    - D: They calculate the probability of events without considering new information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-9 and 11-12. However, I added a new question 10 to directly assess the understanding of the scenario's probability."
