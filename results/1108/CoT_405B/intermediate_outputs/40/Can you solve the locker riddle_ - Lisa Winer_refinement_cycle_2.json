Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many relatives, including you, are assigned to solve the puzzle in the uncle's will?\n    - A: 50\n    - B: 75\n    - C: 100\n    - D: 125\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What type of numbers have only two distinct factors: 1 and themselves?\n    - A: Perfect squares\n    - B: Prime numbers\n    - C: Composite numbers\n    - D: Even numbers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary purpose of the puzzle created by the uncle in his will?\n    - A: To ensure the inheritance goes to the relative who can solve it first\n    - B: To distribute the inheritance evenly among all relatives\n    - C: To test the relatives' knowledge of prime numbers\n    - D: To create a challenging math problem\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What determines whether a locker will remain open or closed in the puzzle?\n    - A: The number of relatives assigned to it\n    - B: The number of factors in the locker number\n    - C: The position of the locker in the row\n    - D: The word written on the locker\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which field can benefit from the concept of factors and prime numbers used in the puzzle?\n    - A: Biology\n    - B: Cryptography\n    - C: Economics\n    - D: Geography\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential application of using puzzles like the one in the uncle's will?\n    - A: Improving memory recall\n    - B: Enhancing problem-solving skills\n    - C: Developing critical thinking\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of factors in a locker number and the number of times it is touched?\n    - A: Directly proportional\n    - B: Inversely proportional\n    - C: The same\n    - D: Unrelated\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between lockers with an odd number of factors and those with an even number of factors?\n    - A: Odd factors are prime, while even factors are composite\n    - B: Odd factors are perfect squares, while even factors are not\n    - C: Odd factors are closed, while even factors are open\n    - D: Odd factors are open, while even factors are closed\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How can the concept of factors and prime numbers be used to solve the puzzle?\n    - A: By identifying the prime numbers and eliminating them\n    - B: By finding the perfect squares and focusing on them\n    - C: By using the fact that perfect squares have an odd number of factors to identify the open lockers\n    - D: By using trial and error to find the solution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential outcome of applying the idea of using puzzles to solve problems in real-world scenarios?\n    - A: Improved critical thinking skills\n    - B: Enhanced problem-solving abilities\n    - C: Increased creativity\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What can be said about the effectiveness of the puzzle in achieving the uncle's goal?\n    - A: It is an inefficient way to determine the inheritance\n    - B: It is a clever way to test the relatives' problem-solving skills\n    - C: It is a fair way to distribute the inheritance\n    - D: It is a complex way to hide the safe's combination\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What justification can be given for using puzzles as a means of problem-solving and critical thinking?\n    - A: Puzzles are an entertaining way to pass the time\n    - B: Puzzles improve memory recall and cognitive function\n    - C: Puzzles promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills\n    - D: Puzzles are a waste of time and resources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefinements made:\n\n- Ensured each question aligns with the key concepts in the transcript.\n- Enhanced clarity and conciseness of the questions.\n- Confirmed distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n- Ensured correct answers are accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
