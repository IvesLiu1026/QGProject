    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**:\n\n1. Light can be thought of as a wave.\n2. Waves have a repetitive or periodic motion.\n3. The time it takes for a wave to go through its full range of motion once is called the period.\n4. The frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a given point in one second.\n5. The frequency of light is related to its color.\n6. The visible spectrum is a continuous band of color.\n7. The lowest frequency light that humans can see is red, and the highest frequency is purple.\n8. Objects reflect certain colors of light and absorb others.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. Understanding the concept of waves and how they relate to light and color.\n2. Recognizing that the frequency of light is too high to be observed directly.\n3. Comprehending how objects reflect and absorb different colors of light.\n4. Understanding the relationship between the color of an object and the light it reflects.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. Using the concept of waves to explain how light behaves.\n2. Applying the idea of frequency to understand how light is perceived as color.\n3. Using the knowledge of how objects reflect and absorb light to explain why certain objects appear certain colors.\n4. Relating the concept of light and color to real-world situations, such as why it's uncomfortable to wear dark clothing on a sunny day.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. Identifying the relationship between the period and frequency of a wave.\n2. Recognizing the cause-and-effect connection between the frequency of light and its perceived color.\n3. Analyzing how objects interact with different colors of light to produce their apparent color.\n4. Comparing and contrasting the behavior of light with other types of waves.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining the concepts of waves, frequency, and light to understand the phenomenon of color.\n2. Integrating the knowledge of how objects reflect and absorb light to explain the appearance of different colors.\n3. Using the understanding of light and color to make predictions about how objects will appear under different lighting conditions.\n4. Generating new ideas about how to manipulate light and color to create specific effects.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. Judging the validity of the statement that color is a measure of the frequency of light.\n2. Evaluating the effectiveness of using the concept of waves to explain the behavior of light.\n3. Critiquing the idea that objects reflect and absorb light in a way that produces their apparent color.\n4. Justifying the claim that the visible spectrum is a continuous band of color."
