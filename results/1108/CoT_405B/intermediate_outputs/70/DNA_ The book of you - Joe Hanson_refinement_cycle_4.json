    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many cells are in the human body?\n    - A: 1 trillion\n    - B: 10 trillion\n    - C: 100 trillion\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the primary function of the human genome?\n    - A: To provide energy for the body\n    - B: To guide the development and function of a human being\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To produce hormones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) How many chromosomes does the human genome consist of?\n    - A: 23\n    - B: 46\n    - C: 92\n    - D: 184\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the role of nucleosomes in DNA packaging?\n    - A: To unwind DNA\n    - B: To condense DNA into a small compartment by wrapping it around proteins\n    - C: To replicate DNA\n    - D: To transcribe DNA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What makes each person different?\n    - A: The number of cells in their body\n    - B: The unique combination of genetic instructions in their genome\n    - C: Their environmental influences\n    - D: The tiny variations in their genome\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to: \n5) What primarily makes each person different?\n    - A: The number of cells in their body\n    - B: The unique combination of genetic instructions in their genome\n    - C: Their environmental influences\n    - D: The tiny variations in their genome\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) How is the vast amount of genetic information in the human genome organized?\n    - A: It is organized into a single, long thread\n    - B: It is organized into a compact, spiral structure through the wrapping of DNA around proteins and the layering of spirals\n    - C: It is organized into a series of small, separate units\n    - D: It is not organized in any particular way\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between the size of the nucleus and the amount of genetic information it contains?\n    - A: The nucleus is large and contains little genetic information\n    - B: The nucleus is small and contains a vast amount of genetic information\n    - C: The nucleus is large and contains a vast amount of genetic information\n    - D: The nucleus is small and contains a moderate amount of genetic information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) How do cells differentiate and specialize in the human body?\n    - A: Through a process of random chance\n    - B: Through a process of genetic mutation\n    - C: By reading specific sets of genetic instructions, or bookmarks, that tell them which pages to look up\n    - D: Through a process of environmental influence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is the estimated number of individual instructions, or genes, in the human genome?\n    - A: 10,000\n    - B: 20,000\n    - C: 30,000\n    - D: 40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is the purpose of the excess pages, or introns, in the human genome?\n    - A: To provide additional genetic instructions\n    - B: To protect the ends of each chapter from being damaged\n    - C: To help cells find specific genetic information\n    - D: All of the above, including protecting the ends of each chapter, helping cells find specific genetic information, and giving cells a signal to stop making something\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) How long would it take to type out the entire human genome, assuming one letter per second?\n    - A: Almost a year\n    - B: Over 10 years\n    - C: Over 100 years\n    - D: Over 1,000 years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is the approximate total number of letters in the human genome?\n    - A: 3.2 million\n    - B: 3.2 billion\n    - C: 30 million\n    - D: 30 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
