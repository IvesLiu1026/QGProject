    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many cells are in the human body?\n    - A: 1 trillion\n    - B: 10 trillion\n    - C: 100 trillion\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many chromosomes does the human genome consist of?\n    - A: 23\n    - B: 46\n    - C: 92\n    - D: 184\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the human genome?\n    - A: To provide energy for the body\n    - B: To guide the development and function of a human being\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To produce hormones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the role of nucleosomes in DNA packaging?\n    - A: To unwind DNA\n    - B: To condense DNA into a small compartment\n    - C: To replicate DNA\n    - D: To transcribe DNA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the significance of the unique combination of genetic instructions in each individual?\n    - A: It determines eye color\n    - B: It determines height\n    - C: It makes each person different\n    - D: It determines skin color\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How is the vast amount of genetic information in the human genome organized?\n    - A: It is organized into a single, long thread\n    - B: It is organized into a compact, spiral structure\n    - C: It is organized into a series of small, separate units\n    - D: It is not organized in any particular way\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of cells in the human body and the complexity of the human genome?\n    - A: The more cells, the simpler the genome\n    - B: The more cells, the more complex the genome\n    - C: The number of cells has no impact on genome complexity\n    - D: The genome complexity is independent of cell number\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the contrast between the compact size of the nucleus and the vast amount of genetic information it contains?\n    - A: The nucleus is large and contains little genetic information\n    - B: The nucleus is small and contains a vast amount of genetic information\n    - C: The nucleus is large and contains a vast amount of genetic information\n    - D: The nucleus is small and contains little genetic information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How do cells differentiate and specialize in the human body?\n    - A: Through a process of random chance\n    - B: Through a process of genetic mutation\n    - C: By reading specific sets of genetic instructions\n    - D: Through a process of environmental influence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the result of combining the ideas of genetic variation and environmental influences on the development of complex traits and diseases?\n    - A: A complete understanding of the causes of all diseases\n    - B: A personalized treatment plan for every individual\n    - C: A better understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors\n    - D: A single cure for all diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the significance of the human genome project, and how has it impacted our understanding of human biology?\n    - A: It has had little impact on our understanding of human biology\n    - B: It has greatly advanced our understanding of human biology and improved medical treatments\n    - C: It has only benefited the field of genetics\n    - D: It has led to more questions than answers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential critique of the idea that the human genome is a \"book of instructions\"?\n    - A: It oversimplifies the complexity of the human genome\n    - B: It is too complicated for the general public to understand\n    - C: It is only applicable to humans\n    - D: It is not supported by scientific evidence\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI have made some changes to the questions to improve their clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I have also rephrased some of the questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
