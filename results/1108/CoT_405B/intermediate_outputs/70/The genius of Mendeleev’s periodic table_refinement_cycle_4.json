Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is credited with creating the periodic table, which predicted the existence of undiscovered elements?\n    - A: Antoine Lavoisier\n    - B: Joseph Priestley\n    - C: Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran\n    - D: Dmitri Mendeleev\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the atomic weight of the element gallium, which was predicted by Mendeleev and later discovered by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran?\n    - A: 65.12\n    - B: 68.00\n    - C: 69.72\n    - D: 75.56\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the significance of the periodic table in the field of science, as demonstrated by Mendeleev's work?\n    - A: It is a list of elements in alphabetical order.\n    - B: It is a tool for understanding the relationships between elements and predicting their properties.\n    - C: It is a historical document.\n    - D: It is a symbol of the scientific community.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was the basis of Mendeleev's predictions about undiscovered elements, such as gallium and technetium?\n    - A: His analysis of astronomical data.\n    - B: His collaboration with other scientists.\n    - C: His understanding of the elements surrounding the blank spots in the table.\n    - D: His knowledge of chemistry and physics.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How did Mendeleev predict the properties of undiscovered elements, such as their atomic weights and melting points?\n    - A: He used a mathematical formula.\n    - B: He consulted with other scientists.\n    - C: He used his intuition and luck.\n    - D: He analyzed the relationships between elements, including their atomic weights and properties.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What was the outcome of Mendeleev's prediction about the element gallium, which was later discovered by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran?\n    - A: His prediction was proven incorrect.\n    - B: His prediction was partially correct.\n    - C: His prediction was inconclusive.\n    - D: His prediction was proven correct, with gallium's properties matching Mendeleev's predictions.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the significance of the element Mendelevium, which was named after Dmitri Mendeleev?\n    - A: It is a naturally occurring element.\n    - B: It is a radioactive element.\n    - C: It is an element named after Dmitri Mendeleev in recognition of his contributions to chemistry.\n    - D: It is a synthetic element with no significance.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How did Mendeleev's work on the periodic table impact the field of chemistry, particularly in the discovery of new elements?\n    - A: It led to a decrease in scientific research.\n    - B: It had no impact on the field of chemistry.\n    - C: It built a foundation for the discovery of new elements and the development of new technologies.\n    - D: It only led to the discovery of a few new elements.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) Why is Mendeleev considered a science hall-of-famer, and what is his legacy in the field of chemistry?\n    - A: Because of his luck and intuition.\n    - B: Because of his collaboration with other scientists.\n    - C: Because of the accuracy of his predictions and the impact of his work on the field of chemistry.\n    - D: Because of his knowledge of chemistry and physics.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the legacy of Mendeleev's work on the periodic table, and how has it influenced the development of chemistry?\n    - A: A list of elements in alphabetical order.\n    - B: A piece of art.\n    - C: A foundation for the discovery of new elements and the development of new technologies.\n    - D: A tool for understanding the relationships between elements.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
