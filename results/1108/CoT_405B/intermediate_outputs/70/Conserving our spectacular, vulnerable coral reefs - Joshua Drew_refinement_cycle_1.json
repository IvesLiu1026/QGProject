    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of ecosystem is particularly vulnerable, according to marine conservation biologists?\n    - A: Mangrove forests\n    - B: Coral reefs\n    - C: Sea-grass beds\n    - D: Kelp forests\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Where is Fiji located?\n    - A: North Pacific Ocean\n    - B: South Pacific Ocean\n    - C: Indian Ocean\n    - D: Atlantic Ocean\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the main goal of marine conservation biologists working in Fiji?\n    - A: To create a single large protected area\n    - B: To balance conservation needs with the needs of people who rely on reefs for survival\n    - C: To study the migration of species among reserves\n    - D: To protect only coral reefs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option D more specific and incorrect.\n\n4) What is the idea behind the string-of-pearls reserve network in Fiji?\n    - A: To create a single large protected area\n    - B: To protect only coral reefs\n    - C: To create a network of protected areas to protect different habitats and species\n    - D: To focus on land-based conservation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make option D more distinct and incorrect.\n\n5) Where else can the concept of connectivity be applied, according to the lessons learned from Fiji's conservation efforts?\n    - A: Only in the South Pacific Ocean\n    - B: In other locations around the world, such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Bahamas\n    - C: Only in coral reef ecosystems\n    - D: Only in developed countries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) How can scientists use genetics and DNA to inform conservation efforts?\n    - A: By studying the migration of species among reserves\n    - B: By analyzing water quality\n    - C: By monitoring ocean temperatures\n    - D: By tracking human impact on reefs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make options B, C, and D more specific and incorrect.\n\n7) What is the relationship between conservation and the needs of people who rely on reefs for survival?\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and requiring a balanced approach\n    - C: Only relevant in coral reef ecosystems\n    - D: Irrelevant to conservation efforts\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option D more distinct and incorrect.\n\n8) Why is the migration of species among reserves important to study?\n    - A: To create a single large protected area\n    - B: To understand the impact of climate change\n    - C: To inform conservation efforts and ensure effective protection of species\n    - D: To monitor water quality\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make options B and D more specific and incorrect.\n\n9) How can the concept of connectivity be combined with genetics and DNA research to create a more effective conservation strategy?\n    - A: By creating a single large protected area\n    - B: By studying the migration of species among reserves and using that information to inform conservation efforts\n    - C: By analyzing water quality\n    - D: By monitoring ocean temperatures\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make options C and D more specific and incorrect.\n\n10) What can be combined with community engagement and education to create a more sustainable conservation effort?\n    - A: The creation of a single large protected area\n    - B: The creation of multiple small parks connected through a network\n    - C: The study of the migration of species among reserves\n    - D: The enforcement of strict regulations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option B more specific and correct.\n\n11) How can the effectiveness of the string-of-pearls reserve network in Fiji be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its ability to protect only coral reefs\n    - B: Based on its ability to protect different habitats and species\n    - C: Based on its economic cost\n    - D: Based on its impact on local communities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option D more specific and incorrect.\n\n12) What is one way to evaluate the use of genetics and DNA to study the migration of species among reserves?\n    - A: Based on its accuracy and relevance to conservation efforts\n    - B: Based on its economic cost\n    - C: Based on its popularity among local communities\n    - D: Based on its ability to protect only coral reefs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed."
