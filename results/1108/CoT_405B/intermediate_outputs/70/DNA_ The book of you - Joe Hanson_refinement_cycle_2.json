    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many cells are in the human body?\n    - A: 1 trillion\n    - B: 10 trillion\n    - C: 100 trillion\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of the human genome?\n    - A: To provide energy for the body\n    - B: To guide the development and function of a human being\n    - C: To regulate body temperature\n    - D: To produce hormones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How many chromosomes does the human genome consist of?\n    - A: 23\n    - B: 46\n    - C: 92\n    - D: 184\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the role of nucleosomes in DNA packaging?\n    - A: To unwind DNA\n    - B: To condense DNA into a small compartment\n    - C: To replicate DNA\n    - D: To transcribe DNA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What makes each person different?\n    - A: The number of cells in their body\n    - B: The unique combination of genetic instructions in their genome\n    - C: Their environmental influences\n    - D: Their diet and lifestyle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How is the vast amount of genetic information in the human genome organized?\n    - A: It is organized into a single, long thread\n    - B: It is organized into a compact, spiral structure\n    - C: It is organized into a series of small, separate units\n    - D: It is not organized in any particular way\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the size of the nucleus and the amount of genetic information it contains?\n    - A: The nucleus is large and contains little genetic information\n    - B: The nucleus is small and contains a vast amount of genetic information\n    - C: The nucleus is large and contains a vast amount of genetic information\n    - D: The nucleus is small and contains little genetic information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How do cells differentiate and specialize in the human body?\n    - A: Through a process of random chance\n    - B: Through a process of genetic mutation\n    - C: By reading specific sets of genetic instructions\n    - D: Through a process of environmental influence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the estimated number of individual instructions, or genes, in the human genome?\n    - A: 10,000\n    - B: 20,000\n    - C: 30,000\n    - D: 40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the purpose of the excess pages, or introns, in the human genome?\n    - A: To provide additional genetic instructions\n    - B: To protect the ends of each chapter from being damaged\n    - C: To help cells find specific genetic information\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) How long would it take to type out the entire human genome, assuming one letter per second?\n    - A: Almost a year\n    - B: Over 10 years\n    - C: Over 100 years\n    - D: Over 1,000 years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the approximate total number of letters in the human genome?\n    - A: 3.2 million\n    - B: 3.2 billion\n    - C: 30 million\n    - D: 30 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 10 and 11 from the initial set as they were not directly supported by the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. Additionally, I changed the distractors for some questions to make them more plausible but incorrect."
