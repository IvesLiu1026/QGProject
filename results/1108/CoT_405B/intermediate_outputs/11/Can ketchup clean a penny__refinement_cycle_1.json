    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary metal component of pennies?\n    - A: Zinc\n    - B: Copper\n    - C: Iron\n    - D: Aluminum\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of substances can dissolve copper oxide, making pennies shiny again?\n    - A: Basic substances\n    - B: Neutral substances\n    - C: Acidic substances\n    - D: Alkaline substances\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What was the primary goal of the experiment with the dull pennies?\n    - A: To test the strength of different substances\n    - B: To find the best way to clean dull pennies\n    - C: To analyze the properties of copper\n    - D: To compare the acidity of different substances\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why did the pennies cleaned with acidic substances, like lemon juice or vinegar, become shiny?\n    - A: Because the acidic substances added a new layer to the pennies\n    - B: Because the acidic substances dissolved the copper oxide coating\n    - C: Because the acidic substances changed the color of the pennies\n    - D: Because the acidic substances made the pennies heavier\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which of the following substances could be used to replicate the experiment at home to clean dull pennies?\n    - A: Juice (e.g., lemon, orange, or grapefruit)\n    - B: Water\n    - C: Oil\n    - D: Honey\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a real-life application of understanding acidity, as demonstrated in the experiment?\n    - A: Understanding why certain foods are good for your skin\n    - B: Understanding why certain foods or drinks can be harmful to teeth\n    - C: Understanding why certain foods are high in calories\n    - D: Understanding why certain foods are low in fat\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the acidity of a substance and its ability to clean copper pennies?\n    - A: The more acidic the substance, the less effective it is at cleaning copper pennies\n    - B: The more acidic the substance, the more effective it is at cleaning copper pennies\n    - C: The acidity of a substance has no effect on its ability to clean copper pennies\n    - D: The less acidic the substance, the more effective it is at cleaning copper pennies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the use of acidic substances and the removal of copper oxide from pennies?\n    - A: The acidic substances add a new layer to the pennies, causing the copper oxide to be removed\n    - B: The acidic substances dissolve the copper oxide coating, revealing the shiny copper underneath\n    - C: The acidic substances change the color of the pennies, causing the copper oxide to be removed\n    - D: The acidic substances make the pennies heavier, causing the copper oxide to be removed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What concepts are combined in the experiment to form a new understanding of how to clean pennies?\n    - A: Chemistry and physics\n    - B: Chemistry and materials science\n    - C: Biology and chemistry\n    - D: Physics and materials science\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What could be a potential new experiment or application based on the results of the experiment with dull pennies?\n    - A: Using acidic substances to clean other types of metals\n    - B: Using basic substances to clean copper pennies\n    - C: Using neutral substances to clean copper pennies\n    - D: Using acidic substances to react with other materials\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is required to determine which substances are most effective at cleaning pennies?\n    - A: Critical thinking and evaluation of the results\n    - B: Random guessing and trial-and-error\n    - C: Following a set of instructions\n    - D: Using a specific formula\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is necessary to explain the results of the experiment with dull pennies?\n    - A: An evaluation of the chemical properties of the substances used and their interactions with the copper pennies\n    - B: A summary of the experiment's procedure\n    - C: A list of the materials used\n    - D: A description of the experiment's results\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
