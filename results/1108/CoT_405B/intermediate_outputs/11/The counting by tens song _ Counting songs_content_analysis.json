Knowledge**\n- Counting by tens starts with the number 10.\n- To count by tens, jump 10 numbers at a time.\n- A helpful hint is to count up by ones and add a zero.\n- Examples of counting by tens include: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.\n\n**2. Comprehension**\n- The concept of counting by tens involves increasing a number by 10 each time.\n- The pattern of counting by tens can be continued beyond 100.\n- Counting by tens can be practiced through repetition and song.\n\n**3. Application**\n- Real-world scenarios where counting by tens is useful include:\n  - Measuring lengths or distances in multiples of 10 (e.g., 10 meters, 20 meters, etc.).\n  - Counting money in denominations of 10 (e.g., $10, $20, etc.).\n  - Organizing objects into groups of 10 for easier counting.\n\n**4. Analysis**\n- The relationship between counting by ones and counting by tens is that adding a zero to a single-digit number is equivalent to multiplying it by 10.\n- The pattern of counting by tens is a simple addition of 10 to the previous number.\n- The contrast between counting by ones and counting by tens is the increment value (1 vs. 10).\n\n**5. Synthesis**\n- Combining the concept of counting by tens with other math operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) can help with mental math calculations.\n- Using counting by tens to estimate quantities or measurements can be a useful strategy in problem-solving.\n- Creating songs or rhymes to help remember counting patterns, like counting by tens, can be an effective learning tool.\n\n**6. Evaluation**\n- Evaluating the effectiveness of using songs or rhymes to teach counting by tens.\n- Justifying the importance of practicing counting by tens in real-world scenarios.\n- Critiquing the usefulness of the \"count up by ones and add a zero\" hint for students who struggle with counting by tens."
