    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the primary characteristic that determines the name of a polygon?\n    - A: The number of internal angles\n    - B: The length of its sides\n    - C: The number of sides\n    - D: The shape's color\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which type of polygon has 7 angles and 7 sides?\n    - A: Heptagon\n    - B: Octagon\n    - C: Nonagon\n    - D: Decagon\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the relationship between the number of sides and the number of angles in a polygon?\n    - A: The number of sides is always one more than the number of angles\n    - B: The number of sides is always equal to the number of angles\n    - C: The number of sides is always one less than the number of angles\n    - D: There is no relationship between the number of sides and angles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary way to identify the type of polygon?\n    - A: By its color\n    - B: By its size\n    - C: By the number of sides\n    - D: By the length of its sides\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n1) An architect is designing a building with a polygon-shaped foundation. If the foundation has 6 sides, what type of polygon is it?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Quadrilateral\n    - C: Hexagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) An artist wants to create a polygon with 5 sides in a drawing. What type of polygon should the artist draw?\n    - A: Pentagon\n    - B: Hexagon\n    - C: Heptagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between the number of sides and the internal angles of a polygon?\n    - A: As the number of sides increases, the internal angles decrease\n    - B: As the number of sides increases, the internal angles increase\n    - C: As the number of sides increases, the internal angles remain the same\n    - D: There is no relationship between the number of sides and internal angles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can be observed when comparing the characteristics of different types of polygons?\n    - A: The number of sides decreases as the number of angles increases\n    - B: The number of sides increases as the number of angles decreases\n    - C: The number of sides and angles are always equal\n    - D: The number of sides and angles are never equal\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What type of polygon can be created by combining two triangles?\n    - A: Quadrilateral\n    - B: Pentagon\n    - C: Hexagon\n    - D: Heptagon\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What would be a possible name for a polygon with 11 sides?\n    - A: Hendecagon\n    - B: Dodecagon\n    - C: Tridecagon\n    - D: Tetradecagon\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Is a polygon with 8 sides accurately named an octagon?\n    - A: Yes, because it has 7 sides\n    - B: Yes, because it has 8 sides\n    - C: No, because it has 7 sides\n    - D: No, because it has 9 sides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which polygon would be the most suitable choice for designing a stop sign?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Quadrilateral\n    - C: Pentagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: D"
