Knowledge**\n\n- Primary colors: yellow, blue, and red\n- Secondary colors: orange (red + yellow), purple (red + blue), and green (blue + yellow)\n- Tertiary colors: red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-purple, and red-purple\n- Alternative names for tertiary colors: amber, vermilion, teal, chartreuse, violet, and magenta\n- Color schemes: Complementary, Analogous, and Monochromatic\n- Definition of Monochromatic: using one color with different values (tones, tints, and shades)\n\n**2. Comprehension**\n\n- Understanding the color wheel and how primary colors mix to form secondary colors\n- Recognizing how secondary colors mix to form tertiary colors\n- Grasping the concept of color schemes and their applications\n- Understanding the terms \"Complementary,\" \"Analogous,\" and \"Monochromatic\" in the context of color schemes\n\n**3. Application**\n\n- Using Complementary colors to create contrast (e.g., wearing red in a forest of green)\n- Applying Analogous colors to create visual harmony (e.g., combining green, teal, and blue)\n- Creating a Monochromatic color scheme by using different values of a single color\n- Designing color schemes for various purposes (e.g., art, fashion, interior design)\n\n**4. Analysis**\n\n- Identifying the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors\n- Recognizing the differences between Complementary, Analogous, and Monochromatic color schemes\n- Understanding how color schemes can be used to create contrast, harmony, or emphasis\n- Analyzing the effects of different color combinations on visual perception\n\n**5. Synthesis**\n\n- Combining color schemes to create new and unique visual effects\n- Experimenting with different values (tones, tints, and shades) to enhance a Monochromatic color scheme\n- Developing a personal style or aesthetic using color schemes\n- Creating a color palette for a specific project or brand\n\n**6. Evaluation**\n\n- Critiquing the effectiveness of different color schemes in various contexts\n- Justifying the choice of a particular color scheme for a specific purpose\n- Evaluating the impact of color schemes on emotions, mood, or atmosphere\n- Assessing the role of color schemes in creating visual hierarchy or emphasis"
