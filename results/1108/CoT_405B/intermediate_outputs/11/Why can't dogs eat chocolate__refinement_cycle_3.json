    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What molecule in chocolate is primarily responsible for making pets, such as dogs and cats, sick?\n    - A: Caffeine\n    - B: Theobromine\n    - C: Sugar\n    - D: Cocoa\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why are humans less susceptible to theobromine poisoning from chocolate compared to pets?\n    - A: Humans have a higher body weight than pets\n    - B: Humans process theobromine more slowly than pets\n    - C: Humans process theobromine more quickly than pets\n    - D: Humans have a different liver function than pets\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is a possible reason why humans evolved to be better at digesting theobromine?\n    - A: Humans have a different gut microbiome than pets\n    - B: Humans have a more efficient digestive system than pets\n    - C: Humans' ancestors ate a lot more plants than early pets did\n    - D: Humans have a stronger immune system than pets\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why are cats less likely to get poisoned from chocolate compared to dogs?\n    - A: Cats have a different metabolism than dogs\n    - B: Cats process theobromine more quickly than dogs\n    - C: Cats can't taste sweet things and are generally not interested in chocolate\n    - D: Cats have a different digestive system than dogs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) Approximately how much dark chocolate would a medium-sized dog need to eat to get a lethal dose of theobromine?\n    - A: 100 grams\n    - B: 1 kilogram\n    - C: 5 kilograms\n    - D: 8 kilograms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a characteristic of alkaloids, a class of molecules that includes theobromine?\n    - A: They are only found in animals\n    - B: They are only found in plants\n    - C: They generally contain rings with at least one nitrogen atom\n    - D: They have no physiological effects on humans and animals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinement is needed. However, minor adjustments may be made based on further feedback."
