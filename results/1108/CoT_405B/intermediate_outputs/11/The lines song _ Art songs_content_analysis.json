Knowledge:**\n- There are different types of lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, geometric, organic, gestural, zigzags, spirals).\n- Horizontal lines go from left to right or right to left.\n- Vertical lines go up and down or down and up.\n- Diagonal lines go across from low to high or high to low.\n- Lines can be longer, shorter, thick, thin, curvy, wavy, broken.\n\n**2. Comprehension:**\n- Understanding the concept of lines and their presence in the environment.\n- Recognizing the characteristics of different types of lines (e.g., horizontal lines seem calm and soothing, vertical lines are strong and stable, diagonal lines have action and movement).\n\n**3. Application:**\n- Identifying and classifying lines in real-world objects or artwork.\n- Using different types of lines to create artwork or designs.\n- Recognizing the use of lines in architecture, graphic design, or other fields.\n\n**4. Analysis:**\n- Comparing and contrasting the characteristics of different types of lines (e.g., horizontal vs. diagonal lines).\n- Identifying the emotional or aesthetic impact of different types of lines (e.g., calmness of horizontal lines, energy of diagonal lines).\n- Examining how lines are used in different contexts to convey meaning or create visual interest.\n\n**5. Synthesis:**\n- Combining different types of lines to create a new design or artwork.\n- Using lines to convey a message or tell a story.\n- Experimenting with different line styles and techniques to create a unique visual effect.\n\n**6. Evaluation:**\n- Judging the effectiveness of using different types of lines in a particular artwork or design.\n- Critiquing the use of lines in a piece of art or architecture.\n- Justifying the choice of line style or technique in a creative work.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for creating assessment questions that target different levels of cognitive thinking, from recalling facts to evaluating and justifying creative choices."
