    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What determines the name of a polygon?\n    - A: The number of internal angles\n    - B: The length of its sides\n    - C: The number of sides\n    - D: The shape's color\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which type of polygon has 7 angles and 7 sides?\n    - A: Hexagon\n    - B: Heptagon\n    - C: Octagon\n    - D: Nonagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the relationship between the number of sides and the number of angles in a polygon?\n    - A: The number of sides is always one more than the number of angles\n    - B: The number of sides is always equal to the number of angles\n    - C: The number of sides is always one less than the number of angles\n    - D: There is no relationship between the number of sides and angles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How can you identify the type of polygon?\n    - A: By its color\n    - B: By its size\n    - C: By the number of sides\n    - D: By the length of its sides\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) If a polygon has 6 sides, what type of polygon is it?\n    - A: Pentagon\n    - B: Hexagon\n    - C: Heptagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What type of polygon has 5 sides?\n    - A: Quadrilateral\n    - B: Pentagon\n    - C: Hexagon\n    - D: Heptagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What type of polygon has 8 sides?\n    - A: Heptagon\n    - B: Octagon\n    - C: Nonagon\n    - D: Decagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What type of polygon has 4 sides?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Quadrilateral\n    - C: Pentagon\n    - D: Hexagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What type of polygon has 9 sides?\n    - A: Octagon\n    - B: Nonagon\n    - C: Decagon\n    - D: Hendecagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What type of polygon has 10 sides?\n    - A: Nonagon\n    - B: Decagon\n    - C: Hendecagon\n    - D: Dodecagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Is a polygon with 8 sides accurately named an octagon?\n    - A: Yes, because it has 7 sides\n    - B: Yes, because it has 8 sides\n    - C: No, because it has 7 sides\n    - D: No, because it has 9 sides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Which polygon is commonly used for designing a stop sign?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Quadrilateral\n    - C: Pentagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nAfter reviewing the questions, I found that they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. The correct answers are also accurate. \n\nNo more refinement needed."
