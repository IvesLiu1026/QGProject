    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What determines the name of a polygon?\n    - A: The number of internal angles\n    - B: The length of its sides\n    - C: The number of sides\n    - D: The shape's color\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which type of polygon has 7 angles and 7 sides?\n    - A: Hexagon\n    - B: Heptagon\n    - C: Octagon\n    - D: Nonagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the relationship between the number of sides and the number of angles in a polygon?\n    - A: The number of sides is always one more than the number of angles\n    - B: The number of sides is always equal to the number of angles\n    - C: The number of sides is always one less than the number of angles\n    - D: There is no relationship between the number of sides and angles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How can you identify the type of polygon?\n    - A: By its color\n    - B: By its size\n    - C: By the number of sides\n    - D: By the length of its sides\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) If a polygon has 6 sides, what type of polygon is it?\n    - A: Pentagon\n    - B: Hexagon\n    - C: Heptagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What type of polygon has 5 sides?\n    - A: Quadrilateral\n    - B: Pentagon\n    - C: Hexagon\n    - D: Heptagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What type of polygon has 8 sides?\n    - A: Heptagon\n    - B: Octagon\n    - C: Nonagon\n    - D: Decagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What type of polygon has 4 sides?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Quadrilateral\n    - C: Pentagon\n    - D: Hexagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What type of polygon has 9 sides?\n    - A: Octagon\n    - B: Nonagon\n    - C: Decagon\n    - D: Hendecagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What type of polygon has 10 sides?\n    - A: Nonagon\n    - B: Decagon\n    - C: Hendecagon\n    - D: Dodecagon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Is a polygon with 8 sides accurately named an octagon?\n    - A: Yes, because it has 7 sides\n    - B: Yes, because it has 8 sides\n    - C: No, because it has 7 sides\n    - D: No, because it has 9 sides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Which polygon is commonly used for designing a stop sign?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Quadrilateral\n    - C: Pentagon\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 7 (initial) and 8 (initial) as they were similar and rephrased some questions to make them more concise. I also removed question 9 (initial) as it was not directly related to the transcript. Additionally, I added new questions 7-10 to cover more types of polygons. No further refinement is needed for the remaining questions."
