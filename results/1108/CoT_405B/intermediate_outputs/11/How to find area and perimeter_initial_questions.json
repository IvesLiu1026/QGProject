    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the unit of measurement for the area of a rectangle?\n    - A: Regular units (e.g., feet)\n    - B: Square units (e.g., square feet)\n    - C: Cubic units (e.g., cubic feet)\n    - D: Linear units (e.g., inches)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: l + w\n    - B: 2(l + w)\n    - C: l * w\n    - D: (l + w) / 2\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the purpose of the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: To find the area of the rectangle\n    - B: To find the distance around the rectangle\n    - C: To find the volume of the rectangle\n    - D: To find the length of one side of the rectangle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can you find the area of a rectangle?\n    - A: By adding the lengths of all sides\n    - B: By dividing it into squares of the same size and counting them, or using the formula length times width\n    - C: By multiplying the length and width, then adding the perimeter\n    - D: By subtracting the perimeter from the length times width\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n1) You want to build a fence around your backyard on Mars, which is shaped like a rectangle. If the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, how much fencing will you need?\n    - A: 35 feet\n    - B: 50 feet\n    - C: 70 feet\n    - D: 90 feet\n[Correct answer]: C (2(l + w) = 2(20 + 15) = 2 * 35 = 70 feet)\n\n2) You want to buy a plot of land on Mars that has a rectangular backyard with an area of 300 square feet. If the length is 20 feet, what is the width of the backyard?\n    - A: 10 feet\n    - B: 15 feet\n    - C: 20 feet\n    - D: 25 feet\n[Correct answer]: B (Area = length * width, so width = area / length = 300 / 20 = 15 feet)\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between the area and perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: The area is the distance around the rectangle, while the perimeter is the space inside\n    - B: The area is the space inside the rectangle, while the perimeter is the distance around it\n    - C: The area and perimeter are the same thing\n    - D: The area is the length times width, while the perimeter is the length plus width\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the length and width of a rectangle and its area and perimeter?\n    - A: If the length and width are known, the area and perimeter cannot be calculated\n    - B: If the length and width are known, the area can be calculated, but not the perimeter\n    - C: If the length and width are known, the perimeter can be calculated, but not the area\n    - D: If the length and width are known, the area and perimeter can be calculated\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) You want to design a backyard on Mars that has a rectangular shape and meets the needs of your dog. The dog needs at least 200 square feet of space to run around, and you want to build a fence around the backyard. What would be a suitable length and width for the backyard?\n    - A: Length = 20 feet, Width = 10 feet\n    - B: Length = 20 feet, Width = 15 feet\n    - C: Length = 15 feet, Width = 10 feet\n    - D: Length = 25 feet, Width = 20 feet\n[Correct answer]: B (Area = length * width, so length * width >= 200, and the answer choice that meets this condition and is most suitable for a backyard is B)\n\n2) You want to create a layout for your backyard on Mars that takes into account the space needed for your dog to run around and the amount of fencing required. What would be a suitable layout?\n    - A: A long, thin rectangle with a small fenced-in area\n    - B: A square shape with a large fenced-in area\n    - C: A rectangular shape with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet, and a fenced-in area of 300 square feet\n    - D: A circular shape with a small fenced-in area\n[Correct answer]: C (This answer choice takes into account the space needed for the dog to run around and the amount of fencing required, and is a suitable layout for a backyard)\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) You are considering buying a plot of land on Mars that has a rectangular backyard with an area of 300 square feet. Is this a suitable size for your dog, which needs at least 200 square feet of space to run around?\n    - A: No, the backyard is too small\n    - B: Yes, the backyard is just right\n    - C: No, the backyard is too large\n    - D: It depends on the length and width of the backyard\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) You have built a fence around your backyard on Mars, which has a rectangular shape with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet. Is the fence effective in preventing your dog from escaping?\n    - A: No, the fence is too short\n    - B: Yes, the fence is effective\n    - C: No, the fence is too long\n    - D: It depends on the height of the fence\n[Correct answer]: B (Assuming the fence is high enough to prevent the dog from jumping over, the fence is effective in preventing the dog from escaping)"
