    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What unit of measurement is used to express the area of a rectangle?\n    - A: Regular units (e.g., feet)\n    - B: Square units (e.g., square feet)\n    - C: Cubic units (e.g., cubic feet)\n    - D: Linear units (e.g., inches)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: l + w\n    - B: 2(l + w)\n    - C: l * w\n    - D: (l + w) / 2\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the purpose of calculating the perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: To find the area of the rectangle\n    - B: To find the distance around the rectangle\n    - C: To find the volume of the rectangle\n    - D: To find the length of one side of the rectangle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How can you find the area of a rectangle?\n    - A: By adding the lengths of all sides\n    - B: By dividing it into squares of the same size and counting them, or using the formula length times width\n    - C: By multiplying the length and width, then adding the perimeter\n    - D: By subtracting the perimeter from the length times width\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A rectangular backyard on Mars has a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet. How much fencing is needed to enclose the backyard?\n    - A: 35 feet\n    - B: 50 feet\n    - C: 70 feet\n    - D: 90 feet\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A rectangular backyard on Mars has an area of 300 square feet and a length of 20 feet. What is the width of the backyard?\n    - A: 10 feet\n    - B: 15 feet\n    - C: 20 feet\n    - D: 25 feet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the area and perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: The area is the distance around the rectangle, while the perimeter is the space inside\n    - B: The area is the space inside the rectangle, while the perimeter is the distance around it\n    - C: The area and perimeter are the same thing\n    - D: The area is the length times width, while the perimeter is the length plus width\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) If the length and width of a rectangle are known, what can be calculated?\n    - A: Only the area\n    - B: Only the perimeter\n    - C: Neither the area nor the perimeter\n    - D: Both the area and the perimeter\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) A dog needs at least 200 square feet of space to run around in a rectangular backyard on Mars. What would be a suitable length and width for the backyard?\n    - A: Length = 20 feet, Width = 10 feet\n    - B: Length = 20 feet, Width = 15 feet\n    - C: Length = 15 feet, Width = 10 feet\n    - D: Length = 25 feet, Width = 20 feet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What would be a suitable layout for a rectangular backyard on Mars that takes into account the space needed for a dog to run around and the amount of fencing required?\n    - A: A long, thin rectangle with a small fenced-in area\n    - B: A square shape with a large fenced-in area\n    - C: A rectangular shape with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet, and a fenced-in area of 300 square feet\n    - D: A circular shape with a small fenced-in area\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Is a rectangular backyard on Mars with an area of 300 square feet suitable for a dog that needs at least 200 square feet of space to run around?\n    - A: No, the backyard is too small\n    - B: Yes, the backyard is just right\n    - C: No, the backyard is too large\n    - D: It depends on the length and width of the backyard\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Is a fence around a rectangular backyard on Mars with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet effective in preventing a dog from escaping?\n    - A: No, the fence is too short\n    - B: Yes, the fence is effective\n    - C: No, the fence is too long\n    - D: It depends on the height of the fence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo major changes were made to the questions, but some minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers remain accurate."
