Since there were no initial questions provided, I will create a new set of questions.\n\n\n1) What is the primary function of mechanical ventilators in modern medicine?\n    - A: To cure respiratory diseases\n    - B: To assist the respiratory system in breathing\n    - C: To monitor oxygen levels in the blood\n    - D: To administer medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which Flemish physician is credited with the first description of mechanical ventilation?\n    - A: Andreas Vesalius\n    - B: Galen\n    - C: Leonardo da Vinci\n    - D: William Harvey\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What is the primary mechanism by which we breathe?\n    - A: Contracting and relaxing the diaphragm\n    - B: Expanding and contracting the lungs\n    - C: Inhaling and exhaling through the nose\n    - D: Using the trachea to pump air\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the primary difference between positive pressure ventilation and negative pressure ventilation?\n    - A: Positive pressure ventilation uses a facemask, while negative pressure ventilation uses a tube\n    - B: Positive pressure ventilation pumps air into the lungs, while negative pressure ventilation allows air to be passively drawn in\n    - C: Positive pressure ventilation is used for severe cases, while negative pressure ventilation is used for mild cases\n    - D: Positive pressure ventilation is more expensive than negative pressure ventilation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the main limitation of negative pressure ventilation devices, such as the iron lung?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They are too bulky\n    - C: They restrict patient movement and obstruct access for caregivers\n    - D: They are not effective in treating respiratory diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Why are mechanical ventilators not used as a standard treatment?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They require extensive training to operate\n    - C: They can cause long-term lung damage and require heavy sedation\n    - D: They are not effective in treating respiratory diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the main challenge in using mechanical ventilators during emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic?\n    - A: They are not effective in treating respiratory diseases\n    - B: They are too expensive\n    - C: There is a limited supply of ventilators, and they are bulky and require extensive training to operate\n    - D: They cause long-term lung damage\n[Correct answer]: C"
