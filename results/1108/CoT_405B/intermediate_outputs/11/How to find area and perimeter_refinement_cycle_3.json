Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What unit of measurement is used to express the area of a rectangle?\n    - A: Regular units (e.g., feet)\n    - B: Square units (e.g., square feet)\n    - C: Cubic units (e.g., cubic feet)\n    - D: Linear units (e.g., inches)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: l + w\n    - B: 2(l + w)\n    - C: l * w\n    - D: l + 2w\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the purpose of calculating the perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: To find the area of the rectangle\n    - B: To find the distance around the rectangle\n    - C: To find the volume of the rectangle\n    - D: To find the length of one side of the rectangle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How can you find the area of a rectangle?\n    - A: By adding the lengths of all sides\n    - B: By dividing it into squares of the same size and counting them, or using the formula length times width\n    - C: By multiplying the length and width, then adding the perimeter\n    - D: By subtracting the perimeter from the length times width\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A rectangular backyard on Mars has a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet. How much fencing is needed to enclose the backyard?\n    - A: 50 feet\n    - B: 60 feet\n    - C: 70 feet\n    - D: 80 feet\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A rectangular backyard on Mars has an area of 300 square feet and a length of 20 feet. What is the width of the backyard?\n    - A: 10 feet\n    - B: 15 feet\n    - C: 20 feet\n    - D: 25 feet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the area and perimeter of a rectangle?\n    - A: The area is the distance around the rectangle, while the perimeter is the space inside\n    - B: The area is the space inside the rectangle, while the perimeter is the distance around it\n    - C: The area and perimeter are the same thing\n    - D: The area is the length times width, while the perimeter is the length plus width\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) If the length and width of a rectangle are known, what can be calculated?\n    - A: Only the area\n    - B: Only the perimeter\n    - C: Neither the area nor the perimeter\n    - D: Both the area and the perimeter\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) A dog needs at least 200 square feet of space to run around in a rectangular backyard on Mars. What would be a suitable length and width for the backyard?\n    - A: Length = 20 feet, Width = 10 feet\n    - B: Length = 20 feet, Width = 15 feet\n    - C: Length = 10 feet, Width = 20 feet\n    - D: Length = 25 feet, Width = 8 feet\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the primary reason for calculating the perimeter of a rectangular backyard on Mars?\n    - A: To determine the area of the backyard\n    - B: To determine the distance around the backyard for fencing purposes\n    - C: To determine the volume of the backyard\n    - D: To determine the length of one side of the backyard\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
