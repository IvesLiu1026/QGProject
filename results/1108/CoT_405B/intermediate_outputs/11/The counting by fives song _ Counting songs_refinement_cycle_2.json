What is the total amount of money?\n    - A: $50\n    - B: $75\n    - C: $100\n    - D: $60\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A teacher schedules appointments at 5-minute intervals, starting at 9:00 AM. What time will the fifth appointment start?\n    - A: 9:15 AM\n    - B: 9:20 AM\n    - C: 9:25 AM\n    - D: 9:30 AM\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) (Removed as it was redundant)\n\n8) What pattern can be observed in the counting sequence?\n    - A: The numbers alternate between odd and even numbers.\n    - B: The numbers alternate between numbers ending in 0 and 5.\n    - C: The numbers are all prime numbers.\n    - D: The numbers are all multiples of 3.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) If you combine the concept of counting by 5s with addition, what would be the result of 15 + 25?\n    - A: 30\n    - B: 35\n    - C: 40\n    - D: 50\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) If you create a new counting sequence using a different increment, such as counting by 2s, what would be the next number in the sequence after 10?\n    - A: 11\n    - B: 12\n    - C: 13\n    - D: 14\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Is the counting-by-5s pattern effective in real-world scenarios, such as measuring lengths?\n    - A: No, it is not accurate.\n    - B: Yes, it is accurate and efficient.\n    - C: It depends on the specific context.\n    - D: It is only effective for counting money.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Is a hundreds chart created to represent the counting sequence a useful tool for visualization?\n    - A: No, it is not helpful.\n    - B: Yes, it is very helpful.\n    - C: It depends on the specific context.\n    - D: It is only helpful for counting by 1s.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
