Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is unique about a beaver's front teeth?\n    - A: They are very small and fragile\n    - B: They never stop growing and are reinforced with iron\n    - C: They are only used for eating plants and soft materials\n    - D: They are made of a hard, brittle material that breaks easily\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many beavers were in the US and Canada before European colonists arrived?\n    - A: 100 million\n    - B: 400 million\n    - C: 1 billion\n    - D: 500,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary reason beavers build dams?\n    - A: To create a safe place to build a home and raise their young\n    - B: To protect themselves from predators and harsh weather conditions\n    - C: To create a food source and improve water quality\n    - D: To regulate water levels and prevent flooding\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is a significant impact of the decline of beaver populations on the environment?\n    - A: Increased water quality and biodiversity\n    - B: Decreased risk of flooding and forest fires\n    - C: Habitat loss for other species and decreased ecosystem health\n    - D: Increased forest growth and vegetation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What role do beavers play in shaping their ecosystems?\n    - A: A minor role, with little impact on ecosystem health and biodiversity\n    - B: A crucial role, with significant consequences for ecosystem health and biodiversity\n    - C: Only affecting aquatic ecosystems, with no impact on terrestrial ecosystems\n    - D: Only affecting terrestrial ecosystems, with no impact on aquatic ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential effect of the recovery of beaver populations on the environment?\n    - A: Decreased water quality and biodiversity\n    - B: Increased risk of flooding and forest fires\n    - C: Improved water quality, increased biodiversity, and enhanced ecosystem health\n    - D: No impact on the environment and ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do beavers contribute to ecosystem services, such as water filtration and nutrient cycling?\n    - A: Beavers do not contribute to ecosystem services\n    - B: Beavers contribute to ecosystem services by creating dams that filter water and trap nutrients\n    - C: Beavers only contribute to water filtration, not nutrient cycling\n    - D: Beavers only contribute to nutrient cycling, not water filtration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the significance of beavers in the context of ecosystem restoration and conservation?\n    - A: Beavers are not important for ecosystem restoration and conservation\n    - B: Beavers are crucial for ecosystem restoration and conservation due to their role in shaping their ecosystems and providing ecosystem services\n    - C: Beavers are only important for aquatic ecosystem restoration, not terrestrial ecosystem restoration\n    - D: Beavers are only important for terrestrial ecosystem restoration, not aquatic ecosystem restoration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the impact of human activities on beaver populations and ecosystems be evaluated?\n    - A: In terms of their effects on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem services\n    - B: In terms of their economic benefits and costs\n    - C: In terms of their social impacts and cultural significance\n    - D: In terms of their short-term gains and immediate consequences\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts aimed at restoring beaver populations?\n    - A: The number of beavers in the area and population growth rate\n    - B: The impact on ecosystem health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services\n    - C: The cost of the conservation efforts and economic benefits\n    - D: The public perception of the conservation efforts and social acceptance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
