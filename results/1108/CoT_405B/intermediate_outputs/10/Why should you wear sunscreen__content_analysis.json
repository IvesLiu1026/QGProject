Spending more time outside can lead to more severe sunburns.\n7. Sunscreen can be a lotion, cream, or spray.\n8. Most sunscreens work by soaking up or reflecting the sun's rays.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The importance of protecting skin from the sun's rays, despite their role in supporting life on Earth.\n2. The concept of sunburns and their symptoms (redness, warmth, soreness, peeling skin).\n3. The idea that anyone can get a sunburn, regardless of skin type.\n4. The role of sunscreen in preventing sunburns and how it works.\n5. The need to reapply sunscreen regularly, especially after swimming or sweating.\n\n**Application**\n\n1.
