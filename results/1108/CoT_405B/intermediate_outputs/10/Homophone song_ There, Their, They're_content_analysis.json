Understanding the difference between \"there\", \"their\", and \"they're\" is important to avoid confusion in writing and speaking.\n2. The use of homophones can be clarified by understanding their meanings and spellings.\n\n**Application**:\n1. Using the correct homophone in sentences, such as \"I want to go there\" (place) vs. \"That's their car\" (belonging to them) vs. \"They're coming over\" (contraction of \"they are\").\n2.

Combining the understanding of homophones with other grammar rules, such as subject-verb agreement, to improve writing and speaking skills.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. Judging the effectiveness of a mnemonic device, such as the song in the transcript, in helping to remember the difference between \"there\", \"their\", and \"they're\".\n2. Critiquing a piece of writing or speech for correct use of homophones, including \"there\", \"their\", and \"they're\"."
