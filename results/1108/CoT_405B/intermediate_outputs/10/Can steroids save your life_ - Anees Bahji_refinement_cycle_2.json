    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary source from which steroids get their name?\n    - A: Fatty molecule triglyceride\n    - B: Fatty molecule cholesterol\n    - C: Protein molecule hemoglobin\n    - D: Carbohydrate molecule glucose\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the body's primary stress signal?\n    - A: Adrenaline\n    - B: Cortisol\n    - C: Insulin\n    - D: Oxytocin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What allows steroids to directly influence gene expression and protein synthesis within cells?\n    - A: Their ability to cross cell membranes and enter cells\n    - B: Their ability to bind to specific receptors on the cell surface\n    - C: Their ability to activate specific enzymes within cells\n    - D: Their ability to alter the cell's pH levels\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the primary mechanism by which medicinal corticosteroids work to treat inflammation?\n    - A: Enhancing the body's adrenaline supply\n    - B: Enhancing the body's cortisol supply\n    - C: Suppressing the body's insulin supply\n    - D: Suppressing the body's oxytocin supply\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which of the following medical conditions is often treated with corticosteroids?\n    - A: Bacterial infections\n    - B: Viral infections\n    - C: Chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus\n    - D: Heart disease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential negative effect of long-term exposure to corticosteroids?\n    - A: Increased muscle mass\n    - B: Improved immune function\n    - C: Negative psychological and physiological effects\n    - D: Enhanced cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between cortisol and the immune system?\n    - A: Cortisol enhances the immune system's ability to produce inflammation\n    - B: Cortisol suppresses the immune system's ability to produce inflammation\n    - C: Cortisol has no effect on the immune system\n    - D: Cortisol only affects the immune system in times of stress\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a key difference between the short-term and long-term effects of cortisol on the body?\n    - A: Short-term effects are detrimental, while long-term effects are beneficial\n    - B: Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects can be detrimental\n    - C: Short-term effects are neutral, while long-term effects are beneficial\n    - D: Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects are neutral\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a key insight that can be gained by recognizing the molecular structure of steroids?\n    - A: Steroids are only useful for building muscle\n    - B: Steroids have a range of beneficial effects on the body, particularly in regulating the immune system\n    - C: Steroids are only naturally occurring\n    - D: Steroids are only synthetic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be inferred about steroids based on their molecular structure?\n    - A: Steroids are only useful for building muscle\n    - B: Steroids have a range of effects on the body, including regulating the immune system\n    - C: Steroids are only naturally occurring\n    - D: Steroids are only synthetic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a key consideration when evaluating the potential risks and benefits of using corticosteroids to treat various medical conditions?\n    - A: The potential for addiction\n    - B: The potential for negative psychological and physiological effects\n    - C: The potential for increased muscle mass\n    - D: The potential for improved immune function\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) In what situations might the use of corticosteroids be justified?\n    - A: As a long-term treatment for chronic conditions\n    - B: As a short-term treatment for emergency situations, such as asthma attacks or allergic reactions\n    - C: As a preventative measure for healthy individuals\n    - D: As a treatment for non-medical purposes, such as enhancing athletic performance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 12 and 14 from the original set as they were similar to other questions, and question 13 was rephrased to question 11. I also removed question 6 from the original set as it was similar to question 5.\n\nNo more refinement needed for the remaining questions."
