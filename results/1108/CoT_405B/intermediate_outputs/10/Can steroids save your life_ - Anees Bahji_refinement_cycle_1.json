A: Cortisol enhances the immune system's ability to produce inflammation\n    - B: Cortisol suppresses the immune system's ability to produce inflammation\n    - C: Cortisol has no effect on the immune system\n    - D: Cortisol only affects the immune system in times of stress\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is a key difference between the short-term and long-term effects of cortisol on the body?\n    - A: Short-term effects are detrimental, while long-term effects are beneficial\n    - B: Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects can be detrimental\n    - C: Short-term effects are neutral, while long-term effects are beneficial\n    - D: Short-term effects are beneficial, while long-term effects are neutral\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is a key insight that can be gained by recognizing the molecular structure of steroids?\n    - A: Steroids are only useful for building muscle\n    - B: Steroids have a range of beneficial effects on the body, particularly in regulating the immune system\n    - C: Steroids are only naturally occurring\n    - D: Steroids are only synthetic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined question: \n9) What can be inferred about steroids based on their molecular structure?\n    - A: Steroids are only useful for building muscle\n    - B: Steroids have a range of effects on the body, including regulating the immune system\n    - C: Steroids are only naturally occurring\n    - D: Steroids are only synthetic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential area of research that could lead to the development of new treatments targeting the molecular structure of steroids?\n    -
