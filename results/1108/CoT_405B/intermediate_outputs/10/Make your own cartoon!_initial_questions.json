    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the primary function of a zoetrope?\n    - A: To create a static image\n    - B: To create an illusion of movement by displaying a series of drawings in rapid succession\n    - C: To create a 3D model\n    - D: To create a sculpture\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What materials are required to make a zoetrope?\n    - A: Black construction paper, white construction paper, scissors, tape, and a computer\n    - B: Black construction paper, white construction paper, scissors, tape, a ruler, two pencils, and a round piece of cardboard or a paper plate\n    - C: Paint, brushes, and a canvas\n    - D: Glue, scissors, and a piece of string\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) How does the brain contribute to the illusion of movement created by a zoetrope?\n    - A: By filling in the blanks between the frames\n    - B: By creating a new frame\n    - C: By ignoring the frames\n    - D: By reversing the order of the frames\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the importance of making small changes between each frame in a zoetrope animation?\n    - A: To create a jerky animation\n    - B: To create a smooth animation\n    - C: To create a static image\n    - D: To create a 3D model\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) You want to create a zoetrope animation of a plane taking off and landing. What should you do first?\n    - A: Start drawing the plane in mid-air\n    - B: Design and draw the sequence of frames showing the plane taking off and landing\n    - C: Build a model of the plane\n    - D: Write a story about the plane\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) You have created a zoetrope animation, but it appears jerky. What can you do to improve it?\n    - A: Increase the speed of the zoetrope\n    - B: Decrease the speed of the zoetrope\n    - C: Experiment with different speeds and techniques to create a smooth animation\n    - D: Give up and start over\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the speed of the zoetrope and the smoothness of the animation?\n    - A: The faster the zoetrope spins, the jerkier the animation will be\n    - B: The slower the zoetrope spins, the smoother the animation will be\n    - C: The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother the animation will be\n    - D: There is no relationship between the speed of the zoetrope and the smoothness of the animation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the role of the slits in a zoetrope?\n    - A: To create a static image\n    - B: To create a 3D model\n    - C: To allow the viewer to see each drawing individually\n    - D: To block the viewer's view of the drawings\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) You want to create a new type of animation that combines different techniques or styles. What can you do?\n    - A: Use a computer to create a digital animation\n    - B: Use a zoetrope to create a traditional animation\n    - C: Combine the concept of animation with the technique of creating a zoetrope to create a new understanding of how animation works\n    - D: Give up and start over\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) You want to create a new animation that tells a story or conveys a message using the zoetrope technique. What should you do first?\n    - A: Start drawing the frames\n    - B: Write a script and storyboard for the animation\n    - C: Build a model of the characters\n    - D: Create a soundtrack for the animation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is the primary advantage of using a zoetrope to create animation?\n    - A: It is expensive and time-consuming\n    - B: It is easy to use and requires minimal materials\n    - C: It creates a smooth and cohesive animation\n    - D: It is only suitable for creating simple animations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) You have created a zoetrope animation, but it appears to be lacking in creativity and originality. What can you do to improve it?\n    - A: Copy someone else's idea\n    - B: Experiment with different materials and techniques to create a unique and innovative zoetrope design\n    - C: Give up and start over\n    - D: Ask someone else to create the animation for you\n[Correct answer]: B"
