Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What physical adaptation has been observed in the tawny owl population in response to reduced snowfall in their habitat?\n    - A: A change in beak shape\n    - B: A change in plumage from pale gray to brown\n    - C: A change in eye color\n    - D: A change in wing length\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many species have been identified as having evolutionary adaptations to rapid climate change?\n    - A: 10\n    - B: 20\n    - C: 50\n    - D: 100\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is it increasingly important for humans and other species to adapt to climate change?\n    - A: Because climate change is altering ecosystems and making it difficult for species to survive\n    - B: Because climate change is having a minimal impact on ecosystems\n    - C: Because climate change is slowing down\n    - D: Because human activities are not contributing to climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What type of changes to an individual's physical traits are not heritable and have limits in responding to environmental changes?\n    - A: Genetic changes\n    - B: Plastic changes\n    - C: Evolutionary changes\n    - D: Adaptive changes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one conservation strategy to help ecosystems adapt to climate change?\n    - A: Reducing the number of protected areas\n    - B: Increasing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: Identifying and setting aside critical climate refuges\n    - D: Focusing solely on species relocation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How can humans assist mobile species in coping with climate change?\n    - A: Creating barriers to prevent migration\n    - B: Helping them move to more suitable climates\n    - C: Reducing the availability of food resources\n    - D: Increasing the number of predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and the evolution of species?\n    - A: Climate change has no impact on the evolution of species\n    - B: Climate change slows down the evolution of species\n    - C: Climate change can accelerate the evolution of species under strong selective conditions\n    - D: Climate change has a random impact on the evolution of species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between plastic changes and heritable evolutionary changes?\n    - A: Plastic changes are heritable, while evolutionary changes are not\n    - B: Plastic changes are not heritable, while evolutionary changes are\n    - C: Plastic changes are temporary, while evolutionary changes are permanent\n    - D: Plastic changes are adaptive, while evolutionary changes are not\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the potential outcome of combining human action and conservation efforts to address climate change?\n    - A: A decrease in biodiversity\n    - B: An increase in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: The preservation of much of the planet's biodiversity\n    - D: A reduction in the number of protected areas\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the outcome of integrating the ideas of adaptation, natural selection, and genetic changes?\n    - A: A decrease in the number of species adapting to climate change\n    - B: An increase in the number of species going extinct\n    - C: A better understanding of how species are responding to climate change\n    - D: A reduction in the importance of conservation efforts\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Why is it essential to continue researching and conserving species that are adapting to climate change through evolution?\n    - A: Because it is a waste of resources\n    - B: Because it is not a significant threat\n    - C: Because it can help preserve biodiversity and inform conservation efforts\n    - D: Because it is not a pressing issue\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a limitation of relying solely on evolution to address the challenges posed by climate change?\n    - A: Evolution can occur quickly enough to keep up with climate change\n    - B: Evolution can only occur in a few species\n    - C: Evolution may not be able to keep up with the rapid pace of climate change for many species\n    - D: Evolution is not an important factor in addressing climate change\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
