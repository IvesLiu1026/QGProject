Which linguistic approach would be most relevant to this lesson?\n    - A: Prescriptivism\n    - B: Descriptivism\n    - C: Linguistic universalism\n    - D: Language purism\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A researcher is studying how people from different backgrounds use language in informal settings. Which linguistic approach would be most useful for this study?\n    - A: Prescriptivism\n    - B: Descriptivism\n    - C: Linguistic universalism\n    - D: Language purism\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between prescriptivism and descriptivism in language study?\n    - A: They are mutually exclusive approaches\n    - B: They are complementary approaches that provide different insights into language use\n    - C: Prescriptivism is a subset of descriptivism\n    - D: Descriptivism is a subset of prescriptivism\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the impact of language standardization on spoken language and social status?\n    - A: It has no impact on spoken language or social status\n    - B: It can lead to a loss of regional dialects and variations\n    - C: It can lead to an increase in social status for those who use standardized language\n    - D: It can lead to a decrease in social status for those who use non-standardized language\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can integrating prescriptivism and descriptivism help to improve communication in different contexts?\n    - A: By establishing clear rules for language use\n    - B: By providing insights into how people actually use language in different contexts\n    - C: By combining knowledge of language patterns with an understanding of social context\n    - D: By focusing on language standardization\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What can be gained by synthesizing the concepts of grammar, language standardization, and descriptivism?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of language use in formal contexts\n    - B: A broader understanding of the complex nature of language\n    - C: A clearer understanding of the importance of language standardization\n    - D: A more nuanced understanding of the role of language purists in shaping language use\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is the importance of language standardization in modern communication?\n    - A: It is essential for effective communication in formal contexts\n    - B: It is necessary for communication across different regions and cultures\n    - C: It is useful but not essential for communication\n    - D: It is not necessary for communication in modern times\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can the use of descriptivism be justified in understanding language variation?\n    - A: It provides insights into how people actually use language in different contexts\n    - B: It helps to establish clear rules for language use\n    - C: It is concerned with language standardization\n    - D: It is a linguistic approach that focuses on spoken language\n[Correct answer]: A"
