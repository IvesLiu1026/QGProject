    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How did the Wright brothers decide who would be the first to fly their airplane?\n    - A: They drew straws.\n    - B: They flipped a coin.\n    - C: They played a game of chance with multiple rounds.\n    - D: They mutually agreed based on their skills.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the probability of each combination when flipping a coin just twice?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 25%\n    - C: 33.33%\n    - D: 50%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What mathematical concept is used to understand the likelihood of different combinations in coin flips?\n    - A: Statistics\n    - B: Algebra\n    - C: Probability\n    - D: Geometry\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What analogy can be used to represent the sequence of coin flips and understand the probability of different combinations?\n    - A: A card game\n    - B: A board game\n    - C: A puzzle\n    - D: A simulation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what situations can the concept of probability be applied?\n    - A: Only in games of chance\n    - B: Only in decision-making\n    - C: Only in risk assessment\n    - D: In games, decision-making, risk assessment, and other fields\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What fields can benefit from the use of algebra and mathematical modeling to solve problems?\n    - A: Only physics and engineering\n    - B: Only economics and finance\n    - C: Only computer science and biology\n    - D: Various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and finance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of flips and the probability of getting a certain combination?\n    - A: The probability increases as the number of flips decreases.\n    - B: The probability decreases as the number of flips increases.\n    - C: The probability remains the same regardless of the number of flips.\n    - D: The probability of getting a certain combination changes as the number of flips increases.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the main difference between the heads/heads and heads/tails boards that affects the average number of flips?\n    - A: The number of steps\n    - B: The probability of each combination\n    - C: The move that sends you back to the start\n    - D: The number of flips required to win\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the result of combining probability and algebra in the context of coin flips?\n    - A: The calculation of the average number of flips for each combination\n    - B: The determination of the probability of each combination\n    - C: The creation of a new game of chance\n    - D: The development of a new mathematical model\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the benefit of using the \"board game\" analogy to represent the sequence of coin flips?\n    - A: It simplifies the calculation of probability\n    - B: It helps to understand the probability of different combinations\n    - C: It increases the number of possible combinations\n    - D: It decreases the number of possible combinations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Was the Wright brothers' coin flip contest fair, and did each brother have an equal chance of winning?\n    - A: Yes, the contest was fair, and each brother had an equal chance.\n    - B: No, the contest was not fair, and Wilbur had an advantage.\n    - C: The contest was fair, but one brother had a slight advantage.\n    - D: The contest was not fair, and each brother had a different chance of winning.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Is it intuitive that each combination would have the same shot at appearing first in a string of coin flips?\n    - A: Yes, it is intuitive.\n    - B: No, it is not intuitive.\n    - C: It depends on the number of flips.\n    - D: It depends on the probability of each combination.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is the average number of flips required to get heads/heads, according to the calculation?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 4\n    - C: 6\n    - D: 8\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What is the average number of flips required to get heads/tails, according to the calculation?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 4\n    - C: 6\n    - D: 8\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12. Questions 13 and 14 were added to assess understanding of the specific calculations mentioned in the transcript."
