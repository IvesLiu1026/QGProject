    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the estimated volume of dung produced by the animal kingdom each day?\n    - A: The same volume as the water pouring over Niagara Falls\n    - B: The same volume as the water pouring over the Victoria Falls\n    - C: Half the volume of the water pouring over the Victoria Falls\n    - D: Double the volume of the water pouring over the Victoria Falls\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many known species of dung beetle are there?\n    - A: Over 5,000\n    - B: Over 6,000\n    - C: Over 7,000\n    - D: Over 8,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What role do dung beetles play in the environment?\n    - A: They contribute to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: They help to clean up excess dung\n    - C: They have no significant impact on the environment\n    - D: They only serve as a food source for other animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is one way that dung beetles contribute to agricultural systems?\n    - A: By breaking up dung and tunneling it into the soil\n    - B: By consuming seeds and preventing germination\n    - C: By spreading diseases to crops\n    - D: By reducing the need for fertilizers\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) A farmer wants to develop a more sustainable approach to managing waste in their agricultural setting. What information about dung beetles could inform their strategy?\n    - A: The number of known species of dung beetle\n    - B: The role of dung beetles in cleaning up excess dung\n    - C: The different groups of dung beetles (rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers)\n    - D: The services of dung beetles to farmers in the US and UK\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A conservationist wants to develop a plan to protect and manage habitats for dung beetles. What information about dung beetles could inform their plan?\n    - A: The relationship between dung beetles and the ecosystem\n    - B: The importance of dung beetles in seed dispersal\n    - C: The different groups of dung beetles (rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers)\n    - D: The estimated volume of dung produced by the animal kingdom each day\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between dung beetles and the ecosystem?\n    - A: Dung beetles have no significant impact on the ecosystem\n    - B: Dung beetles contribute to the degradation of the ecosystem\n    - C: Dung beetles help to maintain a balanced ecosystem\n    - D: Dung beetles are the primary cause of greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is one way that the actions of dung beetles can affect the environment?\n    - A: By reducing the need for fertilizers\n    - B: By increasing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: By breaking up dung and tunneling it into the soil, reducing the amount of methane released\n    - D: By consuming seeds and preventing germination\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How could the knowledge of dung beetles' ecological importance be combined with their role in agricultural systems to develop more sustainable farming practices?\n    - A: By reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides\n    - B: By incorporating dung beetles into agricultural systems to break up dung and tunnel it into the soil\n    - C: By increasing the use of heavy machinery to manage waste\n    - D: By ignoring the role of dung beetles in agricultural systems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How could the understanding of dung beetles' behavior be combined with conservation efforts to protect and manage habitats?\n    - A: By creating habitats that mimic the natural environment of dung beetles\n    - B: By reducing the amount of waste in agricultural settings\n    - C: By increasing the use of pesticides to control pests\n    - D: By ignoring the importance of dung beetles in ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is the justification for conserving dung beetle populations and their habitats?\n    - A: Dung beetles have no significant impact on the environment\n    - B: Dung beetles are a food source for other animals\n    - C: Dung beetles play a crucial role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem and contribute to agricultural systems\n    - D: Dung beetles are a pest species that should be controlled\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a critique of current agricultural practices in relation to the ecological importance of dung beetles?\n    - A: Current practices are effective in managing waste and promoting sustainability\n    - B: Current practices ignore the importance of dung beetles in ecosystems and contribute to environmental degradation\n    - C: Current practices are too focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: Current practices are too focused on increasing crop yields\n[Correct answer]: B"
