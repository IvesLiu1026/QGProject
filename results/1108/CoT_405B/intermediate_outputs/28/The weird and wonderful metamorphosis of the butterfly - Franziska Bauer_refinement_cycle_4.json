    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions as follows:\n\n1) What percentage of insect species undergo complete metamorphosis, a process in which the body dissolves and is rebuilt into a new form?\n    - A: 40%\n    - B: 60%\n    - C: 70%\n    - D: 85%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Which hormone is responsible for suppressing the activity of imaginal discs in a caterpillar, thereby preventing premature metamorphosis?\n    - A: Ecdysone\n    - B: Juvenile hormone\n    - C: Thyroid hormone\n    - D: Insulin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of imaginal discs in a caterpillar's development into a butterfly?\n    - A: To break down the caterpillar's body\n    - B: To form the adult butterfly's body parts\n    - C: To regulate hormone production\n    - D: To form the pupal cuticle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to the leading theory, what is the origin of the caterpillar stage in insects that undergo complete metamorphosis?\n    - A: It evolved from a life stage outside the egg\n    - B: It evolved from a life stage inside the egg\n    - C: It evolved from a life stage in the adult form\n    - D: It evolved from a life stage in the pupal form\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one potential advantage of complete metamorphosis in certain insect species, such as butterflies?\n    - A: Increased vulnerability to predators\n    - B: Decreased adaptability to changing environments\n    - C: Reduced competition for resources between larvae and adults\n    - D: Decreased reproductive success\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How do juvenile hormone and ecdysone interact to regulate a caterpillar's development into a butterfly?\n    - A: Juvenile hormone stimulates ecdysone production\n    - B: Ecdysone stimulates juvenile hormone production\n    - C: Juvenile hormone suppresses ecdysone production\n    - D: Juvenile hormone and ecdysone have a reciprocal relationship, with juvenile hormone suppressing imaginal disc activity and ecdysone triggering molting and metamorphosis\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What effect does the drop in juvenile hormone levels have on a caterpillar's development into a butterfly?\n    - A: It prevents metamorphosis\n    - B: It initiates metamorphosis\n    - C: It has no effect on metamorphosis\n    - D: It delays metamorphosis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What insights can studying complete metamorphosis provide into broader biological processes?\n    - A: Insights into development, regeneration, and transformation\n    - B: Insights into photosynthesis and respiration\n    - C: Insights into cell division and growth\n    - D: Insights into evolution and natural selection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) Why is it important to study complete metamorphosis in the context of broader biological and ecological questions?\n    - A: Because it is a simple biological process\n    - B: Because it is a complex biological process that can inform our understanding of development, transformation, and adaptation\n    - C: Because it is a unique biological process that only occurs in insects\n    - D: Because it is a well-understood biological process that requires no further study\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is one potential application of understanding the process of complete metamorphosis in insects?\n    - A: Informing strategies for pest control, conservation, and environmental management\n    - B: Understanding the process of cell division\n    - C: Understanding the process of photosynthesis\n    - D: Understanding the process of respiration\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-10."
