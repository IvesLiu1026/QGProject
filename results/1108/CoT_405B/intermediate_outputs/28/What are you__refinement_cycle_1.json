Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated number of cells in the human body?\n    - A: Billions\n    - B: Trillions\n    - C: Quadrillions\n    - D: Quintillions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the human genome is composed of viruses that once infected our ancestors?\n    - A: 2%\n    - B: 5%\n    - C: 8%\n    - D: 10%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What does the constant change and replacement of cells in the human body suggest about the concept of self and identity?\n    - A: The concept of self is fixed and unchanging.\n    - B: The concept of self is complex and can be questioned.\n    - C: The concept of self is solely defined by the physical body.\n    - D: The concept of self is only related to the brain.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the implication of the constant death and replacement of cells in the human body?\n    - A: The idea of a static self is supported.\n    - B: The idea of a static self is untenable.\n    - C: The concept of self is not affected.\n    - D: The concept of self is only related to the soul.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What potential application can arise from the fact that cells can exist without the body?\n    - A: Development of new cosmetics\n    - B: Development of new medical treatments\n    - C: Development of new food products\n    - D: Development of new exercise routines\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What field of study can benefit from the understanding of a dynamic and changing genome?\n    - A: Physics\n    - B: Chemistry\n    - C: Genetics and personalized medicine\n    - D: Environmental science\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How can the relationship between the body and its cells be described?\n    - A: Parasitic\n    - B: Symbiotic\n    - C: Antagonistic\n    - D: Neutral\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the comparison between cancer cells and normal cells highlight?\n    - A: The simplicity of the human body\n    - B: The complexity of the human body and the nature of disease\n    - C: The importance of diet and exercise\n    - D: The role of genetics in disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What new understanding can be formed by considering the human body as a self-sustaining pattern without clear borders and a dynamic genome?\n    - A: A new understanding of the nature of disease\n    - B: A new understanding of the nature of self and identity\n    - C: A new understanding of the nature of reality and perception\n    - D: A new understanding of the nature of life and death\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What new understanding can be formed by combining the concept of cells existing without the body and a dynamic genome?\n    - A: A new understanding of the nature of disease\n    - B: A new understanding of the nature of self and identity\n    - C: A new understanding of the nature of life and death\n    - D: A new understanding of the nature of reality and perception\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is required of the reader when considering the comparison between cancer cells and normal cells?\n    - A: To evaluate the moral implications of disease and the nature of life and death\n    - B: To evaluate the importance of diet and exercise\n    - C: To evaluate the role of genetics in disease\n    - D: To evaluate the simplicity of the human body\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is required of the reader when considering the concept of a dynamic genome?\n    - A: To evaluate the implications of genetic change and the nature of identity\n    - B: To evaluate the importance of diet and exercise\n    - C: To evaluate the role of genetics in disease\n    - D: To evaluate the simplicity of the human body\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefinements made:\n\n- Clarified question wording for questions 3, 5, 9, and 10.\n- Ensured distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n- Confirmed correct answers are accurate.\n- No significant changes were made to questions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12, as they were deemed clear and accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
