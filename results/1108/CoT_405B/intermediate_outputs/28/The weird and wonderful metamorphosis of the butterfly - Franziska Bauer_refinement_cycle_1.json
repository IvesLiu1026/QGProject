    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately what percentage of insect species undergo complete metamorphosis?\n    - A: 40%\n    - B: 60%\n    - C: 70%\n    - D: 85%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What hormone suppresses the activity of imaginal discs and prevents the caterpillar from beginning metamorphosis too early?\n    - A: Ecdysone\n    - B: Juvenile hormone\n    - C: Thyroid hormone\n    - D: Insulin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary role of imaginal discs in the development of a butterfly?\n    - A: To break down the caterpillar's body\n    - B: To rebuild the caterpillar's body into a butterfly\n    - C: To regulate hormone production\n    - D: To form the pupal cuticle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the leading theory about the evolution of the caterpillar stage?\n    - A: It evolved from a life stage that takes place outside the egg\n    - B: It evolved from a life stage that takes place inside the egg\n    - C: It evolved from a life stage that takes place in the adult form\n    - D: It evolved from a life stage that takes place in the pupal form\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one potential advantage of complete metamorphosis in certain species?\n    - A: Increased vulnerability to predators\n    - B: Decreased adaptability to changing environments\n    - C: Reduced competition for resources between larvae and adults\n    - D: Decreased reproductive success\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the relationship between juvenile hormone and ecdysone in regulating the caterpillar's development?\n    - A: Juvenile hormone stimulates ecdysone production\n    - B: Ecdysone stimulates juvenile hormone production\n    - C: Juvenile hormone suppresses ecdysone production\n    - D: Juvenile hormone and ecdysone have a reciprocal relationship\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect relationship between the drop in juvenile hormone levels and the initiation of metamorphosis?\n    - A: The drop in juvenile hormone levels prevents metamorphosis\n    - B: The drop in juvenile hormone levels initiates metamorphosis\n    - C: The drop in juvenile hormone levels has no effect on metamorphosis\n    - D: The drop in juvenile hormone levels delays metamorphosis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How can the study of complete metamorphosis inform our understanding of other biological processes?\n    - A: By providing insights into development and regeneration\n    - B: By providing insights into photosynthesis and respiration\n    - C: By providing insights into cell division and growth\n    - D: By providing insights into evolution and natural selection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) Why is it important to study complete metamorphosis in the context of broader biological and ecological questions?\n    - A: Because it is a simple biological process\n    - B: Because it is a complex biological process that can inform our understanding of development and transformation\n    - C: Because it is a unique biological process that only occurs in insects\n    - D: Because it is a well-understood biological process that requires no further study\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is one potential application of understanding the process of complete metamorphosis?\n    - A: Informing strategies for pest control and conservation\n    - B: Understanding the process of cell division\n    - C: Understanding the process of photosynthesis\n    - D: Understanding the process of respiration\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant and not adding any new information. I also refined the language and options to make the questions more clear and concise."
