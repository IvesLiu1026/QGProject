    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the refresh rate of a standard CRT TV in the US?\n    - A: 30 Hertz\n    - B: 60 Hertz\n    - C: 120 Hertz\n    - D: 240 Hertz\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the resolution of a 4K screen?\n    - A: 1920 by 1080 pixels\n    - B: 2560 by 1440 pixels\n    - C: 3840 by 2160 pixels\n    - D: 7680 by 4320 pixels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What creates the illusion of movement on a TV?\n    - A: Showing a single still image for an extended period\n    - B: Showing multiple still images in rapid succession\n    - C: Using a high refresh rate\n    - D: Using a low shutter speed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main difference between an LCD screen and an OLED screen?\n    - A: The resolution of the screen\n    - B: The refresh rate of the screen\n    - C: The backlighting technology used\n    - D: The size of the screen\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a limitation of LCD screens compared to OLED screens?\n    - A: They have a lower refresh rate\n    - B: They have a lower resolution\n    - C: They cannot display true black\n    - D: They are thicker and heavier\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How does the concept of persistence of vision apply to animation and film production?\n    - A: It allows for the creation of 3D images\n    - B: It enables the display of high-resolution images\n    - C: It creates the illusion of movement by displaying multiple still images in rapid succession\n    - D: It enhances the color accuracy of images\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What happens when the refresh rate of a screen is out of sync with the shutter speed of a camera?\n    - A: The image on camera appears the same as to the human eye\n    - B: The image on camera appears different from what the human eye sees\n    - C: The image on camera is distorted\n    - D: The image on camera is blurry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can be revealed by using slow-motion footage to analyze a TV image?\n    - A: The refresh rate of the screen\n    - B: The resolution of the screen\n    - C: The scan lines and pixel construction of the image\n    - D: The backlighting technology used\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is an advantage of OLED screens compared to LCD screens?\n    - A: They are cheaper to produce\n    - B: They have a higher refresh rate\n    - C: They can display true black\n    - D: They have a lower resolution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can understanding the limitations of LCD screens and the benefits of OLED screens inform the development of new display technologies?\n    - A: It can lead to the development of new LCD screens\n    - B: It can lead to the development of new OLED screens\n    - C: It can lead to the development of new display technologies that combine the benefits of LCD and OLED screens\n    - D: It can lead to the abandonment of LCD screens\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were similar to questions 5 and 9, and question 10 was rephrased to make it more concise.\n\nNo more refinement needed for the remaining questions."
