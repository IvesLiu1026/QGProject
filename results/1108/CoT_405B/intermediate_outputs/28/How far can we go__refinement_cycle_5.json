Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate age of the universe?\n    - A: 10 billion years\n    - B: 13.8 billion years\n    - C: 15 billion years\n    - D: 20 billion years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate size of the Milky Way galaxy?\n    - A: 10,000 light years across\n    - B: 50,000 light years across\n    - C: 100,000 light years across\n    - D: 200,000 light years across\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary driver of the accelerating expansion of the universe?\n    - A: Dark matter\n    - B: Dark energy\n    - C: Gravity\n    - D: Cosmic inflation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the effect of the universe's expansion on galaxy groups?\n    - A: They are moving closer together\n    - B: They are remaining stationary\n    - C: They are moving away from each other\n    - D: They are collapsing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) If humanity develops interstellar travel, what would be the primary limitation on our exploration of the universe?\n    - A: The speed of light\n    - B: The expansion of the universe\n    - C: The size of the Milky Way galaxy\n    - D: The availability of resources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the universe's expansion impact our understanding of the cosmos?\n    - A: It has no impact on our understanding\n    - B: It changes our understanding of the universe's age\n    - C: It changes our understanding of the universe's size\n    - D: It changes our understanding of our place in the universe and the universe's ultimate fate\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between dark energy and the expansion of the universe?\n    - A: Dark energy slows down the expansion\n    - B: Dark energy has no impact on the expansion\n    - C: Dark energy causes and speeds up the expansion\n    - D: Dark energy reverses the expansion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What fraction of the observable universe does the Local Group account for?\n    - A: 1%\n    - B: 0.1%\n    - C: 0.00000000001%\n    - D: 10%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What concept describes the universe as being composed of many different structures and scales?\n    - A: The multiverse theory\n    - B: The cosmic inflation theory\n    - C: The hierarchical structure of the universe\n    - D: The vastness of the universe\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the significance of existing at a time when we can see the entire universe, but will eventually be isolated from it?\n    - A: It has no significance\n    - B: It highlights the importance of exploring the universe now\n    - C: It emphasizes the need for interstellar travel\n    - D: It underscores the unique perspective we have on the universe\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is the value of exploring and understanding the universe, despite its vastness and expansion?\n    - A: It has no value\n    - B: It is essential for human survival\n    - C: It is important for understanding our place in the universe and the universe's ultimate fate\n    - D: It is a waste of resources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What will be the ultimate fate of the Local Group of galaxies?\n    - A: It will expand and disperse\n    - B: It will collapse and merge into a single galaxy\n    - C: It will remain unchanged\n    - D: It will be torn apart by dark energy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined questions 13-15:\n\n13) What is the effect of cosmic inflation on the universe's structure?\n    - A: It created a uniform universe\n    - B: It created a universe with many different structures and scales\n    - C: It had no impact on the universe's structure\n    - D: It reversed the universe's expansion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is the relationship between the universe's expansion and the distance between galaxy groups?\n    - A: The expansion causes the distance to decrease\n    - B: The expansion causes the distance to increase\n    - C: The expansion has no impact on the distance\n    - D: The distance remains constant\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What will be the eventual outcome for a being born in the far future in the merged galaxy, Milkdromeda?\n    - A: They will be able to see the entire universe\n    - B: They will be able to travel to other galaxy groups\n    - C: They will think the universe is static and eternal\n    - D: They will be able to communicate with other civilizations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-12. The additional refined questions 13-15 provide more depth and clarity on the topics covered in the transcript."
