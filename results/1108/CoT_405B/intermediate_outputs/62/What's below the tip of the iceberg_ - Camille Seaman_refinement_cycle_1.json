    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What fraction of an iceberg's volume is typically above the water?\n    - A: 1/3\n    - B: 1/9\n    - C: 1/2\n    - D: 2/3\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the official definition of a very large iceberg in terms of height and length?\n    - A: Over 200 feet high and 500 feet long\n    - B: Over 270 feet high and 670 feet long\n    - C: Over 300 feet high and 800 feet long\n    - D: Over 400 feet high and 1000 feet long\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What does the expression \"tip of the iceberg\" refer to?\n    - A: The fact that icebergs are made of fresh water\n    - B: The fact that most of an iceberg is hidden beneath the water\n    - C: The fact that icebergs can float thousands of miles\n    - D: The fact that icebergs can support complex ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the surrounding ocean ecosystem when an iceberg melts?\n    - A: It becomes more saline\n    - B: It becomes warmer\n    - C: It becomes more turbulent\n    - D: It creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical mile away\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) Why do icebergs float with most of their mass underwater?\n    - A: Because the density of ice is greater than that of sea water\n    - B: Because the density of ice is less than that of sea water\n    - C: Because the density of ice is equal to that of sea water\n    - D: Because the density of ice is not related to that of sea water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the melting of icebergs and the surrounding ocean?\n    - A: The melting of icebergs creates thermal currents in the surrounding ocean\n    - B: The melting of icebergs has no effect on the surrounding ocean\n    - C: The melting of icebergs makes the surrounding ocean more saline\n    - D: The melting of icebergs makes the surrounding ocean warmer\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do icebergs support complex ecosystems?\n    - A: By providing a source of fresh water\n    - B: By creating a habitat for a variety of marine life\n    - C: By influencing the ocean's temperature and salinity\n    - D: By affecting the ocean's currents and circulation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can be learned by combining knowledge of iceberg formation, movement, and melting?\n    - A: The role of icebergs in shaping ocean ecosystems and influencing climate change\n    - B: The complex ecosystems supported by icebergs\n    - C: The life cycle of icebergs\n    - D: The size classifications of icebergs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 9-12 as they seemed redundant or too vague. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No more refinement is needed for the remaining questions."
