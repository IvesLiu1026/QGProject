    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who proposed an earlier theory of evolution that suggested creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and passing them on to their offspring, which is now discredited?\n    - A: Charles Darwin\n    - B: Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\n    - C: Gregor Mendel\n    - D: Alfred Russel Wallace\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What term refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its current environment?\n    - A: Evolutionary adaptation\n    - B: Natural selection\n    - C: Evolutionary fitness\n    - D: Genetic mutation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What concept is often misinterpreted as implying that survival is the primary driver of evolution, when in fact reproduction plays a crucial role?\n    - A: Evolutionary adaptation\n    - B: Natural selection\n    - C: Genetic mutation\n    - D: \"Survival of the fittest\"\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What factor plays a crucial role in determining which traits are advantageous in evolution?\n    - A: The organism's genetic makeup\n    - B: The environment\n    - C: Random chance\n    - D: Human intervention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How do genetic mutations contribute to the process of evolution?\n    - A: By always leading to advantageous traits\n    - B: By occurring independently of the environment\n    - C: By providing the raw material for natural selection to act upon\n    - D: By having no impact on evolution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the relationship between genetic mutations and the environment in driving evolution?\n    - A: Genetic mutations occur independently of the environment and have no impact on evolution\n    - B: The environment determines which genetic mutations are advantageous and drive evolution\n    - C: Genetic mutations and the environment have no impact on evolution\n    - D: Genetic mutations always lead to advantageous traits and drive evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the main difference between Lamarck's theory of evolution and the current understanding?\n    - A: Lamarck's theory states that evolution occurs over many generations, while the current understanding states that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes\n    - B: Lamarck's theory states that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes, while the current understanding states that evolution occurs over many generations through genetic mutations\n    - C: Lamarck's theory states that genetic mutations play a crucial role in evolution, while the current understanding states that the environment determines which traits are advantageous\n    - D: Lamarck's theory states that the environment determines which traits are advantageous, while the current understanding states that genetic mutations play a crucial role in evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What combination of factors leads to the diversity of life on Earth?\n    - A: Genetic mutations, environmental pressures, and reproduction\n    - B: Genetic mutations, environmental pressures, and natural selection\n    - C: Reproduction, natural selection, and the environment\n    - D: Genetic mutations, reproduction, and the human eye's blind spot\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can the idea that evolution is a blind, step-by-step process be combined with our understanding of genetic mutations to appreciate the complexity of evolutionary outcomes?\n    - A: By recognizing that genetic mutations always lead to advantageous traits\n    - B: By understanding that genetic mutations occur independently of the environment\n    - C: By analyzing how genetic mutations and the environment interact to drive evolution\n    - D: By studying the human eye's blind spot\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is Lamarck's theory of evolution considered invalid in light of current understanding?\n    - A: Because it states that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes, which is not supported by scientific evidence\n    - B: Because it fails to account for the role of genetic mutations in evolution\n    - C: Because it oversimplifies the process of evolution\n    - D: Because it was proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a critique of the concept of \"survival of the fittest\" as an oversimplification of evolution?\n    - A: It fails to account for the role of genetic mutations in evolution\n    - B: It oversimplifies the process of evolution by implying that survival is the primary driver\n    - C: It was proposed by Charles Darwin\n    - D: It is not supported by scientific evidence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 12 as it was similar to question 11. I refined the remaining questions to ensure they are clear, concise, and accurate. No more refinement needed."
