The data set can be used to study the impact of historical events on human culture and behavior.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The team compared the frequency of words and phrases over time to identify patterns of cultural change.\n2. The team used the data set to identify relationships between words and phrases and their frequency over time.\n3. The team used the data set to identify patterns of censorship in Nazi Germany during World War II.\n4. The team used the data set to study the trajectory of famous people and identify patterns of success and failure.\n5. The team used the data set to study the frequency of words and phrases related to frustration and found that the less frequent words correspond to more frustrating experiences.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1.
