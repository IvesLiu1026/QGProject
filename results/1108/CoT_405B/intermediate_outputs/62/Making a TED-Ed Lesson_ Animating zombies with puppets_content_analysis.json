    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The TED-Ed Lessons used a zombie to model symptoms and medical diagnosis processes for neurological conditions.\n2. Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen are the educators who wrote and performed the TED-Ed Lessons.\n3. Puppet animation is a quick solution to creating 2-D animation of a hand-drawn character.\n4. The traditional stride of zombies is perfect for puppet-style animation.\n5. Rotoscoping was used for animating Julie Andrews in \"The Sound of Music\".\n6. A character's design should be both fun and functional in a flat environment.\n7. A skeleton (rig) is needed for a character to move realistically in its environment.\n8. Each piece of artwork has its own anchor point (hinge).\n9. Forward kinematics involves parenting one layer to another to create links between body parts.\n10. Inverse kinematics uses a separate set of scripts to control motions.\n11. Straight-ahead action and pose-to-pose animation are two approaches to animating a character.\n12. Cut-out animation is a method that can be used to create animations with a pen, paper, and a camera.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The walking dead (zombies) can be used to understand both neuroscience and animation.\n2. Puppet animation involves moving individual elements of a character to create the illusion of movement.\n3. A character's design should be sketched in a neutral pose to allow for easy transitions into and out of extreme positions.\n4. Understanding anatomy is crucial for designing animated characters that need to move realistically.\n5. A rig (skeleton) is necessary for a character to move realistically in its environment.\n6. Anchor points (hinges) are used to assign joints to a character's limbs.\n7. Forward and inverse kinematics are used to create links between body parts and control motions.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Using puppet animation to create educational videos about neurological conditions.\n2. Designing a 2-D zombie puppet for a horror movie or video game.\n3. Creating a character with a unique stride or movement pattern using puppet animation.\n4. Using cut-out animation to create a short film or commercial.\n5. Applying the principles of puppet animation to create interactive characters for a website or app.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between the zombie's stiff gait and basal ganglia damage or cerebellum damage.\n2. The contrast between puppet animation and traditional hand-drawn animation.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between a character's design and its ability to move realistically in its environment.\n4. The relationship between anchor points (hinges) and a character's joints.\n5. The contrast between forward and inverse kinematics.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Combining puppet animation with other animation techniques, such as rotoscoping or 3-D animation.\n2. Using puppet animation to create interactive characters that respond to user input.\n3. Designing a character that can be animated using both puppet animation and cut-out animation.\n4. Creating a system that allows users to create and animate their own 2-D puppets.\n5. Developing a new method of animation that combines elements of puppet animation and traditional hand-drawn animation.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of using a zombie to model symptoms and medical diagnosis processes for neurological conditions.\n2. Critiquing the design of a 2-D zombie puppet and suggesting improvements.\n3. Justifying the use of puppet animation in a particular project or scenario.\n4. Evaluating the pros and cons of using forward kinematics versus inverse kinematics.\n5. Critiquing the use of cut-out animation in a particular film or commercial."
