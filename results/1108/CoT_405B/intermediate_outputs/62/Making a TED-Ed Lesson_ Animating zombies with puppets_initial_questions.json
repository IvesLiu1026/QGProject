    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) Who are the educators who wrote and performed the TED-Ed Lessons?\n    - A: Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen\n    - B: Julie Andrews and Brad Voytek\n    - C: Tim Verstynen and Julie Andrews\n    - D: Brad Pitt and Tim Verstynen\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What animation technique was used for animating Julie Andrews in \"The Sound of Music\"?\n    - A: Puppet animation\n    - B: Rotoscoping\n    - C: Cut-out animation\n    - D: 3-D animation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the purpose of sketching a character's design in a neutral pose?\n    - A: To create a more dramatic effect\n    - B: To allow for easy transitions into and out of extreme positions\n    - C: To make the character more relatable\n    - D: To reduce the number of anchor points\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is understanding anatomy crucial for designing animated characters?\n    - A: So that they can be more colorful\n    - B: So that they can be more realistic\n    - C: So that they can move realistically in their environment\n    - D: So that they can be more exaggerated\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) You are creating an educational video about neurological conditions. Which animation technique would be most suitable for this project?\n    - A: Puppet animation\n    - B: Traditional hand-drawn animation\n    - C: 3-D animation\n    - D: Cut-out animation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) You are designing a 2-D zombie puppet for a horror movie. What should you consider when designing the character's stride or movement pattern?\n    - A: The color scheme of the movie\n    - B: The zombie's stiff gait and basal ganglia damage or cerebellum damage\n    - C: The target audience of the movie\n    - D: The budget of the movie\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between a character's design and its ability to move realistically in its environment?\n    - A: The design has no effect on the character's movement\n    - B: The design determines the character's movement pattern\n    - C: The design is influenced by the character's movement pattern\n    - D: The design and movement pattern are unrelated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between forward and inverse kinematics?\n    - A: Forward kinematics is used for 2-D animation, while inverse kinematics is used for 3-D animation\n    - B: Forward kinematics is used for creating links between body parts, while inverse kinematics is used for controlling motions\n    - C: Forward kinematics is used for realistic movements, while inverse kinematics is used for exaggerated movements\n    - D: Forward kinematics is used for puppet animation, while inverse kinematics is used for traditional hand-drawn animation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) You are creating a new animation technique that combines elements of puppet animation and traditional hand-drawn animation. What would be the benefits of this technique?\n    - A: It would be more time-consuming and expensive\n    - B: It would allow for more realistic movements and greater control over the characters\n    - C: It would be more suitable for 3-D animation\n    - D: It would be less engaging for the audience\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) You are designing a system that allows users to create and animate their own 2-D puppets. What features would you include in this system?\n    - A: A library of pre-made characters and backgrounds\n    - B: A tool for creating and editing anchor points and joints\n    - C: A feature for importing 3-D models\n    - D: A function for generating random animations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Evaluate the effectiveness of using a zombie to model symptoms and medical diagnosis processes for neurological conditions.\n    - A: It is ineffective because zombies are not realistic\n    - B: It is effective because zombies can be used to illustrate complex concepts in a engaging way\n    - C: It is ineffective because zombies are too frightening\n    - D: It is effective because zombies are a popular cultural phenomenon\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Critique the use of cut-out animation in a particular film or commercial.\n    - A: It is a good choice because it is a cost-effective and efficient technique\n    - B: It is a bad choice because it is too simplistic and lacks realism\n    - C: It is a good choice because it is a traditional and well-established technique\n    - D: It is a bad choice because it is too time-consuming and labor-intensive\n[Correct answer]: A"
