    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial questions, I've refined the questions to ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy. I've also confirmed that the distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n\n1) What fraction of an iceberg's volume is typically above the water?\n    - A: 1/3\n    - B: 1/9\n    - C: 1/2\n    - D: 2/3\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the official definition of a very large iceberg in terms of height and length?\n    - A: Over 200 feet high and 500 feet long\n    - B: Over 270 feet high and 670 feet long\n    - C: Over 300 feet high and 800 feet long\n    - D: Over 400 feet high and 1000 feet long\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What does the expression \"tip of the iceberg\" refer to?\n    - A: The fact that icebergs are made of fresh water\n    - B: The fact that most of an iceberg is hidden beneath the water\n    - C: The fact that icebergs can float thousands of miles\n    - D: The fact that icebergs can support complex ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What happens to the surrounding ocean ecosystem when an iceberg melts?\n    - A: It becomes more saline\n    - B: It becomes warmer\n    - C: It becomes more turbulent\n    - D: It creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical mile away\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined question:\n4) What effect does the melting of an iceberg have on the surrounding ocean?\n    - A: It increases the salinity of the water\n    - B: It warms the water\n    - C: It creates strong currents\n    - D: It creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical mile away\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) Why do icebergs float with most of their mass underwater?\n    - A: Because the density of ice is greater than that of sea water\n    - B: Because the density of ice is less than that of sea water\n    - C: Because the density of ice is equal to that of sea water\n    - D: Because the density of ice is not related to that of sea water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the melting of icebergs and the surrounding ocean?\n    - A: The melting of icebergs creates thermal currents in the surrounding ocean\n    - B: The melting of icebergs has no effect on the surrounding ocean\n    - C: The melting of icebergs makes the surrounding ocean more saline\n    - D: The melting of icebergs makes the surrounding ocean warmer\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question:\n6) How does the melting of an iceberg affect the surrounding ocean currents?\n    - A: It creates thermal currents\n    - B: It has no effect on the currents\n    - C: It makes the currents more turbulent\n    - D: It makes the currents slower\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do icebergs support complex ecosystems?\n    - A: By providing a source of fresh water\n    - B: By creating a habitat for a variety of marine life\n    - C: By influencing the ocean's temperature and salinity\n    - D: By affecting the ocean's currents and circulation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What can be learned by combining knowledge of iceberg formation, movement, and melting?\n    - A: The role of icebergs in shaping ocean ecosystems and influencing climate change\n    - B: The complex ecosystems supported by icebergs\n    - C: The life cycle of icebergs\n    - D: The size classifications of icebergs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question:\n8) What is the broader significance of understanding iceberg formation, movement, and melting?\n    - A: It helps us understand the role of icebergs in shaping ocean ecosystems and influencing climate change\n    - B: It helps us understand the complex ecosystems supported by icebergs\n    - C: It helps us understand the life cycle of icebergs\n    - D: It helps us understand the size classifications of icebergs\n[Correct answer]: A"
