    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) When did Bell Laboratories introduce the first commercially sold solar cell?\n    - A: 1940\n    - B: 1954\n    - C: 1960\n    - D: 1970\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What was the average consumer cost of a rooftop solar unit in the US in 2022?\n    - A: $10,000 to $15,000\n    - B: $17,000 to $23,000\n    - C: $25,000 to $30,000\n    - D: $35,000 to $40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What impact did the Renewable Energy Sources Act have on the solar energy market?\n    - A: It decreased demand for solar panels.\n    - B: It created unprecedented demand for solar panels worldwide, leading to increased production and innovation.\n    - C: It had no significant impact on the solar energy market.\n    - D: It led to a temporary increase in solar panel prices.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a key benefit of rooftop solar units?\n    - A: They increase reliance on fossil fuels.\n    - B: They reduce reliance on fossil fuels and pave the way for a cleaner energy future.\n    - C: They have no impact on the environment.\n    - D: They are only beneficial for large-scale energy production.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can governments do to drive the adoption of solar energy?\n    - A: Implement policies and incentives, like the Renewable Energy Sources Act.\n    - B: Increase the cost of solar panels.\n    - C: Decrease the production of solar panels.\n    - D: Provide no support for solar energy adoption.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can homeowners benefit from investing in rooftop solar panels?\n    - A: By increasing their energy bills.\n    - B: By reducing their energy bills and contributing to a cleaner energy future.\n    - C: By having no impact on their energy bills.\n    - D: By only benefiting from the aesthetic appeal of solar panels.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the increased demand for solar panels and the decrease in prices?\n    - A: The increased demand led to an increase in prices.\n    - B: The increased demand had no impact on prices.\n    - C: The increased demand led to a decrease in prices due to economies of scale and innovation.\n    - D: The decreased demand led to a decrease in prices.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does the initial cost of solar cells in 1954 compare to the current cost of rooftop solar units?\n    - A: The initial cost was lower than the current cost.\n    - B: The initial cost was significantly higher than the current cost.\n    - C: The initial cost was the same as the current cost.\n    - D: There is no contrast between the two costs.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential new model for making solar energy more accessible?\n    - A: Combining community-based solutions with solar leasing models.\n    - B: Implementing policies to increase the cost of solar panels.\n    - C: Decreasing the production of solar panels.\n    - D: Providing no support for solar energy adoption.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can rooftop solar units be integrated with larger-scale wind and solar farms?\n    - A: By creating a more comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the energy grid.\n    - B: By increasing the reliance on fossil fuels.\n    - C: By having no impact on the energy grid.\n    - D: By only benefiting from the aesthetic appeal of solar panels.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the effectiveness of the Renewable Energy Sources Act be evaluated?\n    - A: By assessing the increase in fossil fuel consumption.\n    - B: By evaluating the decrease in solar panel prices and the increase in solar adoption.\n    - C: By analyzing the increase in energy bills.\n    - D: By justifying the investment in rooftop solar panels based on potential savings.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a key consideration for justifying the investment in rooftop solar panels?\n    - A: The potential increase in energy bills.\n    - B: The potential decrease in energy bills and contribution to a cleaner energy future.\n    - C: The aesthetic appeal of solar panels.\n    - D: The potential decrease in fossil fuel consumption alone.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo major changes were necessary, but I made some minor adjustments to improve clarity and concision. The questions now better align with the key concepts in the transcript, and the distractors are more plausible but incorrect."
