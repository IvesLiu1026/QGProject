    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) When did Takhi horses become extinct in the wild?\n    - A: Late 1800s\n    - B: Early 1900s\n    - C: Late 1960s\n    - D: Early 1990s\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who received the remains of a wild Takhi horse in the late 1800s?\n    - A: A Russian zoologist\n    - B: Nikolay Przhevalsky's colleague\n    - C: Nikolay Przhevalsky\n    - D: An American explorer\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What was the perceived evolutionary significance of the Takhi horse?\n    - A: A hybrid between wild asses and modern horses\n    - B: A distinct subspecies of modern horses\n    - C: A \"missing link\" between wild asses and modern horses\n    - D: A separate genus from modern horses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What was the primary goal of the initial Takhi breeding program?\n    - A: To release Takhi horses into a new habitat\n    - B: To develop a new breed of domesticated horses\n    - C: To sustain the captive population of Takhi horses\n    - D: To create a new subspecies of Takhi horses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can the experience with the Takhi horse inform the development of?\n    - A: Conservation efforts for domesticated species\n    - B: Breeding programs for other endangered species\n    - C: Habitat preservation strategies for invasive species\n    - D: Research on animal behavior in zoos\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a key takeaway from the Takhi horse experience that can be applied to conservation efforts worldwide?\n    - A: The importance of preserving natural habitats\n    - B: The need for more zoos and breeding programs\n    - C: The benefits of introducing non-native species\n    - D: The effectiveness of conservation efforts without zoos\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How did the near-extinction of the Takhi horse and other species influence the role of zoos in conservation?\n    - A: Zoos shifted their focus from entertainment to conservation\n    - B: Zoos became less involved in conservation efforts\n    - C: Zoos had no impact on the conservation of the Takhi horse\n    - D: Zoos were directly responsible for the Takhi horse's extinction\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is a notable difference between the original Takhi horses and the introduced horses?\n    - A: The introduced horses were more aggressive\n    - B: The original horses were larger in size\n    - C: The introduced horses were bred in captivity with a standardized appearance\n    - D: The original horses had a different coat color\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be achieved by integrating the experience with the Takhi horse into broader discussions about the role of zoos in conservation?\n    - A: A better understanding of animal behavior in zoos\n    - B: Improved conservation efforts for domesticated species\n    - C: A more nuanced understanding of the role of zoos in conservation\n    - D: The development of new breeding programs for invasive species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a key consideration when critiquing the role of zoos in conservation?\n    - A: The entertainment value of zoos\n    - B: The potential impact of zoos on animal welfare and habitat preservation\n    - C: The effectiveness of zoos in breeding domesticated species\n    - D: The ability of zoos to support research on animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant and not adding new information.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
