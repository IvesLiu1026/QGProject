    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The Pope has been the supreme spiritual authority for Catholics for almost two millennia.\n2. In the late 14th century, there were three popes at the same time.\n3. King Philip IV of France raised taxes on the Church in 1296.\n4. Pope Boniface VIII wrote the \"Unam Sanctam\" decree asserting the Pope's supremacy over earthly rulers.\n5. Pope Clement V moved the seat of the papacy to Avignon in 1309.\n6. The papacy remained in Avignon for the terms of seven popes until 1376.\n7. The Council of Constance in 1417 united the church under a new Pope, Martin V.\n8. The schism lasted for 39 years.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The conflict between the Church and the French monarchy led to the papal schism.\n2. Pope Boniface VIII's \"Unam Sanctam\" decree was a response to King Philip IV's attempt to tax the Church.\n3.

The Romans wanted to elect an Italian pope to restore Rome as the seat of Western Christendom.\n5. The cardinals declared the election of Pope Urban VI illegitimate due to pressure from the Roman mob.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. The papal schism demonstrates the challenges of resolving conflicts between powerful institutions.\n2. The situation highlights the importance of clear lines of authority and decision-making processes in organizations.\n3. The schism shows how power struggles can lead to divisions and conflicts, even in institutions supposed to be guided by spiritual principles.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The papal schism was caused by a combination of factors, including the conflict between the Church and the French monarchy, the desire for power and control, and the lack of clear lines of authority.\n2. The schism led to a division between the Avignon and Roman lines, with each side claiming legitimacy.\n3. The situation was further complicated by the involvement of European rulers, who were forced to choose sides.\n4. The Council of Constance in 1417 was a turning point in resolving the schism, as it brought together representatives from both sides and led to the election of a new Pope.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. The papal schism highlights the tension between spiritual authority and temporal power.\n2. The situation demonstrates the challenges of balancing the need for institutional stability with the need for reform and change.\n3. The schism shows how the pursuit of power and control can lead to divisions and conflicts, even in institutions guided by spiritual principles.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Was the decision of Pope Clement V to move the papacy to Avignon justified, given the circumstances?\n2. Was the election of Pope Urban VI legitimate, despite the pressure from the Roman mob?\n3. Was the Council of Constance in 1417 effective in resolving the schism, and what were the implications of its decisions?\n4. How did the papal schism reflect the broader tensions between the Church and the secular powers of Europe during this period?"
