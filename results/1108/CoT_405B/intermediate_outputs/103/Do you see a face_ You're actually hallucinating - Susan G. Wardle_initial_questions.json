    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the name of the phenomenon where humans see faces in mundane objects?\n    - A: Face perception\n    - B: Face pareidolia\n    - C: Facial recognition\n    - D: Object identification\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which region of the brain is involved in face detection?\n    - A: Temporal lobe\n    - B: Fusiform face area\n    - C: Cerebral cortex\n    - D: Hippocampus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) Why is reading faces crucial for humans?\n    - A: Because humans are solitary animals\n    - B: Because humans are social animals and need to understand each other\n    - C: Because faces are aesthetically pleasing\n    - D: Because faces are irrelevant to human interaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What might be a byproduct of an evolutionarily advantageous shortcut for processing visual input?\n    - A: Face blindness\n    - B: Face pareidolia\n    - C: Enhanced visual acuity\n    - D: Reduced reaction time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) Where can face pareidolia be seen in everyday life?\n    - A: Only in people with neurological disorders\n    - B: Only in children\n    - C: In clouds or objects\n    - D: Only in individuals with high IQ\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What can understanding face pareidolia help us appreciate?\n    - A: The simplicity of human perception\n    - B: The complexities of human perception\n    - C: The limitations of artificial intelligence\n    - D: The importance of visual acuity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between face pareidolia and the brain's sensitivity to face-like structures?\n    - A: The brain's sensitivity to face-like structures reduces the occurrence of face pareidolia\n    - B: The brain's sensitivity to face-like structures has no effect on face pareidolia\n    - C: The brain's sensitivity to face-like structures increases the occurrence of face pareidolia\n    - D: The brain's sensitivity to face-like structures is unrelated to face pareidolia\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the contrast between the brain's ability to quickly identify faces and its tendency to see illusory faces?\n    - A: The brain quickly identifies faces but never sees illusory faces\n    - B: The brain quickly identifies faces but sometimes sees illusory faces\n    - C: The brain slowly identifies faces but never sees illusory faces\n    - D: The brain slowly identifies faces but sometimes sees illusory faces\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What can be understood by combining the concepts of face pareidolia and the brain's sensitivity to face-like structures?\n    - A: The underlying mechanisms of face perception\n    - B: The importance of visual acuity\n    - C: The limitations of artificial intelligence\n    - D: The simplicity of human perception\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be explained by integrating the ideas of evolution, social behavior, and perception?\n    - A: The occurrence of face blindness\n    - B: The occurrence of face pareidolia\n    - C: The importance of auditory perception\n    - D: The limitations of human memory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is the significance of face pareidolia in understanding human perception and behavior?\n    - A: Face pareidolia is insignificant in understanding human perception and behavior\n    - B: Face pareidolia is moderately significant in understanding human perception and behavior\n    - C: Face pareidolia is highly significant in understanding human perception and behavior\n    - D: Face pareidolia is only significant in understanding animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is continued research on face pareidolia important?\n    - A: Because it has no practical applications\n    - B: Because it can inform the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms\n    - C: Because it is a trivial aspect of human perception\n    - D: Because it is only relevant to neuroscience\n[Correct answer]: B"
