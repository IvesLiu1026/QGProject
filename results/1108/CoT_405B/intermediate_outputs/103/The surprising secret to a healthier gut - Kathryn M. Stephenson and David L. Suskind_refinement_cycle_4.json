What potential treatment option could be considered?\n    - A: Antibiotics\n    - B: Fecal microbial transplantation\n    - C: Surgery\n    - D: Dietary changes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What are potential applications of fecal transplants beyond treating antibiotic-resistant Clostridiodes difficile?\n    - A: Treating type 1 diabetes\n    - B: Treating type 2 diabetes and anxiety and depression\n    - C: Treating autoimmune disorders\n    - D: Treating oncologic disorders\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a critical factor influencing the effectiveness of fecal transplants?\n    - A: The quality of the donated stool sample\n    - B: The age of the patient\n    - C: The severity of the disease\n    - D: The duration of treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can occur when there is an imbalance in the gut microbiome?\n    - A: The immune system is boosted\n    - B: The gut becomes more resistant to infections\n    - C: Negative consequences for human health can arise\n    - D: The gut becomes more efficient at breaking down food\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining knowledge of the gut microbiome with fecal microbial transplantation?\n    - A: New treatments for various disorders\n    - B: Improved understanding of the immune system\n    - C: Development of new antibiotics\n    - D: Enhanced understanding of the digestive system\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) Why is the FDA's classification of fecal transplants as an experimental treatment justified?\n    - A: Due to the high cost of treatment\n    - B: Due to the unique nature of each stool sample\n    - C: Due to the limited availability of stool banks\n    - D: Due to the lack of trained medical professionals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of fecal transplants?\n    - A: Strict protocols in place for stool banks\n    - B: Mandatory screening for donors\n    - C: Standardized treatment protocols\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) How do infants typically acquire their initial gut microbiome?\n    - A: Through exposure to environmental bacteria\n    - B: Through breastfeeding\n    - C: During a vaginal birth\n    - D: Through antibiotic treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What is a potential future application of fecal transplants?\n    - A: Treating autoimmune disorders\n    - B: Treating oncologic disorders\n    - C: Treating psychiatric disorders\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 14 and 15 as they were similar to other questions, and question 10 was revised to better align with the transcript. Additionally, I made minor changes to the wording and distractors of some questions to enhance clarity and concision. No more refinement needed."
