    "content_analysis": "Here is the analysis of the transcript, categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1. In 2018, an orca named Tahlequah gave birth to a daughter who died within an hour.\n2. Tahlequah carried her daughter's body for 17 days and 1,600 kilometers.\n3. Charles Darwin argued in 1871 that other animals experience a wide range of emotions, including grief.\n4. A gorilla named Koko was trained to use American Sign Language and expressed distress and sadness when her kitten companion died.\n5. An elephant matriarch named Eleanor died in 2003, and other elephants visited her body and displayed behaviors that could be interpreted as grief.\n6. Researchers have analyzed baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids, which are stress hormones that spike when humans are bereaved.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The concept of grief in non-human animals is complex and has been debated by scientists.\n2. The paradigm that humans are exceptional and other animals only react and survive has been challenged.\n3. Some animals, including mammals and birds, may experience what we call grief.\n4. Researchers have observed behaviors in animals that could be interpreted as grief, such as carrying the remains of family members or displaying distress calls.\n5. The emotional landscapes of other animals are severely limited, and more research is needed to understand mourning in the animal kingdom.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Understanding whether non-human animals experience grief has implications for how we treat them, such as determining if orcas should be isolated and kept in captivity.\n2. Recognizing that animals may experience grief could inform our decisions about animal welfare and conservation.\n3. The study of animal grief could also inform our understanding of human grief and how to support individuals who are experiencing loss.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between animal behavior and grief is complex, and it is difficult to determine whether animals are truly experiencing grief or just displaying irregular behaviors.\n2. The study of animal grief challenges the paradigm that humans are exceptional and other animals only react and survive.\n3. The observation of behaviors in animals that could be interpreted as grief, such as carrying the remains of family members, suggests that some animals may experience what we call grief.\n4. The analysis of baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids suggests that some animals may experience stress and anxiety in response to death.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining the study of animal behavior and grief could provide new insights into the emotional landscapes of other animals.\n2. Recognizing that animals may experience grief could lead to a greater understanding of the importance of social bonds and relationships in animal societies.\n3. The study of animal grief could also inform our understanding of the evolution of emotions and the development of complex social behaviors.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Should we treat non-human animals like they may have the capacity to grieve, or assume they don't?\n2. Which belief could cause more harm: assuming that animals do not experience grief or recognizing that they may?\n3. How do our assumptions about animal grief inform our decisions about animal welfare and conservation?\n4. What are the implications of recognizing that animals may experience grief for our understanding of human grief and how to support individuals who are experiencing loss?"
