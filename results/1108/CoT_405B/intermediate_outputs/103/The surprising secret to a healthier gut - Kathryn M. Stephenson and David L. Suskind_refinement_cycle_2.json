What potential treatment option could be considered?\n    - A: Antibiotics\n    - B: Fecal microbial transplantation\n    - C: Surgery\n    - D: Dietary changes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential application of fecal transplants beyond treating antibiotic-resistant Clostridiodes difficile?\n    - A: Treating type 1 diabetes\n    - B: Treating type 2 diabetes\n    - C: Treating cancer\n    - D: Treating anxiety and depression\n[Correct answer]: B (and D, as research also suggests potential benefits for anxiety and depression)\n\n7) What is a critical factor influencing the effectiveness of fecal transplants?\n    - A: The quality of the donated stool sample\n    - B: The age of the patient\n    - C: The severity of the disease\n    - D: The duration of treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can occur when there is an imbalance in the gut microbiome?\n    - A: The immune system is boosted\n    - B: The gut becomes more resistant to infections\n    - C: Negative consequences for human health can arise\n    - D: The gut becomes more efficient at breaking down food\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining knowledge of the gut microbiome with fecal microbial transplantation?\n    - A: New treatments for various disorders\n    - B: Improved understanding of the immune system\n    - C: Development of new antibiotics\n    - D: Enhanced understanding of the digestive system\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be a potential benefit of expanding the use of fecal transplants beyond treating antibiotic-resistant Clostridiodes difficile?\n    - A: Reduced risk of infections\n    - B: New insights into the causes and treatments of diseases\n    - C: Improved understanding of the gut-brain axis\n    - D: Enhanced understanding of the immune system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is the FDA's classification of fecal transplants as an experimental treatment justified?\n    - A: Due to the high cost of treatment\n    - B: Due to the unique nature of each stool sample\n    - C: Due to the limited availability of stool banks\n    - D: Due to the lack of trained medical professionals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of fecal transplants?\n    - A: Strict protocols in place for stool banks\n    - B: Mandatory screening for donors\n    - C: Standardized treatment protocols\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Clarified language and formatting\n- Made minor adjustments to distractors to improve plausibility\n- Emphasized the importance of the gut microbiome and fecal transplants in human health\n- Highlighted the potential benefits and applications of fecal transplants beyond treating antibiotic-resistant Clostridiodes difficile\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, as they were already well-aligned with the transcript and key concepts."
