    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the mass of a Helium atom?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 4\n    - C: 6\n    - D: 8\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the boiling point of Helium in degrees centigrade?\n    - A: -200\n    - B: -250\n    - C: -269\n    - D: -300\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why is Helium used in balloons instead of Hydrogen?\n    - A: Because Helium is cheaper than Hydrogen\n    - B: Because Helium is more reactive than Hydrogen\n    - C: Because Helium is lighter than air and safer than Hydrogen\n    - D: Because Helium is more abundant than Hydrogen\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why does Helium affect the human voice?\n    - A: Because Helium is an inert gas\n    - B: Because Helium is lighter than air\n    - C: Because the speed of sound is greater in Helium than in ordinary gases\n    - D: Because Helium is more reactive than other elements\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a common use of liquid Helium?\n    - A: To create powerful acids\n    - B: To cool materials and create powerful magnets\n    - C: To accelerate chemical reactions\n    - D: To purify water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) In what type of systems is Helium often used to achieve very low temperatures?\n    - A: Heating systems\n    - B: Refrigeration systems\n    - C: Air conditioning systems\n    - D: Ventilation systems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the temperature of Helium affect its volume?\n    - A: As temperature increases, volume decreases\n    - B: As temperature increases, volume remains constant\n    - C: As temperature increases, volume increases\n    - D: As temperature decreases, volume remains constant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a potential consequence of releasing Helium into the atmosphere?\n    - A: It can cause air pollution\n    - B: It can contribute to climate change\n    - C: It can lead to a loss of Helium into outer space\n    - D: It can cause Helium to become a greenhouse gas\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a unique property of Helium that makes it useful for medical applications?\n    - A: Its high reactivity\n    - B: Its low boiling point\n    - C: Its ability to create powerful magnets\n    - D: Its low density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How is Helium used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines?\n    - A: As a coolant to create powerful magnets\n    - B: As a contrast agent to enhance images\n    - C: As a fuel to power the machine\n    - D: As a shielding material to protect the machine\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential risk of handling liquid Helium?\n    - A: It can cause allergic reactions\n    - B: It can lead to respiratory problems\n    - C: It can cause frostbite due to its extremely low temperature\n    - D: It can lead to a loss of atmospheric pressure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How effective is Helium in detecting leaks in high-pressure and high-vacuum operators?\n    - A: Not effective at all\n    - B: Somewhat effective\n    - C: Very effective\n    - D: Extremely effective\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 9 and 10 from the initial set as they were not directly related to the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Additionally, I changed the distractors for some questions to make them more plausible but incorrect."
