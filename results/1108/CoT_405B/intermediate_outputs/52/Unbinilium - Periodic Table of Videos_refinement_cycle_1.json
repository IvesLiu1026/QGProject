    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Where is the speaker attending a conference before starting a lecture tour?\n    - A: Melbourne, Australia\n    - B: Sydney, Australia\n    - C: Perth, Australia\n    - D: Canberra, Australia\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the current state of the periodic table in terms of evidence for elements?\n    - A: Up to element 114\n    - B: Up to element 116\n    - C: Up to element 118\n    - D: Up to element 120\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the goal of the experiment described by the speaker?\n    - A: To create element 119 by combining titanium and californium\n    - B: To create element 120 by combining titanium and californium\n    - C: To create element 121 by combining titanium and californium\n    - D: To create element 122 by combining titanium and californium\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why are elements with even proton numbers more stable, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Due to the shell structure of electrons in the atom\n    - B: Due to the shell structure of neutrons and protons in the nucleus\n    - C: Due to the increasing probability of successful collisions\n    - D: The speaker does not explain why\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What could the discovery of super-heavy elements potentially lead to, according to the speaker?\n    - A: A better understanding of atomic structure and the rules that govern it\n    - B: The development of new materials or technologies\n    - C: A deeper understanding of quantum mechanics\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is the \"island of stability\" concept related to, according to the speaker?\n    - A: The shell structure of electrons in the atom\n    - B: The shell structure of neutrons and protons in the nucleus\n    - C: The probability of successful collisions\n    - D: The discovery of super-heavy elements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the stability of elements and their proton numbers, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Elements with even proton numbers are less stable\n    - B: Elements with odd proton numbers are more stable\n    - C: Elements with even proton numbers are more stable\n    - D: There is no relationship between stability and proton numbers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) Why does the speaker justify the experiment's importance, despite its potential lack of immediate practical applications?\n    - A: Because it could advance our understanding of atomic structure\n    - B: Because it could lead to the development of new materials or technologies\n    - C: Because it could deepen our understanding of quantum mechanics\n    - D: Because it could lead to a better understanding of climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What does the speaker note as a challenge or limitation of creating super-heavy elements?\n    - A: The decreasing probability of successful collisions as the target nucleus becomes heavier\n    - B: The increasing probability of successful collisions as the target nucleus becomes heavier\n    - C: The lack of funding for the experiment\n    - D: The complexity of the experimental design\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the purpose of the separator in the experiment, according to the speaker?\n    - A: To accelerate the titanium nuclei to high speeds\n    - B: To detect the fragments produced by the decay of element 120\n    - C: To separate the desired nucleus from other fragments\n    - D: To create a magnetic field\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant or not directly related to the key concepts. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. No more refinement needed."
