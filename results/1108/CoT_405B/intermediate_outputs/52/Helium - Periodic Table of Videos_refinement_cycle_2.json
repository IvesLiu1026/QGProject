    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and initial set of questions, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the mass of a Helium atom?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 4\n    - C: 6\n    - D: 8\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the boiling point of Helium in degrees centigrade?\n    - A: -200\n    - B: -250\n    - C: -269\n    - D: -300\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) Why is Helium used in balloons instead of Hydrogen?\n    - A: Because Helium is cheaper than Hydrogen\n    - B: Because Helium is more reactive than Hydrogen\n    - C: Because Helium is lighter than air and safer than Hydrogen\n    - D: Because Helium is more abundant than Hydrogen\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined: \"safer\" implies that Hydrogen is not safe, which is correct. However, the question can be rephrased for clarity:\n3) Why is Helium preferred over Hydrogen for filling balloons?\n    - A: Because Helium is cheaper than Hydrogen\n    - B: Because Helium is more reactive than Hydrogen\n    - C: Because Helium is a safer and less reactive alternative to Hydrogen\n    - D: Because Helium is more abundant than Hydrogen\n\n4) Why does Helium affect the human voice?\n    - A: Because Helium is an inert gas\n    - B: Because Helium is lighter than air\n    - C: Because the speed of sound is greater in Helium than in ordinary gases\n    - D: Because Helium is more reactive than other elements\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What is a common use of liquid Helium?\n    - A: To create powerful acids\n    - B: To cool materials and create powerful magnets\n    - C: To accelerate chemical reactions\n    - D: To purify water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) In what type of systems is Helium often used to achieve very low temperatures?\n    - A: Heating systems\n    - B: Refrigeration systems\n    - C: Air conditioning systems\n    - D: Ventilation systems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) How does the temperature of Helium affect its volume?\n    - A: As temperature increases, volume decreases\n    - B: As temperature increases, volume remains constant\n    - C: As temperature increases, volume increases\n    - D: As temperature decreases, volume remains constant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is a potential consequence of releasing Helium into the atmosphere?\n    - A: It can cause air pollution\n    - B: It can contribute to climate change\n    - C: It can lead to a loss of Helium into outer space\n    - D: It can cause Helium to become a greenhouse gas\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is a unique property of Helium that makes it useful for medical applications?\n    - A: Its high reactivity\n    - B: Its low boiling point\n    - C: Its ability to create powerful magnets\n    - D: Its low density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined: The question can be rephrased for clarity:\n9) What property of Helium makes it useful for medical applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?\n    - A: Its high reactivity\n    - B: Its low boiling point\n    - C: Its ability to create powerful magnets when cooled to extremely low temperatures\n    - D: Its low density\n\n10) How is Helium used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines?\n    - A: As a coolant to create powerful magnets\n    - B: As a contrast agent to enhance images\n    - C: As a fuel to power the machine\n    - D: As a shielding material to protect the machine\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is a potential risk of handling liquid Helium?\n    - A: It can cause allergic reactions\n    - B: It can lead to respiratory problems\n    - C: It can cause frostbite due to its extremely low temperature\n    - D: It can lead to a loss of atmospheric pressure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) How effective is Helium in detecting leaks in high-pressure and high-vacuum operators?\n    - A: Not effective at all\n    - B: Somewhat effective\n    - C: Very effective\n    - D: Extremely effective\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional refinement suggestions:\n\n- Consider adding more questions to cover the topic of Helium's natural occurrence, its formation through radioactive decay, and its extraction from natural gas.\n- Some questions can be rephrased to make them more concise and clear.\n- Consider adding more distractors to some questions to make them more challenging."
