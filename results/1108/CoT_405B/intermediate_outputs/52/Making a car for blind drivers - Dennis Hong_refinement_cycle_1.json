    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who led the project to develop a vehicle for the visually impaired?\n    - A: Dennis Hong\n    - B: A researcher from the National Federation of the Blind\n    - C: An engineer from DARPA\n    - D: A scientist from the Daytona International Speedway\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What was the amount of money won by the project team in the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007?\n    - A: $100,000\n    - B: $250,000\n    - C: $500,000\n    - D: $1,000,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary goal of the project to develop a vehicle for the visually impaired?\n    - A: To create a vehicle that can drive autonomously\n    - B: To bring freedom and independence to the blind by developing a vehicle that they can drive safely and independently\n    - C: To improve the safety features of existing vehicles\n    - D: To develop a vehicle that can be driven by people with disabilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the challenges of developing a vehicle that can be driven by a blind person?\n    - A: Developing a vehicle that can drive at high speeds\n    - B: Creating a vehicle that can navigate through heavy traffic\n    - C: Designing non-visual user interfaces that can provide information to the driver\n    - D: Building a vehicle that can carry multiple passengers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a potential application of the vehicle's technology beyond its use for the visually impaired?\n    - A: Developing safer cars for sighted people\n    - B: Creating more efficient public transportation systems\n    - C: Improving the accessibility of public buildings\n    - D: Developing more advanced medical equipment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How could the non-visual user interfaces developed for the vehicle be used in other contexts?\n    - A: In classrooms or offices to assist students or employees with disabilities\n    - B: In hospitals to assist patients with mobility issues\n    - C: In restaurants to assist customers with visual impairments\n    - D: In retail stores to assist customers with hearing impairments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is one of the improvements made to the vehicle from the initial prototype to the final product?\n    - A: The addition of more advanced sensors\n    - B: The development of more sophisticated non-visual user interfaces\n    - C: The increase in the vehicle's speed and agility\n    - D: The reduction in the vehicle's size and weight\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is one of the limitations of the initial prototype of the vehicle?\n    - A: Its inability to navigate through heavy traffic\n    - B: Its limited range and speed\n    - C: Its lack of advanced safety features\n    - D: Its need for further development and refinement to be driven on real roads\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What is an example of how the vehicle's technology could be combined with other technologies to create new possibilities?\n    - A: Combining the vehicle's sensors with artificial intelligence to create a more advanced autonomous vehicle\n    - B: Integrating the vehicle's non-visual user interfaces with virtual reality technology to create a more immersive experience\n    - C: Combining the vehicle's technology with self-driving cars to create a more efficient and safe transportation system\n    - D: Using the vehicle's sensors and interfaces to improve everyday home appliances and educational settings\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is one of the potential benefits of the vehicle for the visually impaired?\n    - A: Its ability to drive autonomously\n    - B: Its potential to improve safety and independence for the blind\n    - C: Its ability to navigate through heavy traffic\n    - D: Its limited range and speed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is one of the potential risks or challenges associated with developing a vehicle that can be driven by a blind person?\n    - A: The need for further testing and validation\n    - B: The potential for accidents or injuries\n    - C: The high cost of development and production\n    - D: Addressing societal concerns and acceptance of the technology\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is the \"backseat driver problem\" in the context of the vehicle for the visually impaired?\n    - A: The need for further testing and validation\n    - B: The potential for accidents or injuries\n    - C: The reliance on instructional cues from the vehicle's system\n    - D: The high cost of development and production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some changes to the questions to improve clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also added a new question (12) to address the \"backseat driver problem\" mentioned in the transcript."
