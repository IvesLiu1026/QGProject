A: It causes fewer emissions than the transportation sector.\n    - B: It has no impact on greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - C: It causes more emissions than all trains, planes, and automobiles combined.\n    - D: It reduces emissions by absorbing carbon dioxide.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the estimated age of the below-ground fungal network (mushroom network)?\n    - A: A few thousand years old\n    - B: Over a million years old\n    - C: Over a billion years old\n    - D: A few hundred years old\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary benefit of the symbiosis between fungi and roots (mycorrhizas) in forest ecosystems?\n    - A: It allows fungi to dominate the ecosystem.\n    - B: It enables trees to compete with each other for resources.\n    - C: It enables mutual benefit and cooperation between fungi and trees.\n    - D: It has no impact on the ecosystem.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the role of mother trees in forest regeneration and carbon fixation?\n    - A: They inhibit seedling growth and carbon fixation.\n    - B: They have no impact on forest regeneration and carbon fixation.\n    - C: They play a crucial role in forest regeneration and carbon fixation, supporting seedlings and storing carbon.\n    - D: They only support their own offspring.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding forest networks inform our approach to ecosystem conservation?\n    - A: By prioritizing the removal of mother trees.\n    - B: By recognizing the importance of mother trees and fungal networks in forest conservation strategies.\n    - C: By ignoring the role of fungi in forest ecosystems.\n    - D: By focusing solely on tree planting.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of protecting forests in terms of global warming?\n    - A: It can increase greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: It has no impact on global warming.\n    - C: It can mitigate global warming and promote ecosystem health by storing carbon and supporting biodiversity.\n    - D: It can only promote ecosystem health.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Deforestation reduces greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: Deforestation has no impact on greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - C: Deforestation causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all trains, planes, and automobiles combined.\n    - D: Deforestation only affects local ecosystems.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the impact of removing mother trees on forest resilience and vulnerability?\n    - A: It increases forest resilience and reduces vulnerability.\n    - B: It has no impact on forest resilience and vulnerability.\n    - C: It reduces forest resilience and increases vulnerability, making forests more susceptible to collapse.\n    - D: It only affects tree growth.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can combining knowledge of forest networks with social and neural networks promote ecosystem healing?\n    - A: By applying forest network principles to social and neural networks to promote cooperation and mutual benefit.\n    - B: By prioritizing tree planting over network conservation.\n    - C: By focusing solely on forest conservation.\n    - D: By ignoring the role of fungi in forest ecosystems.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of integrating forest conservation with global warming mitigation strategies?\n    - A: It can increase greenhouse gas emissions.\n    - B: It can reduce the effectiveness of forest conservation.\n    - C: It can promote ecosystem health and mitigate global warming by storing carbon and supporting biodiversity.\n    - D: It can only promote ecosystem health.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a critical consideration when assessing the impact of human choices on forest health and global warming?\n    - A: Human choices have no impact on forest health and global warming.\n    - B: The impact of human choices on forest health and global warming is a critical consideration, as it can lead to ecosystem collapse or resilience.\n    - C: Forest conservation is the sole responsibility of governments.\n    - D: The role of fungi in forest ecosystems is insignificant.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a key factor in evaluating the effectiveness of forest conservation strategies?\n    - A: The number of trees planted.\n    - B: The protection of mother trees and their role in forest regeneration, as well as the preservation of fungal networks.\n    - C: The removal of fungi from forest ecosystems.\n    - D: The focus on tree growth over network conservation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
