    "content_analysis": "Based on the transcript, the following information can be categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1. Oxygen exists in two forms: O2 (two oxygen atoms joined together) and ozone (three oxygen atoms arranged like the letter V).\n2. Liquid oxygen is a blue color due to unpaired electrons within the molecular orbitals.\n3. Liquid oxygen is highly reactive and can cause energetic experiments when combined with organic molecules.\n4. Ozone is more reactive than oxygen and can be harmful if breathed in near the Earth's surface.\n5. Ozone in the upper atmosphere absorbs ultra-violet light from the sun, protecting biological species on the surface.\n6. The test for oxygen involves relighting a glowing splint in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The concept of unpaired electrons and their relationship to color and reactivity.\n2. The difference between O2 and ozone in terms of reactivity and importance in the atmosphere.\n3. The process of combustion and the role of oxygen in reigniting a flame.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Using liquid oxygen to demonstrate its reactivity and importance in combustion.\n2. Conducting the classic experiment of relighting a glowing splint to test for oxygen.\n3. Understanding the importance of ozone in the upper atmosphere and its impact on biological species.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between unpaired electrons and color in liquid oxygen.\n2. The contrast between the reactivity of O2 and ozone.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the increased oxygen content and the reigniting of the flame.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining the concepts of unpaired electrons, color, and reactivity to understand the properties of liquid oxygen.\n2. Integrating the importance of ozone in the upper atmosphere with its potential harm near the Earth's surface.\n3. Using the experiment with the glowing splint to illustrate the role of oxygen in combustion.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Judging the safety and importance of handling liquid oxygen and ozone.\n2. Evaluating the significance of ozone in the upper atmosphere and its impact on biological species.\n3. Justifying the use of the experiment with the glowing splint as a valid test for oxygen."
