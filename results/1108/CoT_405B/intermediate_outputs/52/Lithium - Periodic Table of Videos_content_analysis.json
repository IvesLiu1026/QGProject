    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Specific facts or details that can be recalled directly):\n1. Lithium is the lightest of all the alkali metals.\n2. Lithium is highly reactive.\n3. Lithium is used in organic chemistry to activate carbon-carbon bond formation.\n4. Lithium reacts with nitrogen in the air to form lithium nitride.\n5. Lithium is a very light element that can float on water.\n6. Lithium reacts with water.\n7. Lithium is stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and water.\n8. Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder or manic depression.\n\n**Comprehension** (Important concepts that require understanding or interpretation):\n1. Lithium's reactivity is evident in its rapid reaction with water and the release of hydrogen gas.\n2. The reaction of lithium with nitrogen in the air leads to the formation of a black nitride, causing the metal to lose its shiny appearance.\n3. The smell of ammonia from exposed lithium is due to the reaction of lithium with nitrogen and subsequent reaction with water in the air.\n\n**Application** (Scenarios or real-world applications where the content can be applied):\n1. Using lithium in organic chemistry for carbon-carbon bond formation.\n2. Applying lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder or manic depression.\n3. Understanding the importance of storing lithium under oil to prevent reactions with air and water.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections in the content):\n1. The relationship between lithium's reactivity and its ability to form compounds with nitrogen and water.\n2. The contrast between the shiny appearance of freshly cut lithium and its dark color after reacting with nitrogen.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between lithium's reaction with nitrogen and the subsequent smell of ammonia.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas to form new understanding):\n1. Recognizing the potential risks and challenges associated with handling lithium due to its high reactivity.\n2. Understanding the importance of proper storage and handling procedures for lithium to prevent accidents.\n3. Combining knowledge of lithium's reactivity with its applications in organic chemistry and medicine to appreciate its versatility.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n1. Assessing the effectiveness of lithium in treating bipolar disorder or manic depression.\n2. Evaluating the safety protocols for handling and storing lithium.\n3.
