    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What is the typical shape and number of sides of a snowflake?\n    - A: Four-sided and asymmetrical\n    - B: Six-sided and symmetrical\n    - C: Eight-sided and rectangular\n    - D: Ten-sided and triangular\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of bond forms between the oxygen in one water molecule and the hydrogen in another molecule?\n    - A: Covalent bond\n    - B: Hydrogen bond\n    - C: Ionic bond\n    - D: Electrostatic bond\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is responsible for the unique shape of snowflakes?\n    - A: The arrangement of oxygen molecules and covalent bonds\n    - B: The arrangement of water molecules and covalent bonds\n    - C: The arrangement of hydrogen molecules and ionic bonds\n    - D: The combination of water molecules, hydrogen bonds, and atmospheric conditions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What factors affect the growth of a snowflake as it falls?\n    - A: Only temperature\n    - B: Only humidity\n    - C: Both atmospheric conditions, such as humidity and temperature\n    - D: Neither atmospheric conditions nor temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What role does melted snow play in skiing?\n    - A: It creates a thick layer of ice that helps skis slide along\n    - B: It creates a thin layer of water that helps skis slide along\n    - C: It creates a layer of slush that hinders skiing\n    - D: It has no impact on skiing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the main difference between the formation of snowflakes and ice cubes?\n    - A: Snowflakes form through the freezing of liquid water, while ice cubes form through the direct conversion of water vapor to ice\n    - B: Snowflakes form through the direct conversion of water vapor to ice, while ice cubes form through the freezing of liquid water\n    - C: Snowflakes form through the melting of ice, while ice cubes form through the freezing of water\n    - D: Snowflakes form through the sublimation of ice, while ice cubes form through the deposition of water vapor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the angle of hydrogens and oxygen within a water molecule relate to the hexagonal structure of snowflakes?\n    - A: The angle of 90 degrees leads to a cubic structure\n    - B: The angle of 104.5 degrees leads to a hexagonal structure\n    - C: The angle of 120 degrees leads to a triangular structure\n    - D: There is no relationship between the angle and the structure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the scientific basis for the unique shape and growth of snowflakes?\n    - A: The arrangement of water molecules and hydrogen bonds is the sole factor\n    - B: Atmospheric conditions, such as humidity and temperature, are the sole factors\n    - C: The combination of the arrangement of water molecules and atmospheric conditions is the basis\n    - D: There is no scientific basis for the unique shape and growth of snowflakes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What does the statement \"it's not really snow skiing, but water skiing\" imply about the role of melted snow in skiing?\n    - A: It implies that skiing is only possible on ice\n    - B: It implies that skiing is only possible on water\n    - C: It highlights the importance of melted snow in reducing friction between skis and snow\n    - D: It has no implications for our understanding of skiing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why are snowflakes typically symmetrical?\n    - A: Because the conditions at the six sharp edges of a snowflake are identical\n    - B: Because the conditions at the six sharp edges of a snowflake are similar\n    - C: Because the conditions at the six sharp edges of a snowflake are random\n    - D: Because the conditions at the six sharp edges of a snowflake are unrelated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 10 and 11 from the initial set, as they were not directly related to the transcript or were redundant. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. Additionally, I added a new question (10) to assess understanding of the symmetry of snowflakes."
