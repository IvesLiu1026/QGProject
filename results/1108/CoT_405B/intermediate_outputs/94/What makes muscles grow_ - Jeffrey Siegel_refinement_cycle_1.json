    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of body weight is made up of muscles in humans?\n    - A: 1/4 to 1/5\n    - B: 1/3 to 1/2\n    - C: 2/3 to 3/4\n    - D: 3/4 to 4/5\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of cytokines in muscle growth and repair?\n    - A: To initiate muscle contraction and relaxation\n    - B: To activate the immune system to repair muscle damage\n    - C: To provide amino acids for new tissue growth\n    - D: To regulate hormone production for muscle growth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary mechanism by which muscles grow and become stronger?\n    - A: Through a cycle of relaxation and contraction\n    - B: Through a cycle of damage and repair\n    - C: Through a cycle of hypertrophy and atrophy\n    - D: Through a cycle of eccentric and concentric contractions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why do everyday activities often fail to stimulate new muscle growth?\n    - A: They do not engage multiple muscle groups\n    - B: They do not involve eccentric contractions\n    - C: They do not provide adequate nutrition and rest\n    - D: They do not challenge muscles beyond their normal workload\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is necessary to generate enough force to open a heavy door?\n    - A: Engaging a single muscle group\n    - B: Engaging multiple muscle groups\n    - C: Using only the muscles in the arm and shoulder\n    - D: Using only the muscles in the leg and back\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can an athlete progressively increase the intensity of their workouts to build muscle?\n    - A: Decrease the weight and increase the reps\n    - B: Increase the weight and decrease the reps\n    - C: Increase the weight and increase the reps\n    - D: Decrease the weight and decrease the reps\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between muscle damage and growth?\n    - A: Muscle damage leads to muscle atrophy\n    - B: Muscle damage leads to the release of cytokines, which activate the immune system to repair and grow muscle tissue\n    - C: Muscle damage has no effect on muscle growth\n    - D: Muscle growth leads to muscle damage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the primary contrast between muscle atrophy and hypertrophy?\n    - A: Muscle atrophy occurs when muscles are challenged, while hypertrophy occurs when muscles are not challenged\n    - B: Muscle atrophy occurs when muscles are not challenged, while hypertrophy occurs when muscles are challenged\n    - C: Muscle atrophy occurs when muscles are damaged, while hypertrophy occurs when muscles are not damaged\n    - D: Muscle atrophy occurs when muscles are not damaged, while hypertrophy occurs when muscles are damaged\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the concept of progressive overload, and how does it relate to muscle growth?\n    - A: Gradually decreasing the intensity of workouts to challenge muscles and stimulate growth\n    - B: Gradually increasing the intensity of workouts to challenge muscles and stimulate growth\n    - C: Maintaining a consistent level of intensity in workouts to challenge muscles and stimulate growth\n    - D: Alternating periods of intense training with periods of rest and recovery to optimize muscle growth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the importance of proper nutrition in muscle growth and repair?\n    - A: Providing carbohydrates for energy\n    - B: Providing protein for muscle growth and repair\n    - C: Providing fat for hormone regulation\n    - D: Providing fiber for digestive health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How can the effectiveness of a workout routine be evaluated in promoting muscle growth?\n    - A: By measuring the increase in muscle mass over time\n    - B: By measuring the decrease in muscle mass over time\n    - C: By evaluating the nutritional plan and rest schedule\n    - D: By assessing the genetic factors that influence muscle-building potential\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a valid critique of a nutritional plan for an athlete training to build muscle?\n    - A: The plan does not provide enough carbohydrates for energy\n    - B: The plan does not provide enough protein for muscle growth and repair\n    - C: The plan does not provide enough fat for hormone regulation\n    - D: The plan does not provide enough fiber for digestive health\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 10 and added a new question 10 to focus on the importance of proper nutrition in muscle growth and repair. I also refined some of the questions to improve clarity and conciseness. No more refinement is needed for questions 1-9 and 11-12."
