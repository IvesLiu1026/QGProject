    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of a cuttlefish's chromatophores?\n    - A: To attract mates\n    - B: To convey food source information\n    - C: For camouflage or warnings\n    - D: To indicate health and readiness to mate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which quality of language allows for creating an infinite number of messages?\n    - A: Discreteness\n    - B: Grammar\n    - C: Productivity\n    - D: Displacement\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is a key difference between human language and most animal communication systems?\n    - A: Human language is less complex\n    - B: Human language is limited in topics of conversation\n    - C: Human language combines grammar, productivity, discreteness, and displacement\n    - D: Human language is only used for basic needs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Which animals have demonstrated language skills, including combining signs to form original phrases?\n    - A: Bees and prairie dogs\n    - B: Dolphins and great apes\n    - C: Great apes\n    - D: Prairie dogs and dolphins\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a potential benefit of studying animal communication in the field of conservation?\n    - A: Improved animal training methods\n    - B: Enhanced understanding of human language development\n    - C: Better understanding of animal behavior to inform conservation efforts\n    - D: Development of artificial intelligence systems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How can understanding animal communication inform our interaction with animals?\n    - A: By providing insight into their social structures\n    - B: By helping us develop more effective training methods\n    - C: By allowing us to interpret their behavior more accurately\n    - D: By enabling us to communicate with them directly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is a key similarity between human language and some animal communication systems, such as bees and prairie dogs?\n    - A: They all possess a complex grammar system\n    - B: They all exhibit some language-like qualities, such as displacement\n    - C: They all have a limited range of topics for conversation\n    - D: They all rely on visual cues\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a key difference between human language and most animal communication systems in terms of their structure?\n    - A: Human language has a finite number of possible messages\n    - B: Human language lacks a system of rules for combining units\n    - C: Human language combines finite elements to create an infinite number of messages\n    - D: Human language is limited to visual cues\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can the study of animal communication and human language reveal about the evolution of language?\n    - A: That human language developed independently of animal communication\n    - B: That animal communication systems are more complex than human language\n    - C: That there may be a continuum between animal communication and human language\n    - D: That human language is the only true language\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is necessary to justify the uniqueness of human language?\n    - A: A comparison with a single animal communication system\n    - B: A critical comparison with multiple animal communication systems\n    - C: An analysis of the four qualities of language in human language only\n    - D: An assumption that human language is superior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is required to evaluate the effectiveness of an animal communication system?\n    - A: An understanding of the context and goals of the communication\n    - B: A comparison with human language\n    - C: An analysis of the system's grammar and productivity\n    - D: An assumption that the system is inferior to human language\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the primary function of a prairie dog's alarm call?\n    - A: To signal food availability\n    - B: To warn others of predators\n    - C: To communicate with other prairie dogs about social hierarchy\n    - D: To signal the location of a potential mate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is a key characteristic of human language that allows for creative expression?\n    - A: A finite number of possible messages\n    - B: A lack of grammar and rules\n    - C: The ability to combine finite elements to create an infinite number of messages\n    - D: The reliance on visual cues\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What is a potential implication of the study of animal communication and human language?\n    - A: That human language is the only true language\n    - B: That animal communication systems are irrelevant to human language\n    - C: That there may be a continuum between animal communication and human language\n    - D: That human language is superior to animal communication systems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 15 and renumbered the questions. I also made minor changes to the wording of some questions and distractors to improve clarity and concision. No more refinement needed."
