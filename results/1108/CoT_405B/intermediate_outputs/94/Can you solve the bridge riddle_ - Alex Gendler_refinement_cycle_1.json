    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many people are in the group trying to escape the zombies?\n    - A: 3\n    - B: 4\n    - C: 5\n    - D: 6\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the crossing time for the professor?\n    - A: 1 minute\n    - B: 2 minutes\n    - C: 5 minutes\n    - D: 10 minutes\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the main constraint that the group needs to manage to escape the zombies?\n    - A: The bridge's height\n    - B: The bridge's capacity and crossing times\n    - C: The lantern's weight\n    - D: The zombies' speed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the extra constraint added by the lantern's limited illumination?\n    - A: The need for more people to cross at once\n    - B: The requirement for the lantern to be held by or next to anyone crossing\n    - C: The need for the group to move faster\n    - D: The need for more time to cross the bridge\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what type of scenario might a similar problem to the bridge crossing occur?\n    - A: A sports competition\n    - B: An emergency evacuation\n    - C: A business meeting\n    - D: A school project\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What type of problem requires prioritizing tasks and allocating resources efficiently, similar to the bridge crossing problem?\n    - A: A mathematical problem\n    - B: A language problem\n    - C: A logistical problem\n    - D: A scientific problem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the crossing times and the overall time limit that the group needs to manage?\n    - A: The crossing times are independent of the overall time limit\n    - B: The crossing times are directly proportional to the overall time limit\n    - C: The crossing times create a constraint that must be managed within the overall time limit\n    - D: The crossing times are irrelevant to the overall time limit\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the trade-off that the group needs to consider when deciding who should make return trips with the lantern?\n    - A: Between having the fastest people make return trips and minimizing the time wasted by the slowest people\n    - B: Between having the slowest people make return trips and maximizing the time wasted by the fastest people\n    - C: Between having the fastest people make return trips and maximizing the time wasted by the slowest people\n    - D: Between having the slowest people make return trips and minimizing the time wasted by the fastest people\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What is a potential solution to the bridge crossing problem that combines the ideas of minimizing time wasted by the slowest people and using the fastest people for return trips?\n    - A: Having the professor and janitor cross together, followed by the lab assistant and narrator\n    - B: Having the lab assistant and narrator cross together, followed by the professor and janitor\n    - C: Having the professor cross first, followed by the janitor, lab assistant, and narrator\n    - D: Having the narrator cross first, followed by the lab assistant, janitor, and professor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a key consideration when integrating the constraints of the bridge's capacity, crossing times, and lantern's illumination to develop a plan?\n    - A: Maximizing the time wasted by the slowest people\n    - B: Minimizing the time wasted by the slowest people\n    - C: Ignoring the constraints of the bridge's capacity and crossing times\n    - D: Ignoring the constraint of the lantern's illumination\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the primary criterion for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed solution to the bridge crossing problem?\n    - A: The time it takes for the group to cross the bridge\n    - B: The number of people who cross the bridge\n    - C: The distance between the group and the zombies\n    - D: The time it takes for the zombies to catch up to the group\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a key trade-off to evaluate when considering the decision to have the lab assistant return with the lantern instead of the narrator?\n    - A: Between the time saved by having the lab assistant return and the risk of the narrator being left behind\n    - B: Between the time saved by having the narrator return and the risk of the lab assistant being left behind\n    - C: Between the time wasted by having the lab assistant return and the risk of the narrator being left behind\n    - D: Between the time wasted by having the narrator return and the risk of the lab assistant being left behind\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
