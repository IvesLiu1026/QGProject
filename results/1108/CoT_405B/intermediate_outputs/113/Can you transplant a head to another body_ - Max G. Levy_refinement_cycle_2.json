    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who performed the experiment connecting the head of Monkey A to the body of Monkey B on March 14th, 1970?\n    - A: Dr. Christiaan Barnard\n    - B: Dr. Robert White\n    - C: Dr. Daniel Hale Williams\n    - D: Dr. Joseph Murray\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What was a significant technical challenge faced by White's surgery?\n    - A: Maintaining blood pressure\n    - B: Preventing infection\n    - C: Reconnecting a severed spinal cord\n    - D: Maintaining a stable body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What was the primary objective of White's experiment?\n    - A: To develop a new technique for spinal cord repair\n    - B: To explore the possibility of a whole-brain transplant\n    - C: To understand the mind-body divide\n    - D: To explore the possibility of a whole-body transplant\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What was a potential benefit of White's proposed whole-body transplant surgery?\n    - A: Reversing the effects of aging\n    - B: Curing cancer\n    - C: Enhancing cognitive function\n    - D: Saving the lives of patients with spinal cord injuries or progressive mobility diseases\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What was the primary application of White's brain-cooling technique in medical contexts?\n    - A: To slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease\n    - B: To treat mental health disorders\n    - C: To enhance athletic performance\n    - D: To extend the time available for surgical procedures\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What field could potentially benefit from the concept of a whole-body transplant?\n    - A: Psychology\n    - B: Neuroscience\n    - C: Genetics\n    - D: Organ transplantation\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What does the experiment highlight about the relationship between the brain and body?\n    - A: That the brain controls the body's functions\n    - B: That the body controls the brain's functions\n    - C: That the brain and body are separate entities\n    - D: That the brain and body are interconnected and complex\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What question does the experiment raise about consciousness?\n    - A: Whether consciousness is solely a product of the body\n    - B: Whether consciousness exists independently of the brain and body\n    - C: Whether consciousness is solely a product of the brain\n    - D: Whether consciousness is a product of both the brain and body\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What new insight could be gained by combining the concepts of brain cooling and whole-body transplantation?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the brain's role in controlling the body's functions\n    - B: A new treatment for spinal cord injuries and progressive mobility diseases\n    - C: A better understanding of the mind-body divide\n    - D: A new approach to organ transplantation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What could be gained by integrating the findings of this experiment with modern neuroscience research on gut neurons and the microbiome?\n    - A: A new understanding of the brain's role in controlling the body's functions\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the relationship between the brain and gut\n    - C: A new approach to treating mental health disorders\n    - D: A more comprehensive understanding of the mind-body divide\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo new questions were added, and questions 11 and 12 were previously removed due to being subjective and open to interpretation. The refined questions aim to ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy, while maintaining plausible but incorrect distractors."
