    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary material used in basic filters for capturing particulate matter?\n    - A: Polypropylene or glass strands\n    - B: Activated carbon\n    - C: Cotton or polyester\n    - D: Metal or ceramic\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What percentage of particulate matter can N95 masks catch?\n    - A: At least 80%\n    - B: At least 90%\n    - C: At least 95%\n    - D: At least 99%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the main difference between size-based filters and chemical-based filters?\n    - A: Size-based filters capture larger particles, while chemical-based filters capture smaller particles\n    - B: Size-based filters capture particles by size, while chemical-based filters capture particles by chemical composition\n    - C: Size-based filters are more effective against gases, while chemical-based filters are more effective against particulate matter\n    - D: Size-based filters are more expensive, while chemical-based filters are more affordable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What role do van der Waals forces play in capturing particles in size-based filters?\n    - A: Van der Waals forces repel particles, allowing them to pass through the filter\n    - B: Van der Waals forces attract particles, allowing them to be captured by the filter\n    - C: Van der Waals forces have no effect on particle capture in size-based filters\n    - D: Van der Waals forces only affect the capture of particles larger than 2.5 microns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one way to improve indoor air quality during a wildfire?\n    - A: Opening windows to let in fresh air\n    - B: Using an air purifier with a HEPA filter\n    - C: Increasing the temperature in your home\n    - D: Reducing the humidity in your home\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is an example of a DIY air purifier that can be used to improve indoor air quality?\n    - A: A box fan with a HEPA filter\n    - B: A Corsi-Rosenthal box\n    - C: A vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter\n    - D: A humidifier with an activated carbon filter\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does climate change affect wildfire frequency and air quality?\n    - A: Climate change has no effect on wildfire frequency or air quality\n    - B: Climate change decreases wildfire frequency, which improves air quality\n    - C: Climate change increases wildfire frequency, which has no effect on air quality\n    - D: Climate change increases wildfire frequency, which worsens air quality\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the main difference between N95 and N100 masks in terms of effectiveness?\n    - A: N95 masks are more effective against gases, while N100 masks are more effective against particulate matter\n    - B: N95 masks are less effective than N100 masks against particulate matter\n    - C: N95 masks are more effective than N100 masks against particulate matter\n    - D: N95 and N100 masks are equally effective against particulate matter\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can you create a more effective mask or air purifier?\n    - A: Using a single type of filter technology\n    - B: Combining multiple types of filter technologies\n    - C: Reducing the size of the filter\n    - D: Increasing the cost of the filter\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is an example of a comprehensive air quality management system?\n    - A: An air purifier with a HEPA filter\n    - B: An air quality indicator\n    - C: A system that integrates air quality indicators with filter technology\n    - D: A system that only uses activated carbon filters\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What factors should you consider when evaluating the effectiveness of different types of filters or masks?\n    - A: Cost\n    - B: Environmental impact\n    - C: Effectiveness against particulate matter\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is a potential drawback of using activated carbon masks?\n    - A: They are more expensive than other types of masks\n    - B: They are less effective against particulate matter\n    - C: They can be heavier and more uncomfortable to wear\n    - D: They may not capture all types of pollutants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. I also rephrased question 7 to better reflect the relationship between climate change, wildfire frequency, and air quality. Additionally, I changed the correct answer for question 12 to make it more accurate and specific."
