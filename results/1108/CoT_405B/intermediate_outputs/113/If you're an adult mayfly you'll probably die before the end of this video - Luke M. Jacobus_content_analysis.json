    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Recall of specific facts or details):\n- There are approximately 4,000 mayfly species.\n- Mayflies are found near every type of freshwater body on Earth, excluding Antarctica and a few remote islands.\n- Adulthood for most mayflies lasts about one day, and for some species, it's only a matter of minutes.\n- Mayflies have no functional mouths or digestive systems as adults.\n- Some mayfly species can produce up to 12,000 eggs per individual.\n- Mayflies undergo a process called parthenogenesis, where some all-female populations can reproduce without males.\n- Mayflies' scientific name is Ephemeroptera.\n- The full mayfly life cycle was first published in 1681.\n- Mayflies spend the majority of their lives in the aquatic nymph stage.\n- Some mayfly species live as nymphs for up to two years before metamorphosis.\n- Mayflies have various habits and body forms, such as sprawlers, clingers, swimmers, crawlers, and borers.\n\n**Comprehension** (Understanding and interpretation of concepts):\n- Mayflies have a unique life cycle, with a brief adult stage and an extended nymph stage.\n- The adaptation of mayflies to ditch functional mouths and digestive systems allows them to store more eggs.\n- Mayflies play an essential role in their ecosystems, serving as a food source for many animals.\n- Mayflies are sensitive to water pollution and can be used as indicators of a water body's health.\n\n**Application** (Real-world applications and scenarios):\n- Mayflies can be used as indicators of water pollution and ecosystem health.\n- Understanding mayfly life cycles and habits can help in conservation efforts and environmental monitoring.\n- Mayflies are an important food source for many animals, including fish and birds.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, and cause-and-effect connections):\n- The brief adult stage of mayflies is a natural part of their life cycle, allowing them to focus on reproduction.\n- The adaptation of mayflies to store more eggs is essential for their survival, as relatively few mayflies reach adulthood.\n- The various habits and body forms of mayflies are related to their environment and survival strategies.\n- The presence or absence of mayflies can indicate the health of a water body.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas to form new understanding):\n- Mayflies' unique life cycle and adaptations are crucial to their survival and ecosystem role.\n- The study of mayflies can provide insights into the health of freshwater ecosystems and the impact of pollution.\n- Mayflies' sensitivity to water pollution makes them a valuable indicator species.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n- The importance of mayflies in their ecosystems and their role as indicators of water pollution.\n- The impact of human activities on mayfly populations and freshwater ecosystems.\n- The effectiveness of conservation efforts and environmental monitoring strategies that involve mayflies."
