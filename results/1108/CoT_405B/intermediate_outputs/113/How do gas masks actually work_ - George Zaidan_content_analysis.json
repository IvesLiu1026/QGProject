Wildfire frequency has more than tripled from 1996 to 2021.\n3. Climate change causes more hot, sunny days, accelerating toxic ground-level ozone production.\n4. The first rule of filters is having a tight seal.\n5. Filters can capture pollutants by size or attracting specific chemical compounds.\n6. Particulate matter from wildfire smoke is smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter.\n7. Basic filters are made of polypropylene or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair.\n8. N95 masks can catch at least 95% of particulate matter.\n9. N100 masks or air purifiers with HEPA filters can catch at least 99.97% of particulates.\n10. Activated carbon masks can trap tiny ozone molecules.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The importance of gas masks and filters in protecting against airborne threats.\n2.
