    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many mayfly species exist worldwide?\n    - A: 1,000\n    - B: 4,000\n    - C: 10,000\n    - D: 20,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the scientific name for the order of insects that includes mayflies?\n    - A: Ephemeroidea\n    - B: Ephemeroptera\n    - C: Mayflyoptera\n    - D: Aquaticoptera\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why do adult mayflies lack functional mouths and digestive systems?\n    - A: To conserve energy for reproduction\n    - B: To increase their lifespan\n    - C: To store more eggs and increase reproductive success\n    - D: To adapt to changing environments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the primary role of mayflies in their ecosystems?\n    - A: They are primary predators\n    - B: They are decomposers\n    - C: They serve as a food source for many animals and indicate ecosystem health\n    - D: They are invasive species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can mayflies be used in environmental monitoring?\n    - A: As indicators of air pollution\n    - B: As indicators of water pollution and ecosystem health\n    - C: As indicators of soil quality\n    - D: As indicators of climate change\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can the presence or absence of mayflies indicate?\n    - A: The presence of invasive species\n    - B: The health of a water body and ecosystem\n    - C: The level of air pollution\n    - D: The quality of soil\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brief adult stage of mayflies and their reproductive strategy?\n    - A: The brief adult stage allows them to focus on foraging\n    - B: The brief adult stage allows them to focus on reproduction and maximize egg production\n    - C: The brief adult stage is a result of environmental pressures\n    - D: The brief adult stage is a result of genetic mutations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) Why are mayflies considered an important indicator species?\n    - A: Because they are abundant in all freshwater ecosystems\n    - B: Because they are sensitive to water pollution and can indicate ecosystem health and resilience\n    - C: Because they are a primary food source for many animals\n    - D: Because they have a unique life cycle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can the study of mayflies provide insights into?\n    - A: The impact of climate change on ecosystems\n    - B: The health of freshwater ecosystems, the impact of pollution, and ecosystem resilience\n    - C: The behavior of invasive species\n    - D: The evolution of aquatic animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the potential impact of human activities on mayfly populations and freshwater ecosystems?\n    - A: It is likely to have a positive effect on mayfly populations and ecosystem health\n    - B: It is likely to have a neutral effect on mayfly populations and ecosystem health\n    - C: It is likely to have a negative effect on mayfly populations, ecosystem health, and resilience\n    - D: It is unlikely to have any effect on mayfly populations and ecosystem health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions that were duplicates or had similar answers, and refined the language to make the questions more concise and clear. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No more refinement needed."
