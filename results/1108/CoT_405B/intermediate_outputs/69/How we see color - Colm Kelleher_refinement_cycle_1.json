    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What is the relationship between light frequency and the color of an object?\n    - A: High-frequency light waves look red, low-frequency light waves look violet\n    - B: High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red\n    - C: High-frequency light waves look yellow, low-frequency light waves look green\n    - D: High-frequency light waves look green, low-frequency light waves look yellow\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What colors do TV manufacturers use to simulate a wide range of colors?\n    - A: Red, yellow, and blue\n    - B: Red, green, and yellow\n    - C: Red, green, and blue\n    - D: Yellow, green, and blue\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is physical color, and how does it relate to human perception?\n    - A: Physical color is a property of human perception and is dependent on light itself\n    - B: Physical color is a property of light itself and is independent of human perception\n    - C: Physical color is a result of the combination of signals sent by cone cells in the retina to the brain\n    - D: Physical color is a result of the combination of signals sent by rod cells in the retina to the brain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the brain perceive color, according to our understanding of human vision?\n    - A: The brain perceives color as a result of the combination of signals sent by rod cells in the retina\n    - B: The brain perceives color as a result of the combination of signals sent by cone cells in the retina to the brain\n    - C: The brain perceives color as a result of the combination of signals sent by both rod and cone cells in the retina\n    - D: The brain perceives color independently of the signals sent by cells in the retina\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) (Removed - duplicate of question 2)\n\n6) What should a designer consider when designing a lighting system for a public space to ensure it is effective in low-light conditions?\n    - A: The limitations of human vision in detecting colors\n    - B: The properties of light and its relationship to color\n    - C: The type of light bulbs used in the system\n    - D: The color of the walls in the public space\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between light frequency and color, and how do different frequencies interact with each other?\n    - A: High-frequency light waves interact with low-frequency light waves to produce a yellow color\n    - B: High-frequency light waves interact with low-frequency light waves to produce a violet color\n    - C: High-frequency light waves look violet, while low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, etc.\n    - D: High-frequency light waves look red, while low-frequency light waves look violet, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, etc.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect relationship between the combination of cone cell signals and the perceived color?\n    - A: The combination of cone cell signals causes the brain to perceive a specific color, but the effect is dependent on the type of cone cells\n    - B: The combination of cone cell signals causes the brain to perceive a specific color, and the effect is independent of the type of cone cells\n    - C: The combination of cone cell signals has no effect on the perceived color\n    - D: The combination of cone cell signals causes the brain to perceive a specific color, but only in low-light conditions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can combining the concepts of physical color and human perception lead to a deeper understanding of how we perceive the world around us?\n    - A: By understanding how physical color is a property of light itself, we can better understand how our brains interpret light signals\n    - B: By understanding how human perception is limited, we can better understand how physical color is a property of light itself\n    - C: By understanding how physical color and human perception interact, we can better understand how our brains process visual information\n    - D: By understanding how physical color is a result of the combination of signals sent by cone cells in the retina, we can better understand how our brains interpret light signals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What insights can be gained by integrating the ideas of light frequency, cone cells, and brain processing?\n    - A: We can gain insights into how to design more efficient lighting systems\n    - B: We can gain insights into how to design more effective visual technologies\n    - C: We can gain insights into how to improve human vision in low-light conditions\n    - D: We can gain insights into how to create new colors by combining different light frequencies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How can evaluating the limitations of human vision lead to a critique of current visual technologies?\n    - A: By understanding how human vision is limited, we can critique current visual technologies for not taking into account these limitations\n    - B: By understanding how human vision is limited, we can justify the use of current visual technologies\n    - C: By understanding how human vision is limited, we can design new visual technologies that are more effective\n    - D: By understanding how human vision is limited, we can conclude that current visual technologies are sufficient\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What justification can be provided for using three colors (red, green, and blue) in TV manufacturing?\n    - A: The use of three colors is justified because it is the most cost-effective option\n    - B: The use of three colors is justified because it is the most technologically advanced option\n    - C: The use of three colors is justified because it takes into account the properties of light and how human vision works\n    - D: The use of three colors is justified because it is the most aesthetically pleasing option\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed question 5 as it was a duplicate of question 2. The rest of the questions were refined to ensure clarity, conciseness, and plausible but incorrect distractors."
