    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of EEG and FMRI in understanding the human brain?\n    - A: To develop new treatments for diseases like epilepsy\n    - B: To create detailed images of brain structure\n    - C: To record and analyze brain activity\n    - D: To embed electrodes directly into a patient's brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the name of the disease where a faulty part of the brain starts working spontaneously?\n    - A: Alzheimer's disease\n    - B: Parkinson's disease\n    - C: Epilepsy\n    - D: Stroke\n[Correct answer]: C (No refinement needed)\n\n3) What is the current state of understanding of the human brain?\n    - A: The brain is a simple organ that is fully understood\n    - B: The brain is a complex organ that is not yet fully understood\n    - C: The brain is a complex organ that is fully understood\n    - D: The brain is still not studied by scientists\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the brain's abilities that is demonstrated by its capacity to complete sentences?\n    - A: Producing emotions\n    - B: Controlling movement\n    - C: Making predictions and solving problems\n    - D: Regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding how the brain works help in the medical field?\n    - A: By developing new treatments for diseases like epilepsy\n    - B: By creating brain-computer interfaces for gaming\n    - C: By improving vision and hearing\n    - D: By increasing muscle strength\n[Correct answer]: A (No refinement needed)\n\n6) What is one potential application of brain-computer interfaces?\n    - A: Controlling prosthetic limbs for people with spinal cord injuries\n    - B: Developing new treatments for diseases like epilepsy\n    - C: Improving vision and hearing\n    - D: Enhancing athletic performance\n[Correct answer]: A (No refinement needed)\n\n7) What can be analyzed using electrodes in the brain?\n    - A: The relationship between brain activity and specific thoughts or stimuli\n    - B: The brain's overall structure and function\n    - C: The contrast between the brain's ability to imagine complex concepts and its vulnerability to diseases like epilepsy\n    - D: The cause-and-effect connection between brain activity and emotions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is a notable aspect of the brain's ability to make predictions and solve problems?\n    - A: It is limited to simple tasks\n    - B: It is comparable to other complex systems, such as computers\n    - C: It is only possible through the use of brain-computer interfaces\n    - D: It is not yet fully understood\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be developed by combining knowledge of brain function and computer science?\n    - A: New treatments for diseases like epilepsy\n    - B: Brain-computer interfaces\n    - C: New forms of art and literature\n    - D: New approaches to learning and social interaction\n[Correct answer]: B (No refinement needed)\n\n10) What can be gained by integrating insights from psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness\n    - B: New treatments for diseases like epilepsy\n    - C: Brain-computer interfaces\n    - D: New forms of art and literature\n[Correct answer]: A (No refinement needed)\n\n11) What should be considered when evaluating the use of brain-computer interfaces to control prosthetic limbs?\n    - A: The effectiveness of the technology\n    - B: The ethics of using the technology\n    - C: The cost of the technology\n    - D: The availability of the technology\n[Correct answer]: B (No refinement needed)\n\n12) What should be evaluated when considering various treatments for epilepsy?\n    - A: The cost of the treatment\n    - B: The effectiveness of the treatment on brain function\n    - C: The availability of the treatment\n    - D: The ethics of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: B (No refinement needed)\n\nI removed no questions, as they all align with the key concepts in the transcript. However, I refined some questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect."
