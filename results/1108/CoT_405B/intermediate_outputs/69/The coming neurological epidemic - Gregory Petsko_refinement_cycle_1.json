    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the projected number of people in the United States over the age of 80 by 2050?\n    - A: 20 million\n    - B: 25 million\n    - C: 32 million\n    - D: 40 million\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma?\n    - A: Chronic high blood sugar\n    - B: High cholesterol\n    - C: Chronic high blood pressure\n    - D: Smoking\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is happening to the distribution of ages in the human population?\n    - A: It is shifting from a column to a pyramid, with the oldest at the bottom.\n    - B: It is shifting from a pyramid to a column, with the oldest at the top.\n    - C: It is becoming more evenly distributed across all ages.\n    - D: It is remaining the same, with the majority being young.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential approach to treating Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Designing drugs that function like molecular scissors to cut proteins.\n    - B: Designing drugs that function like molecular glue to stick proteins together.\n    - C: Designing drugs that function like molecular erasers to remove proteins.\n    - D: Designing drugs that function like molecular scotch tape to hold proteins in their proper shape.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What can individuals do to lower their risk of Parkinson's disease?\n    - A: Consume caffeine and avoid head injuries.\n    - B: Take fish oil and manage blood pressure.\n    - C: Exercise regularly and get enough sleep.\n    - D: All of the above.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What role are private philanthropies playing in funding research for neurologic diseases?\n    - A: They are playing a minor role, with the government providing most of the funding.\n    - B: They are playing a crucial role, with additional private support needed.\n    - C: They are not involved in funding research for neurologic diseases.\n    - D: They are only funding research for Alzheimer's disease.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between aging and the increased risk of neurologic diseases?\n    - A: As people age, their risk of neurologic diseases decreases.\n    - B: As people age, their risk of neurologic diseases remains the same.\n    - C: As people age, their risk of neurologic diseases increases exponentially.\n    - D: There is no relationship between aging and the risk of neurologic diseases.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the connection between misfolded proteins and multiple neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Misfolded proteins are only associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n    - B: Misfolded proteins are only associated with Parkinson's disease.\n    - C: Misfolded proteins are associated with multiple neurologic diseases.\n    - D: There is no connection between misfolded proteins and neurologic diseases.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential approach to treating multiple neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Targeting a specific gene associated with each disease.\n    - B: Targeting a specific protein associated with each disease.\n    - C: Targeting misfolded proteins, which are associated with multiple neurologic diseases.\n    - D: Using a combination of drugs to treat each disease separately.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is an interesting connection between neurologic diseases and another condition?\n    - A: People with neurologic diseases have a higher incidence of most cancers.\n    - B: People with neurologic diseases have a lower incidence of most cancers.\n    - C: There is no connection between neurologic diseases and cancer.\n    - D: People with neurologic diseases have a higher incidence of heart disease.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the speaker's critique of government funding for research on neurologic diseases?\n    - A: The government is providing sufficient funding for research.\n    - B: The government is not providing enough funding for research, but private philanthropies are making up for it.\n    - C: The government has \"dropped the ball\" and is not providing enough funding for research.\n    - D: The government should only fund research for Alzheimer's disease.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is private funding important for research on neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Because it allows researchers to focus on a single disease.\n    - B: Because it provides a steady source of funding for research.\n    - C: Because it allows for innovative and high-risk research that may not be funded by the government.\n    - D: Because it is the only source of funding for research on neurologic diseases.\n[Correct answer]: C"
