    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n- \"Going viral\" refers to the rapid spread of information on the internet through networks.\n- A financial institution can be \"too big to fail\" due to its interconnectedness in the financial network.\n- Networks are collections of links that combine according to specific rules and behaviors.\n- Network theory is a discipline that studies the evolution and concentration of connections within networks.\n- Power functions are mathematical amplification mechanisms that accelerate changes logarithmically.\n- Google's algorithm uses a real-time mathematical model to predict the emergence of growing connections among search terms.\n- The six degrees of separation law states that anyone in a network is connected to anyone else through six individuals or less.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n- Networks are dynamic and constantly changing, with connections migrating and concentrating in new places over time.\n- The structure of a network can be thought of as a neighborhood, with links connecting hubs and nodes.\n- The evolution of a network is influenced by the mathematical concept of power functions.\n- Google's algorithm collects references to search objects and creates nodes and hubs based on the number of links.\n- The logarithmic expansion of a network does not eliminate the six degrees of separation law.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n- Understanding how networks work can help explain the rapid spread of information on the internet.\n- Network theory can be applied to the study of social networks, such as Facebook.\n- The concept of power functions can be used to model and predict the growth of connections in various types of networks.\n- Google's algorithm can be used as a model for understanding how to predict the emergence of growing connections in other networks.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n- The relationship between the number of links and the growth of a network is logarithmic, meaning small changes can produce large effects.\n- The structure of a network is influenced by the rules and behaviors that govern the connections between nodes and hubs.\n- The six degrees of separation law applies to social networks, despite the logarithmic expansion of the network.\n- The concept of power functions can be used to understand the rapid growth of connections in networks.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n- The combination of network theory and power functions can be used to understand and predict the growth of connections in various types of networks.\n- The concept of neighborhoods can be applied to social networks to understand the structure and evolution of connections.\n- The idea of logarithmic expansion can be combined with the six degrees of separation law to understand the interconnectedness of social networks.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n- The impact of network theory on our understanding of social networks and the internet.\n- The effectiveness of Google's algorithm in predicting the emergence of growing connections among search terms.\n- The limitations of the six degrees of separation law in explaining the complexity of social networks.\n- The potential applications and implications of understanding network theory and power functions in various fields."
