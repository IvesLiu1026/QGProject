D: They are only funding research for Alzheimer's disease.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between aging and the increased risk of neurologic diseases?\n    - A: As people age, their risk of neurologic diseases decreases.\n    - B: As people age, their risk of neurologic diseases remains the same.\n    - C: As people age, their risk of neurologic diseases increases.\n    - D: There is no relationship between aging and the risk of neurologic diseases.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the connection between misfolded proteins and multiple neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Misfolded proteins are only associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n    - B: Misfolded proteins are only associated with Parkinson's disease.\n    - C: Misfolded proteins are associated with multiple neurologic diseases.\n    - D: There is no connection between misfolded proteins and neurologic diseases.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1) What is a potential approach to treating multiple neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Targeting a specific gene associated with each disease.\n    - B: Targeting a specific protein associated with each disease.\n    - C: Targeting misfolded proteins, which are associated with multiple neurologic diseases.\n    - D: Using a combination of drugs to treat each disease separately.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is interdisciplinary research important in understanding neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Because it allows researchers to focus on a single disease.\n    - B: Because it allows researchers to understand the connections between neurologic diseases and other conditions, such as cancer.\n    - C: Because it allows researchers to develop new treatments for each disease separately.\n    - D: Because it allows researchers to compete for funding.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, or justification)**\n\n1) What is the speaker's critique of government funding for research on neurologic diseases?\n    - A: The government is providing sufficient funding for research.\n    - B: The government is not providing enough funding for research, but private philanthropies are making up for it.\n    - C: The government has \"dropped the ball\" and is not providing enough funding for research.\n    - D: The government should only fund research for Alzheimer's disease.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is private funding important for research on neurologic diseases?\n    - A: Because it allows researchers to focus on a single disease.\n    - B: Because it provides a steady source of funding for research.\n    - C: Because it allows for innovative and high-risk research that may not be funded by the government.\n    - D: Because it is the only source of funding for research on neurologic diseases.\n[Correct answer]: C"
