    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In rock-paper-scissors, how many strategies are there, and what is the outcome of each?\n    - A: Two strategies, each winning once and losing once\n    - B: Three strategies, each winning twice and losing once\n    - C: Three strategies, each losing once and winning once\n    - D: Four strategies, each winning once and losing once\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who conducted an experiment with 360 students playing rock-paper-scissors for 300 rounds each?\n    - A: A group of American researchers\n    - B: A group of Chinese scientists\n    - C: A group of European researchers\n    - D: A group of Japanese researchers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What mathematical concept can help understand the strategies of rock-paper-scissors?\n    - A: Probability theory\n    - B: Game theory\n    - C: Statistics\n    - D: Economics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to the experiment, what is a characteristic of human behavior in rock-paper-scissors games?\n    - A: Humans are completely rational in their strategy choices\n    - B: Humans are predictably irrational in their strategy choices\n    - C: Humans are randomly irrational in their strategy choices\n    - D: Humans are always unpredictable in their strategy choices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) To what fields can game theory be applied?\n    - A: Only economics and politics\n    - B: Only social sciences and psychology\n    - C: Various fields, such as economics, politics, and social sciences\n    - D: Only mathematics and statistics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What concept from the experiment can be applied to marketing and psychology?\n    - A: Predictably rational human behavior\n    - B: Predictably irrational human behavior\n    - C: Randomly irrational human behavior\n    - D: Completely rational human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What can be analyzed to understand the underlying principles of competitive strategies?\n    - A: The relationship between the experiment's findings and probability theory\n    - B: The relationship between the experiment's findings and game theory\n    - C: The relationship between the experiment's findings and statistics\n    - D: The relationship between the experiment's findings and economics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can be analyzed to understand why humans tend to make irrational decisions?\n    - A: The similarity between human behavior and optimal strategy choices\n    - B: The contrast between human behavior and optimal strategy choices\n    - C: The randomness of human behavior\n    - D: The predictability of human behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be combined to develop new strategies for winning in competitive situations?\n    - A: Rock-paper-scissors and probability theory\n    - B: Rock-paper-scissors and game theory\n    - C: Rock-paper-scissors and statistics\n    - D: Rock-paper-scissors and economics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be combined to develop new insights into human behavior and decision-making?\n    - A: The experiment's findings and psychology\n    - B: The experiment's findings and economics\n    - C: The experiment's findings and other areas of study, such as psychology and economics\n    - D: The experiment's findings and statistics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What can be evaluated to determine the validity and reliability of the experiment's findings?\n    - A: The experiment's results and conclusions\n    - B: The experiment's methodology and findings\n    - C: The experiment's methodology and results\n    - D: The experiment's conclusions and implications\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What can be done to further test the effectiveness of the best strategy to win?\n    - A: Analyzing the experiment's results and conclusions\n    - B: Evaluating the experiment's methodology and findings\n    - C: Conducting further experimentation or simulation\n    - D: Reviewing the experiment's methodology and conclusions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
