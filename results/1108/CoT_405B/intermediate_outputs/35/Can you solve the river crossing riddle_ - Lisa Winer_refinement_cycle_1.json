    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many lions and wildebeest need to cross the river to escape the wildfire?\n    - A: 2 lions and 2 wildebeest\n    - B: 3 lions and 3 wildebeest\n    - C: 4 lions and 4 wildebeest\n    - D: 5 lions and 5 wildebeest\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the maximum number of animals that the raft can carry at a time?\n    - A: 1\n    - B: 2\n    - C: 3\n    - D: 4\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary goal of the problem?\n    - A: To get all the lions across the river first\n    - B: To get all the wildebeest across the river first\n    - C: To find the fastest way to get all six animals across the river without the lions attacking the wildebeest\n    - D: To minimize the number of trips across the river\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What approach can be used to solve the problem?\n    - A: Trial and error\n    - B: Listing all possible decisions and their consequences at each point\n    - C: Using a random number generator to decide which animals to send across\n    - D: Following a set of predetermined rules\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which of the following real-world scenarios is most similar to the problem?\n    - A: A company needs to transport a large number of employees to a conference, but has limited buses.\n    - B: A hospital needs to prioritize patients for surgery, but has limited operating rooms.\n    - C: A farmer needs to transport a large number of animals to a new farm, but has limited trucks.\n    - D: A school needs to schedule classes for students, but has limited classrooms.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What type of problems can the problem-solving approach used in this scenario be applied to?\n    - A: Only problems involving animals and rivers\n    - B: Only problems involving limited resources\n    - C: Complex problems that require sequential decision-making\n    - D: Simple problems that require minimal decision-making\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the critical relationship that needs to be considered in the solution?\n    - A: The relationship between the number of lions and the number of wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - B: The relationship between the number of trips and the time of day\n    - C: The relationship between the raft's capacity and the number of animals\n    - D: The relationship between the lions' behavior and the wildebeest's behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What needs to be analyzed at each step of the solution?\n    - A: The number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - B: The consequences of each possible decision\n    - C: The time of day and the weather\n    - D: The raft's capacity and the number of animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is required to develop a solution to the problem?\n    - A: Combining different ideas and strategies\n    - B: Using a single, predetermined approach\n    - C: Ignoring the constraints of the problem\n    - D: Focusing only on the lions' behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What needs to be synthesized to develop a solution?\n    - A: Information about the raft's capacity, the lions' behavior, and the number of animals\n    - B: Information about the number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - C: Information about the time of day and the weather\n    - D: Information about the wildebeest's behavior and the number of trips\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the solution be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its efficiency, effectiveness, and number of trips\n    - B: Based on the number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - C: Based on the time of day and the weather\n    - D: Based on the raft's capacity and the number of animals\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What can the problem-solving approach used in this scenario be evaluated based on?\n    - A: Its ability to generate optimal solutions and minimize the number of trips\n    - B: Its ability to prioritize the lions' behavior\n    - C: Its ability to ignore the constraints of the problem\n    - D: Its ability to maximize the number of trips\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some of the questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript. No more major refinement is needed."
