    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, enhance clarity and conciseness, and confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) How sensitive is a dog's nose compared to a human's?\n    - A: 100 to 1,000 times more sensitive\n    - B: 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive\n    - C: 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 times more sensitive\n    - D: 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 times more sensitive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which gland is primarily responsible for the characteristic \"dog smell\"?\n    - A: Apocrine gland\n    - B: Sebaceous gland\n    - C: Salivary gland\n    - D: Adrenal gland\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What is the primary function of anal sac secretions in dogs?\n    - A: To mark territory and establish dominance\n    - B: To communicate with other dogs through chemical signals\n    - C: To protect against infections and diseases\n    - D: To regulate body temperature and metabolism\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the role of the Jacobson's organ in dog communication?\n    - A: To detect chemical signals without interference from other odors\n    - B: To detect sound waves and vocalizations\n    - C: To detect visual cues and body language\n    - D: To detect tactile stimuli and touch\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What can be learned from a dog's interest in another dog's rear end?\n    - A: The dog is trying to establish dominance\n    - B: The dog is trying to initiate play\n    - C: The dog is gathering information about the other dog's diet, gender, and emotional state\n    - D: The dog is simply being curious\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How does a dog's genetics, diet, and immune system affect their aroma?\n    - A: They have no effect on a dog's aroma\n    - B: They directly affect a dog's aroma through chemical changes in secretions\n    - C: They only affect a dog's aroma in certain breeds or ages\n    - D: They affect a dog's aroma only in puppies or senior dogs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is one potential application of studying dog aromas and chemical communication?\n    - A: Developing new training methods and techniques\n    - B: Understanding canine behavior and social interactions\n    - C: Reducing dog allergies and sensitivities\n    - D: Improving dog nutrition and dietary needs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does a dog's sense of smell compare to a human's sense of smell?\n    - A: A dog's sense of smell is less sensitive than a human's\n    - B: A dog's sense of smell is similar to a human's\n    - C: A dog's sense of smell is more sensitive than a human's\n    - D: A dog's sense of smell is not comparable to a human's\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be said about the claim that dogs are obsessed with other dogs' butts?\n    - A: It is entirely true and accurate\n    - B: It is partially true and context-dependent\n    - C: It is not entirely true, as dogs use butt-sniffing for communication and information gathering\n    - D: It is completely false and misleading\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the significance of the Jacobson's organ in dog communication?\n    - A: It is essential for detecting chemical signals without interference from other odors\n    - B: It is only important for detecting pheromones and reproductive signals\n    - C: It is not significant in dog communication and social behavior\n    - D: It is only relevant in certain breeds or contexts\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were redundant with questions 9 and 10, respectively. I also rephrased question 5 to better align with the key concepts in the transcript. No further refinement is needed for the remaining questions."
