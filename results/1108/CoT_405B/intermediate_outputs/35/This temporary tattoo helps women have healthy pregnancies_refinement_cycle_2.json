    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a common requirement for high-risk pregnancies like Jane's?\n    - A: Frequent exercise and a strict diet\n    - B: Close monitoring, often involving bed rest at the hospital\n    - C: Limited prenatal care and reduced medical attention\n    - D: Increased physical activity and reduced rest\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a characteristic of the wearable system developed by the speaker's research group?\n    - A: It is manufactured using 3D printing and is relatively thick\n    - B: It is about the thickness of a human hair and manufactured using the same processes as computer chips\n    - C: It can only monitor bodily movements and not other vital signs\n    - D: It requires a battery replacement every hour and is not energy-efficient\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a concern highlighted by the speaker regarding current monitoring methods?\n    - A: They are too affordable and accessible, leading to over-reliance\n    - B: They are limited and often require hospitalization, increasing the risk of premature birth\n    - C: They are too accurate and sensitive, leading to false alarms\n    - D: They are only available to low-risk pregnancies and not high-risk ones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is emphasized by the speaker as an important consideration when designing digital health solutions?\n    - A: Energy challenges, data plans, and patient outcomes\n    - B: Energy challenges, data plans, and privacy concerns\n    - C: Patient outcomes, privacy concerns, and insurance costs\n    - D: Energy challenges, patient outcomes, and insurance costs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the wearable system be used to benefit pregnant women like Jane?\n    - A: By providing a non-invasive and convenient way to monitor their condition\n    - B: By requiring them to be hospitalized for close monitoring\n    - C: By limiting their access to healthcare providers and increasing costs\n    - D: By increasing their risk of premature birth and complications\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of insurance companies investing in wearable devices and health coaches?\n    - A: Increased costs associated with premature births and complications\n    - B: Reduced costs associated with premature births and improved patient outcomes\n    - C: Improved patient outcomes for low-risk pregnancies only\n    - D: Increased hospitalization rates for high-risk pregnancies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a limitation of current monitoring methods identified by the speaker?\n    - A: They are too accurate and require hospitalization\n    - B: They are limited and often require hospitalization, increasing the risk of premature birth\n    - C: They are only available to African-American women and not other demographics\n    - D: They are too affordable and accessible, leading to over-reliance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between energy challenges, data plans, and privacy concerns in the context of digital health solutions?\n    - A: They are mutually exclusive and do not impact one another\n    - B: They are interconnected and must be considered together when designing digital health solutions\n    - C: Energy challenges and data plans are more important than privacy concerns\n    - D: Privacy concerns are more important than energy challenges and data plans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What combination of ideas led to the development of the wearable system for monitoring pregnant women?\n    - A: Material science, engineering, and finance\n    - B: Material science, engineering, and healthcare\n    - C: Engineering, healthcare, and insurance\n    - D: Material science, finance, and insurance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is proposed as a solution to energy and privacy concerns in the context of digital health solutions?\n    - A: The integration of algorithms into cloud-based processing\n    - B: The integration of algorithms into small integrated circuits and adhesives\n    - C: The use of wearable devices without algorithms or data analysis\n    - D: The use of health coaches without wearable devices or digital solutions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the speaker's critique of the current healthcare system?\n    - A: It is effective in addressing the needs of high-risk pregnant women\n    - B: It is limited in addressing the needs of high-risk pregnant women, particularly those from low-income backgrounds\n    - C: It is too focused on low-risk pregnancies and ignores high-risk ones\n    - D: It is too focused on insurance costs and ignores patient outcomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is implied as a potential benefit of the wearable system?\n    - A: Reduced healthcare outcomes and increased costs\n    - B: Improved patient outcomes, reduced costs, and increased access to healthcare\n    - C: Improved patient outcomes for low-risk pregnancies only\n    - D: Increased hospital"
