There are three lions and three wildebeest that need to cross a river.\n2. The raft can carry up to two animals at a time.\n3. At least one lion or wildebeest is needed to row the raft across the river.\n4. If the lions ever outnumber the wildebeest on either side of the river, they will attack the wildebeest.\n5. The solution involves 11 trips across the river.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The problem requires finding the fastest way to get all six animals across the river without the lions attacking the wildebeest.\n2. The solution involves a series of strategic decisions about which animals to send across the river at each step.\n3. The problem can be solved by listing all possible decisions and their consequences at each point.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. This problem can be applied to real-world scenarios where resources are limited, and strategic decisions need to be made to achieve a goal.\n2. The problem-solving approach used in this scenario can be applied to other complex problems that require sequential decision-making.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between the number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river is critical to the solution.\n2. The consequences of each possible decision at each step need to be analyzed to determine the optimal solution.\n3. The solution involves identifying and avoiding \"dead ends\" or scenarios that would lead to the lions attacking the wildebeest.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. The solution involves combining different ideas and strategies to achieve the goal of getting all six animals across the river safely.\n2. The problem requires synthesizing information about the constraints of the problem (e.g., the raft's capacity, the lions' behavior) to develop a solution.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. The solution can be evaluated based on its efficiency (i.e., the number of trips required) and its effectiveness (i.e., whether all six animals are safely transported across the river).\n2. The problem-solving approach used in this scenario can be evaluated based on its applicability to other complex problems and its ability to generate optimal solutions."
