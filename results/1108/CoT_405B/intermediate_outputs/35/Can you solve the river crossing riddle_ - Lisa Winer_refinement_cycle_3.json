    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many lions and wildebeest need to cross the river to escape the wildfire?\n    - A: 2 lions and 2 wildebeest\n    - B: 3 lions and 3 wildebeest\n    - C: 4 lions and 4 wildebeest\n    - D: 5 lions and 5 wildebeest\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the maximum number of animals that the raft can carry at a time?\n    - A: 1\n    - B: 2\n    - C: 3\n    - D: 4\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary goal of the problem?\n    - A: To get all the lions across the river first\n    - B: To get all the wildebeest across the river first\n    - C: To find the fastest way to get all six animals across the river without the lions attacking the wildebeest\n    - D: To minimize the number of trips across the river\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What approach can be used to solve the problem?\n    - A: Trial and error\n    - B: Listing all possible decisions and their consequences at each point\n    - C: Using a random number generator to decide which animals to send across\n    - D: Following a set of predetermined rules\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the critical relationship that needs to be considered in the solution?\n    - A: The relationship between the number of lions and the number of wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - B: The relationship between the number of trips and the time of day\n    - C: The relationship between the raft's capacity and the number of animals\n    - D: The relationship between the lions' behavior and the wildebeest's behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What type of problems can the problem-solving approach used in this scenario be applied to?\n    - A: Only problems involving animals and rivers\n    - B: Only problems involving limited resources\n    - C: Complex problems that require sequential decision-making\n    - D: Simple problems that require minimal decision-making\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What needs to be analyzed at each step of the solution?\n    - A: The number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - B: The consequences of each possible decision\n    - C: The time of day and the weather\n    - D: The raft's capacity and the number of animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is required to develop a solution to the problem?\n    - A: Combining different ideas and strategies\n    - B: Using a single, predetermined approach\n    - C: Ignoring the constraints of the problem\n    - D: Focusing only on the lions' behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What needs to be synthesized to develop a solution?\n    - A: Information about the raft's capacity, the lions' behavior, and the number of animals\n    - B: Information about the number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - C: Information about the time of day and the weather\n    - D: Information about the wildebeest's behavior and the number of trips\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can the solution be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its efficiency, effectiveness, and number of trips\n    - B: Based on the number of lions and wildebeest on each side of the river\n    - C: Based on the time of day and the weather\n    - D: Based on the raft's capacity and the number of animals\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What can the problem-solving approach used in this scenario be evaluated based on?\n    - A: Its ability to generate optimal solutions and minimize the number of trips\n    - B: Its ability to prioritize the lions' behavior\n    - C: Its ability to ignore the constraints of the problem\n    - D: Its ability to maximize the number of trips\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the minimum number of trips required to get all six animals across the river safely?\n    - A: 9\n    - B: 10\n    - C: 11\n    - D: 12\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed question 5 from the initial set, as it was not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased some of the questions to improve clarity and conciseness. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No more refinement needed."
