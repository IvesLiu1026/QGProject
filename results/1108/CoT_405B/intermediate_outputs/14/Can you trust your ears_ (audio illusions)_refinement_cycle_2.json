    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary effect of the McGurk effect on our perception?\n    - A: It alters what we see based on the sounds we hear.\n    - B: It alters what we hear based on the visuals we see.\n    - C: It has no effect on our perception.\n    - D: It creates a continuous rising pitch effect.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who is the creator of the tritone paradox illusion?\n    - A: Diana Deutsch\n    - B: Shepard Tone\n    - C: McGurk\n    - D: Unknown\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What does the tritone paradox illusion demonstrate about our brains?\n    - A: That we have a preference for which frequency to listen to, influenced by geography and language from infancy.\n    - B: That we can only hear one frequency at a time.\n    - C: That our brains are not influenced by visual cues when interpreting sounds.\n    - D: That music has a universal effect on our minds.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the effect of the Shepard tone illusion on our perception?\n    - A: It creates a continuous falling pitch effect.\n    - B: It creates a continuous rising pitch effect.\n    - C: It has no effect on our perception.\n    - D: It creates a random pitch effect.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can understanding the McGurk effect be useful in real-world applications?\n    - A: In creating more effective audio-visual presentations or advertisements.\n    - B: In music composition or sound design.\n    - C: In linguistic research or language learning.\n    - D: In music therapy or sound healing practices.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can recognizing the tritone paradox illusion be useful in music composition or sound design?\n    - A: By taking into account the diverse preferences of listeners.\n    - B: By ignoring the diverse preferences of listeners.\n    - C: By using only one frequency.\n    - D: By using only visual cues.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What does the relationship between visual and auditory cues in the McGurk effect highlight?\n    - A: The simple interaction between our senses.\n    - B: The complex interaction between our senses.\n    - C: The lack of interaction between our senses.\n    - D: The dominance of auditory cues over visual cues.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the tritone paradox illusion reveal about our auditory perception?\n    - A: That it is not influenced by cultural and linguistic background.\n    - B: That it is influenced by cultural and linguistic background.\n    - C: That it is only influenced by visual cues.\n    - D: That it is only influenced by auditory cues.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining the McGurk effect and tritone paradox illusions?\n    - A: New insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sound perception.\n    - B: A new music composition technique.\n    - C: A new sound healing practice.\n    - D: A new linguistic research method.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be a potential outcome of integrating the Shepard tone illusion with music composition techniques?\n    - A: A new, innovative soundscapes.\n    - B: A new music therapy practice.\n    - C: A new sound healing practice.\n    - D: A new linguistic research method.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is required to assess the validity of the McGurk effect and tritone paradox illusions?\n    - A: Critical evaluation of the experimental designs and results.\n    - B: Ignoring the experimental designs and results.\n    - C: Only considering the results.\n    - D: Only considering the experimental designs.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is required to evaluate the potential applications of the Shepard tone illusion in music therapy or sound healing practices?\n    - A: Consideration of its effectiveness and potential limitations.\n    - B: Ignoring its effectiveness and potential limitations.\n    - C: Only considering its effectiveness.\n    - D: Only considering its potential limitations.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined questions 13-15:\n\n13) How does the McGurk effect demonstrate the influence of visual cues on auditory perception?\n    - A: By showing that visual cues have no effect on auditory perception.\n    - B: By showing that visual cues can alter what we hear.\n    - C: By showing that auditory cues can alter what we see.\n    - D: By showing that visual and auditory cues have no interaction.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is the significance of the tritone paradox illusion in understanding auditory perception?\n    - A: It demonstrates the universality of auditory perception.\n    - B: It demonstrates the influence of cultural and linguistic background on auditory perception.\n    - C: It demonstrates the lack of interaction between visual and auditory cues.\n    - D: It demonstrates the simplicity of auditory perception.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) How can the Shepard tone illusion be used in music composition or sound design?\n    - A: To create a continuous falling pitch effect.\n    - B: To create a continuous rising pitch effect.\n    - C: To create a random pitch effect.\n    - D: To create a new, innovative soundscapes.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo more refinement needed."
