    "refinement_output": "Due to the absence of the transcript and specific details in the initial questions, I will provide general guidance on refining multiple-choice questions.\n\nWhen refining the questions, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Align with key concepts**: Review the transcript and ensure each question addresses a key concept or idea. If the transcript is not available, it is impossible to confirm alignment.\n\n2. **Enhance clarity and conciseness**: Make sure each question is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Avoid using jargon or technical terms unless necessary.\n\n3. **Confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect**: Review the distractors (incorrect options) and ensure they are plausible but incorrect. This will help to assess the test-taker's understanding of the concept.\n\n4. **Ensure correct answers are accurate**: Verify that the correct answers are accurate and align with the key concepts in the transcript.\n\nWithout the transcript, it is impossible to refine the questions accurately. If you can provide the transcript and more specific details, I would be happy to assist you in refining the questions.\n\nUntil then, I will indicate that the questions need further refinement.\n\n**Further refinement needed.**"
