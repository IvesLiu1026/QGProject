    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately what percentage of a person's lifetime is spent sleeping, assuming an average 72-year lifespan?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: 25%\n    - D: 33%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the average ideal amount of sleep for humans, according to most studies?\n    - A: 5-6 hours\n    - B: 7-8 hours\n    - C: 9-10 hours\n    - D: 11-12 hours\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a crucial aspect of sleep in human life, despite its exact function still being debated by scientists?\n    - A: To conserve energy\n    - B: To aid in digestion\n    - C: For efficient and productive functioning\n    - D: To improve physical strength\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What plays a significant role in determining the amount of sleep required by an individual?\n    - A: Diet and lifestyle\n    - B: Genetics\n    - C: Environment and lifestyle\n    - D: Age and occupation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential consequence of consistently sleeping less than seven hours per night?\n    - A: Improved cognitive function\n    - B: Increased risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes\n    - C: Enhanced mood\n    - D: Reduced risk of chronic diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What happens to an individual's brain function after prolonged sleep deprivation?\n    - A: It remains unaffected\n    - B: It recovers quickly\n    - C: It declines linearly with no sign of leveling off\n    - D: It improves over time\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is a key consequence of chronic sleep deprivation?\n    - A: Reversible and temporary cognitive impairment\n    - B: Irreversible and permanent cognitive damage\n    - C: Increased risk of chronic diseases and mortality\n    - D: Reduced risk of chronic diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is essential for individuals to do when evaluating their sleep needs?\n    - A: Consider the researcher's credentials\n    - B: Look for peer-reviewed articles\n    - C: Make informed decisions about their sleep habits\n    - D: Let their body and brain help figure out its own needs\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What can understanding individual variability in sleep needs help individuals do?\n    - A: Develop a standardized sleep schedule\n    - B: Create a sleep-conducive environment\n    - C: Develop personalized sleep strategies\n    - D: Improve their sleep quality instantly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can integrating the knowledge of sleep's importance with the understanding of individual sleep needs lead to?\n    - A: Improved cognitive function automatically\n    - B: More effective sleep habits\n    - C: Increased productivity instantly\n    - D: Enhanced mood automatically\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a crucial aspect of assessing the effectiveness of sleep strategies and interventions?\n    - A: Measuring sleep quality\n    - B: Tracking sleep duration\n    - C: Refining their approach to sleep\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is a potential risk associated with sleeping more than eight hours per night?\n    - A: Reduced risk of chronic diseases\n    - B: Improved cognitive function\n    - C: Increased risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes\n    - D: Enhanced mood\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness, while ensuring the distractors remain plausible but incorrect. The correct answers remain accurate, and the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript."
