    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Jamal lives in a poor neighborhood with underfunded schools, while Kevin lives in a wealthy neighborhood with well-funded schools.\n2. The school districts are funded by property taxes.\n3. Redlining was a practice that blocked off entire black neighborhoods from access to private and public investment.\n4. Historically, owning a home and getting a college education are the easiest ways for an American family to build wealth.\n5. A 2017 study confirmed that redlining is still affecting home values in major cities like Chicago.\n6. For every $100 of wealth held by a white family, black families have $5.04.\n7. Implicit bias refers to prejudices in society that people are not aware they have.\n8. Resumes with white-sounding names get twice as many callbacks as identical resumes with black-sounding names.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The difference in funding between Jamal's and Kevin's schools is due to the property tax system, which perpetuates systemic racism.\n2. Redlining and segregation limited opportunities for African Americans to build wealth and access education.\n3. Systemic racism is a complex issue with no single person or entity responsible, making it hard to solve.\n4. Implicit bias affects various areas of life, including employment, education, and incarceration rates.\n5. The consequences of slavery and Jim Crow laws still affect access to opportunity today.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. How might a school district implement policies to address the funding disparities between schools in different neighborhoods?\n2. What strategies can individuals use to become more aware of their own implicit biases?\n3. How can communities work together to create more equal opportunities for everyone?\n4. What are some potential systemic changes that could be made to address the disparities in family wealth, incarceration rates, and education?\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. How does the property tax system perpetuate systemic racism and affect school funding?\n2. What is the relationship between redlining, segregation, and the limited opportunities for African Americans to build wealth and access education?\n3. How does implicit bias affect employment opportunities and contribute to the disparities in unemployment rates between black and white individuals?\n4. What are the consequences of systemic racism on individuals, communities, and society as a whole?\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. How can understanding the history of systemic racism and its ongoing effects inform strategies for addressing these issues today?\n2. What role can education play in addressing implicit bias and promoting more equal opportunities for everyone?\n3. How can individuals and communities work together to create systemic changes that address the root causes of systemic racism?\n4. What are some potential solutions for addressing the disparities in family wealth, incarceration rates, and education?\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Is the current property tax system a fair and equitable way to fund schools?\n2. Can implicit bias be eliminated, or is it an inherent part of human nature?\n3. What are the moral implications of perpetuating systemic racism, and what is our collective responsibility to address these issues?\n4. How can we evaluate the effectiveness of systemic changes aimed at addressing the disparities in family wealth, incarceration rates, and education?"
