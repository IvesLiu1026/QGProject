    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What temperature is commonly instructed in baking recipes for preheating the oven?\n    - A: 200 degrees\n    - B: 300 degrees\n    - C: 350 degrees\n    - D: 400 degrees\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who is the creative director at the Institute of Culinary Education and a pastry chef?\n    - A: Michael Laiskonis\n    - B: Thomas Keller\n    - C: Gordon Ramsay\n    - D: Bobby Flay\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the primary role of temperature in baking?\n    - A: To control the texture of baked goods\n    - B: To develop color, flavor, and control moisture\n    - C: To regulate the cooking time of baked goods\n    - D: To adjust the consistency of baked goods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the Maillard reaction responsible for in baked goods?\n    - A: The development of texture and consistency\n    - B: The creation of flavor compounds and browning\n    - C: The control of moisture and temperature\n    - D: The adjustment of cooking time and temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) A recipe calls for baking cookies at 350 degrees, but you want a lighter-colored cookie. What should you do?\n    - A: Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees\n    - B: Decrease the oven temperature to 300 degrees\n    - C: Keep the oven temperature at 350 degrees and adjust the baking time\n    - D: Use a different type of flour to achieve the desired color\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) You are baking a cake in an older oven without a temperature regulator. What should you consider when following the recipe?\n    - A: The limitations of the oven and adjust the recipe accordingly\n    - B: The type of flour used in the recipe and adjust the oven temperature\n    - C: The cooking time of the cake and adjust the oven temperature\n    - D: The type of sugar used in the recipe and adjust the oven temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between temperature, moisture, and the Maillard reaction in baking?\n    - A: Temperature and moisture have no effect on the Maillard reaction\n    - B: Temperature and moisture work together to control the Maillard reaction\n    - C: Temperature controls the Maillard reaction, while moisture has no effect\n    - D: Moisture controls the Maillard reaction, while temperature has no effect\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between baking at too low a temperature and baking at too high a temperature?\n    - A: Baking at too low a temperature results in dry goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in moist goods\n    - B: Baking at too low a temperature results in moist goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in dry goods\n    - C: Baking at too low a temperature results in dry goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in burnt goods\n    - D: Baking at too low a temperature results in burnt goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in dry goods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can you combine the understanding of the Maillard reaction with the importance of oven temperature control to create new recipes or adjust existing ones?\n    - A: By ignoring the Maillard reaction and focusing on oven temperature control\n    - B: By understanding the relationship between the Maillard reaction and oven temperature control and adjusting recipes accordingly\n    - C: By using a thermometer to control oven temperature and ignoring the Maillard reaction\n    - D: By adjusting the type of flour used in recipes to control the Maillard reaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can you integrate the knowledge of historical oven limitations with modern oven capabilities to develop new baking techniques?\n    - A: By ignoring historical oven limitations and focusing on modern oven capabilities\n    - B: By understanding the limitations of historical ovens and adjusting recipes to work with modern ovens\n    - C: By using historical ovens to develop new baking techniques\n    - D: By adjusting the type of sugar used in recipes to work with modern ovens\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Is 350 degrees a justifiable standard temperature in baking recipes? Why or why not?\n    - A: Yes, because it is a safe standard for most home cooks\n    - B: No, because it is too high a temperature for most recipes\n    - C: No, because it is too low a temperature for most recipes\n    - D: Yes, because it is the only temperature that works for all recipes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Is adjusting oven temperature to achieve specific results an effective technique in baking? Why or why not?\n    - A: Yes, because it allows for control over the final product\n    - B: No, because it is too difficult to control oven temperature\n    - C: No, because it is not necessary to adjust oven temperature\n    - D: Yes, because it is the only way to achieve specific results\n[Correct answer]: A"
