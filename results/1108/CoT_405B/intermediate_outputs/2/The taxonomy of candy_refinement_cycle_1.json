    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary field of science responsible for naming and classification?\n    - A: Ecology\n    - B: Taxonomy\n    - C: Biology\n    - D: Zoology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where do the experts Olivier Rieppel, Janet Voight, Larry Heaney, and Margaret Thayer work?\n    - A: The Natural History Museum in London\n    - B: The Field Museum in Chicago\n    - C: The Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.\n    - D: The Field Museum in New York\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary goal of classification in taxonomy?\n    - A: To identify patterns and similarities\n    - B: To group objects by shape and color\n    - C: To create new categories and relationships\n    - D: To bring out evolutionary relationships\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is one of the methods used by the experts to classify the candy?\n    - A: Grouping by taste\n    - B: Grouping by shape\n    - C: Grouping by nutritional value\n    - D: Grouping by expiration date\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How do the experts apply their knowledge of taxonomy in the episode?\n    - A: By classifying living organisms\n    - B: By classifying rocks and minerals\n    - C: By classifying historical artifacts\n    - D: By classifying candy\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is one of the ways that taxonomy can be applied to everyday objects?\n    - A: By grouping them by color\n    - B: By grouping them by shape\n    - C: By grouping them by function\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What characteristics of the candy do the experts analyze to classify them?\n    - A: Shape and color\n    - B: Taste and texture\n    - C: Content and nutritional value\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is one of the relationships that the experts identify between the different types of candy?\n    - A: Similarities in shape and color\n    - B: Similarities in content and nutritional value\n    - C: Similarities in taste and texture\n    - D: Similarities in evolutionary relationships\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What do the experts combine to create a new understanding of how to classify the candy?\n    - A: Their knowledge of ecology and their observations of the candy\n    - B: Their knowledge of biology and their observations of the candy\n    - C: Their knowledge of zoology and their observations of the candy\n    - D: Their knowledge of taxonomy and their observations of the candy\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is one of the limitations of classification discussed in the episode?\n    - A: The difficulty of grouping objects by shape and color\n    - B: The challenge of identifying patterns and similarities\n    - C: The subjectivity of classification\n    - D: The complexity of classification\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the ultimate goal of classification, according to Olivier Rieppel?\n    - A: To bring order to the world\n    - B: To identify patterns and similarities\n    - C: To create new categories and relationships\n    - D: To understand evolutionary relationships\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is one of the philosophical questions raised by Olivier Rieppel regarding classification?\n    - A: Is classification a subjective process?\n    - B: Is classification a scientific discipline?\n    - C: Does the world come to us in an ordered way?\n    - D: Can classification be applied to everyday objects?\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed some questions that were redundant or not aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Additionally, I changed some distractors to make them more plausible but incorrect."
