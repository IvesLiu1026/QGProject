    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What temperature is commonly instructed in baking recipes for preheating the oven?\n    - A: 200 degrees\n    - B: 300 degrees\n    - C: 350 degrees\n    - D: 400 degrees\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who is the creative director at the Institute of Culinary Education and a pastry chef mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Michael Laiskonis\n    - B: Thomas Keller\n    - C: Gordon Ramsay\n    - D: Bobby Flay\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What are the primary roles of temperature in baking?\n    - A: To control texture and consistency\n    - B: To develop color and flavor\n    - C: To control moisture and develop color and flavor\n    - D: To regulate cooking time\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the Maillard reaction responsible for in baked goods?\n    - A: The development of texture and consistency\n    - B: The creation of flavor compounds and browning\n    - C: The control of moisture and temperature\n    - D: The adjustment of cooking time and temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A recipe calls for baking cookies at 350 degrees, but you want a lighter-colored cookie. What should you do?\n    - A: Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees\n    - B: Decrease the oven temperature to 325 degrees\n    - C: Keep the oven temperature at 350 degrees and adjust the baking time\n    - D: Use a different type of flour to achieve the desired color\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) You are baking a cake in an older oven without a temperature regulator. What should you consider when following the recipe?\n    - A: The limitations of the oven and adjust the recipe accordingly\n    - B: The type of flour used in the recipe and adjust the oven temperature\n    - C: The cooking time of the cake and adjust the oven temperature\n    - D: The type of sugar used in the recipe and adjust the oven temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do temperature and moisture interact with the Maillard reaction in baking?\n    - A: Temperature and moisture have no effect on the Maillard reaction\n    - B: Temperature and moisture work together to control the Maillard reaction\n    - C: Temperature controls the Maillard reaction, while moisture has no effect\n    - D: Moisture controls the Maillard reaction, while temperature has no effect\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the contrast between baking at too low a temperature and baking at too high a temperature?\n    - A: Baking at too low a temperature results in moist goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in dry goods\n    - B: Baking at too low a temperature results in dry goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in moist goods\n    - C: Baking at too low a temperature results in dry goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in burnt goods\n    - D: Baking at too low a temperature results in burnt goods, while baking at too high a temperature results in dry goods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can understanding the Maillard reaction help you adjust oven temperature to achieve specific results in baking?\n    - A: By ignoring the Maillard reaction and focusing on oven temperature control\n    - B: By understanding the relationship between the Maillard reaction and oven temperature control and adjusting recipes accordingly\n    - C: By using a thermometer to control oven temperature and ignoring the Maillard reaction\n    - D: By adjusting the type of flour used in recipes to control the Maillard reaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can understanding historical oven limitations help you develop in modern baking?\n    - A: New ingredients to use in recipes\n    - B: New baking techniques using modern ovens\n    - C: New types of flour to use in recipes\n    - D: New cooking times for recipes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is 350 degrees considered a standard temperature in baking recipes?\n    - A: Because it is the optimal temperature for the Maillard reaction\n    - B: Because it is a safe standard for most home cooks and accounts for oven variations\n    - C: Because it is the only temperature that works for all recipes\n    - D: Because it is the temperature that yields the best results for all types of baked goods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Is adjusting oven temperature an effective technique in baking?\n    - A: Yes, because it allows for control over the final product\n    - B: No, because it is too difficult to control oven temperature\n    - C: No, because it is not necessary to adjust oven temperature\n    - D: Yes, because it is the only way to achieve specific results\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
