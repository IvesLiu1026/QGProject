    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**\n\n1. A billion people live in stagnant economies that have been diverging from the rest of the world for 40 years.\n2. The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s, when the US helped rebuild post-war Europe.\n3. The US provided aid, opened its markets to Europe, and institutionalized trade liberalization through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\n4. The US also reversed its security policy, putting 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years.\n5. The US encouraged Europe to create the European Community and supported the creation of the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n6. The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many countries of the bottom billion.\n7. Angola alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil revenue, while the entire aid flow to the 60 countries of the bottom billion is $34 billion.\n8. Research shows that there is a threshold level of governance above which countries can benefit from resource booms, and below which they are likely to suffer from the \"resource curse.\"\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The speaker argues that the fundamental challenge of development is to give credible hope to the billion people living in stagnant economies.\n2. The alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest is necessary to address this challenge.\n3. The speaker suggests that the rich world needs to be at least as serious about developing the bottom billion as it was about rebuilding post-war Europe.\n4. Good governance is critical for countries to benefit from resource booms, and the spread of democracy has not necessarily improved governance in the bottom billion.\n5. The speaker proposes the creation of international standards to help countries harness resource revenues and improve governance.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The speaker suggests that the experience of rebuilding post-war Europe can provide a model for developing the bottom billion.\n2. The commodity booms provide an opportunity for transformational development in the bottom billion, but good governance is necessary to take advantage of this opportunity.\n3. The speaker argues that international standards can help countries improve governance and harness resource revenues, citing the example of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).\n4. The speaker suggests that verified auctions can be used to sell rights to resource extraction, citing the example of the British Treasury's sale of rights to third-generation mobile phones.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The speaker identifies a relationship between higher commodity prices and the growth of commodity-exporting countries, but notes that this relationship is complex and depends on the level of governance.\n2. The speaker argues that democracy has not necessarily improved governance in the bottom billion, and that electoral competition can actually make things worse if not accompanied by strong checks and balances.\n3. The speaker identifies a threshold level of governance above which countries can benefit from resource booms, and below which they are likely to suffer from the \"resource curse.\"\n4. The speaker argues that international standards can help countries improve governance and harness resource revenues, but notes that the cost of promulgating these standards is negligible.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The speaker combines the ideas of compassion and enlightened self-interest to argue that the rich world needs to be at least as serious about developing the bottom billion as it was about rebuilding post-war Europe.\n2. The speaker combines the ideas of good governance and international standards to argue that countries can benefit from resource booms if they have the right institutions in place.\n3. The speaker combines the ideas of democracy and checks and balances to argue that electoral competition is not enough to ensure good governance, and that strong checks and balances are necessary to prevent the \"resource curse.\"\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The speaker argues that the rich world has a moral obligation to help the bottom billion, and that this obligation is not just a matter of compassion, but also of enlightened self-interest.\n2. The speaker evaluates the effectiveness of different approaches to development, arguing that aid alone is not enough and that good governance is critical for countries to benefit from resource booms.\n3. The speaker argues that the cost of promulgating international standards is negligible, and that the benefits of these standards far outweigh the costs.\n4. The speaker evaluates the role of democracy in promoting good governance, arguing that electoral competition is not enough and that strong checks and balances are necessary to prevent the \"resource curse.\""
