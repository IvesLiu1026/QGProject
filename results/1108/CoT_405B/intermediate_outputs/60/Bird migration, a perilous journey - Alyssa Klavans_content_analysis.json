    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**:\n1. Almost 200 species of song birds spend their winters in Central and South America.\n2. Song birds migrate between a few hundred to almost 7,000 miles in several weeks to four months.\n3. Birds can lose almost one percent of their body weight per hour while flying.\n4. Over 20 billion individual birds comprise the fall population.\n5. Only about half of the fall population returns to breed the following spring.\n6. Almost one billion bird deaths are attributed to building collisions.\n7. Birds help with insect control, pollination, and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. Song birds prepare for migration by gorging on food to increase their weight and survive the journey.\n2. Human land development affects migrating song birds by altering stop-over sites and creating dangers such as pesticide ingestion and habitat loss.\n3. The decline of bird populations can have significant impacts on the ecosystem.\n4. Simple actions, such as using natural pesticides and creating green spaces, can help mitigate the threats faced by migrating birds.\n\n**Application**:\n1. Creating bird-friendly habitats in urban and suburban areas can help support migrating birds.\n2. Implementing sustainable farming practices can reduce the impact of pesticides on bird populations.\n3. Individuals can make a difference by hanging bird feeders, building bird houses, and turning out lights to reduce disorientation.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. The relationship between human land development and the decline of bird populations.\n2. The contrast between the natural migration patterns of song birds and the challenges posed by human activities.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the loss of bird populations and the potential impacts on the ecosystem.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. Combining the ideas of sustainable land development and bird conservation to create innovative solutions for protecting migrating birds.\n2. Integrating bird-friendly design principles into urban planning to minimize the impact of human development on bird populations.\n3. Developing new technologies or strategies to reduce bird collisions with buildings and other structures.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. Assessing the effectiveness of current conservation efforts and laws in protecting migrating birds.\n2. Evaluating the trade-offs between human development and bird conservation, and identifying potential solutions that balance these competing interests.\n3. Justifying the importance of protecting bird populations and the ecosystem services they provide."
