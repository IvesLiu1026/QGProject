    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many species of song birds migrate to Central and South America each winter?\n    - A: 50\n    - B: 100\n    - C: 200\n    - D: 500\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the estimated number of individual birds that comprise the fall population?\n    - A: 1 billion\n    - B: 5 billion\n    - C: 10 billion\n    - D: 20 billion\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) How do song birds prepare for their long migrations?\n    - A: By reducing their food intake to conserve energy\n    - B: By gorging on food to increase their weight and survive the journey\n    - C: By changing their migration route to avoid obstacles\n    - D: By delaying their migration to avoid harsh weather\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the primary ways human land development affects migrating song birds?\n    - A: By creating more food sources for the birds\n    - B: By altering stop-over sites and creating dangers such as pesticide ingestion and habitat loss\n    - C: By reducing the number of predators that threaten the birds\n    - D: By changing the birds' migration patterns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can individuals support migrating birds in urban and suburban areas?\n    - A: By creating more buildings and infrastructure\n    - B: By using pesticides to control insect populations\n    - C: By creating bird-friendly habitats, such as green spaces and bird feeders\n    - D: By reducing green spaces\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is one way to reduce the impact of pesticides on bird populations?\n    - A: By using more pesticides in gardens\n    - B: By using natural, plant-based products and implementing sustainable farming practices\n    - C: By creating more urban development\n    - D: By reducing the use of natural pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the potential impact of the loss of bird populations on the ecosystem?\n    - A: It would have no significant impact\n    - B: It would lead to an increase in insect populations and a decrease in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - C: It would lead to a decrease in insect populations and an increase in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - D: It would have a positive impact on the ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) Why is it important to protect bird populations and the ecosystem services they provide?\n    - A: Because birds are an important food source for humans\n    - B: Because birds provide important ecosystem services, such as insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal, that maintain a healthy environment\n    - C: Because birds are an important part of the food chain\n    - D: Because birds are a source of entertainment for humans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is one way to combine sustainable land development and bird conservation to protect migrating birds?\n    - A: By creating more urban development and using pesticides\n    - B: By integrating bird-friendly design principles into urban planning and creating green spaces\n    - C: By reducing green spaces and using more pesticides\n    - D: By creating more buildings and infrastructure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is one potential strategy to reduce bird collisions with buildings and other structures?\n    - A: By using more glass and reflective surfaces\n    - B: By developing new technologies or strategies, such as using non-reflective materials or designing bird-friendly buildings\n    - C: By creating more urban development and using pesticides\n    - D: By reducing green spaces and using more pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 11-15 as they were redundant or similar to other questions. I also refined the language and options to make the questions more clear and concise. No more refinement needed."
