    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) Approximately how many species of song birds spend their winters in Central and South America?\n    - A: 50\n    - B: 100\n    - C: 200\n    - D: 500\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How many individual birds comprise the fall population?\n    - A: 1 billion\n    - B: 5 billion\n    - C: 10 billion\n    - D: 20 billion\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) How do song birds prepare for migration?\n    - A: By reducing their food intake to conserve energy\n    - B: By gorging on food to increase their weight and survive the journey\n    - C: By changing their migration route to avoid obstacles\n    - D: By delaying their migration to avoid harsh weather\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is one of the ways human land development affects migrating song birds?\n    - A: By creating more food sources for the birds\n    - B: By altering stop-over sites and creating dangers such as pesticide ingestion and habitat loss\n    - C: By reducing the number of predators that threaten the birds\n    - D: By changing the birds' migration patterns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) What is one way to support migrating birds in urban and suburban areas?\n    - A: By creating more buildings and infrastructure\n    - B: By using pesticides to control insect populations\n    - C: By creating bird-friendly habitats\n    - D: By reducing green spaces\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can individuals make a difference in reducing the impact of pesticides on bird populations?\n    - A: By using more pesticides in their gardens\n    - B: By implementing sustainable farming practices\n    - C: By creating more urban development\n    - D: By reducing their use of natural pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between human land development and the decline of bird populations?\n    - A: Human land development has no impact on bird populations\n    - B: Human land development is the primary cause of the decline of bird populations\n    - C: Human land development is one of the factors contributing to the decline of bird populations\n    - D: The decline of bird populations is causing human land development\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the potential impact of the loss of bird populations on the ecosystem?\n    - A: It would have no significant impact\n    - B: It would lead to an increase in insect populations and a decrease in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - C: It would lead to a decrease in insect populations and an increase in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - D: It would have a positive impact on the ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What is one way to combine sustainable land development and bird conservation to protect migrating birds?\n    - A: By creating more urban development and using pesticides\n    - B: By integrating bird-friendly design principles into urban planning\n    - C: By reducing green spaces and using more pesticides\n    - D: By creating more buildings and infrastructure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is one potential strategy to reduce bird collisions with buildings and other structures?\n    - A: By using more glass and reflective surfaces\n    - B: By developing new technologies or strategies to reduce bird collisions\n    - C: By creating more urban development and using pesticides\n    - D: By reducing green spaces and using more pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is one way to assess the effectiveness of current conservation efforts and laws in protecting migrating birds?\n    - A: By evaluating the number of birds that migrate each year\n    - B: By assessing the impact of human land development on bird populations\n    - C: By evaluating the trade-offs between human development and bird conservation\n    - D: By monitoring the number of bird deaths due to building collisions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it important to protect bird populations and the ecosystem services they provide?\n    - A: Because birds are an important food source for humans\n    - B: Because birds provide important ecosystem services such as insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal\n    - C: Because birds are an important part of the food chain\n    - D: Because birds are a source of entertainment for humans\n[Correct answer]: B"
