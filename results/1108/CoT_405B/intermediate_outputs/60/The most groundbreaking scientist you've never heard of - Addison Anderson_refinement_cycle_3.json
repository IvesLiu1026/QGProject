    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Where was Nicolas Steno born?\n    - A: Italy\n    - B: Denmark\n    - C: England\n    - D: France\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who commissioned Nicolas Steno to dissect a shark?\n    - A: The King of Denmark\n    - B: The Grand Duke of Tuscany\n    - C: James Hutton\n    - D: Charles Lyell\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the core principle of uniformitarianism in geology?\n    - A: The Earth's features are the result of catastrophic events\n    - B: The Earth's processes have changed over time\n    - C: The past was shaped by processes observable today\n    - D: The Earth is only 6,000 years old\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What was the significance of Nicolas Steno's discovery of shark teeth in rock layers?\n    - A: It provided evidence for the existence of ancient humans\n    - B: It supported the idea of a young Earth\n    - C: It helped understand the origin and extinction of species\n    - D: It showed that rocks are formed through chemical reactions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A geologist is trying to date a rock layer. Which method would be most appropriate?\n    - A: Using the principles of stratigraphy to analyze the layer's position\n    - B: Analyzing the rock's mineral composition\n    - C: Studying the rock's magnetic properties\n    - D: Examining the rock's texture and color\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) A scientist is trying to understand the formation of a geological feature. Which approach would be most useful?\n    - A: Applying the principles of uniformitarianism\n    - B: Using a computer model to simulate the feature's formation\n    - C: Conducting experiments to recreate the feature\n    - D: Consulting ancient texts and philosophical deductions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How did Nicolas Steno's work on shark teeth contribute to the development of uniformitarianism?\n    - A: Steno's work on shark teeth led to the rejection of uniformitarianism\n    - B: Steno's work on shark teeth had no impact on the development of uniformitarianism\n    - C: Steno's work on shark teeth provided evidence for uniformitarianism\n    - D: Steno's work on shark teeth was a response to the development of uniformitarianism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What distinguished Nicolas Steno's approach to science from that of his contemporaries?\n    - A: His reliance on ancient texts and philosophical deductions\n    - B: His use of empirical evidence and experimental methods\n    - C: His combination of empirical evidence with philosophical deductions\n    - D: His rejection of empirical evidence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can Nicolas Steno's principles of stratigraphy be combined with modern geological techniques to better understand the Earth's history?\n    - A: By using computer models to simulate geological processes\n    - B: By integrating stratigraphy with plate tectonics and evolutionary theory\n    - C: By analyzing the mineral composition of rocks\n    - D: By studying the magnetic properties of rocks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the significance of Nicolas Steno's empirical approach to science?\n    - A: It allows scientists to rely on ancient texts and philosophical deductions\n    - B: It provides a basis for objective and testable conclusions\n    - C: It is a faster and more efficient method than experimentation\n    - D: It is a more subjective and intuitive approach\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What was the significance of Nicolas Steno's contributions to geology and evolutionary theory?\n    - A: Steno's work had a minor impact on the development of geology and evolutionary theory\n    - B: Steno's work provided important evidence for the theory of evolution\n    - C: Steno's work laid the groundwork for modern geology and evolutionary theory\n    - D: Steno's work was irrelevant to the development of geology and evolutionary theory\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is empirical evidence important in scientific inquiry?\n    - A: Because it allows scientists to rely on ancient texts and philosophical deductions\n    - B: Because it provides a basis for objective and testable conclusions\n    - C: Because it is a faster and more efficient method than experimentation\n    - D: Because it is a more subjective and intuitive approach\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What was Nicolas Steno's background before becoming an anatomist?\n    - A: He was the son of a goldsmith\n    - B: He was a philosopher\n    - C: He was a theologian\n    - D: He was a physician\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) What was the significance of Nicolas Steno's discovery of the duct in animal skulls?\n    - A: It provided evidence for the existence of ancient humans\n    - B: It supported the idea of a young Earth\n    - C: It helped understand the function of the pineal gland\n    - D: It showed that animals have a similar anatomy to humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) How did Nicolas Steno's work influence Charles Darwin?\n    - A: Darwin was not influenced by Steno's work\n    - B: Darwin used Steno's principles of stratigraphy to develop his theory of evolution\n    - C: Darwin was inspired by Steno's empirical approach to science\n    - D: Darwin disagreed with Steno's views on the age of the Earth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some minor changes to the questions to enhance clarity and conciseness. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, so the refined questions are similar to the initial questions."
