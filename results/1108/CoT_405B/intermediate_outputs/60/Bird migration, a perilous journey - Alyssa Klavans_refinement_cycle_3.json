A: 1 billion\n    - B: 5 billion\n    - C: 10 billion\n    - D: 20 billion\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) How do song birds prepare for their long migrations?\n    - A: By reducing their food intake to conserve energy\n    - B: By gorging on food to increase their weight and survive the journey\n    - C: By changing their migration route to avoid obstacles\n    - D: By delaying their migration to avoid harsh weather\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is one of the primary ways human land development affects migrating song birds?\n    - A: By creating more food sources for the birds\n    - B: By altering stop-over sites and creating dangers such as pesticide ingestion and habitat loss\n    - C: By reducing the number of predators that threaten the birds\n    - D: By changing the birds' migration patterns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more concise:\n4) How does human land development primarily affect migrating song birds?\n    - A: By creating more food sources\n    - B: By altering habitats and creating dangers\n    - C: By reducing predators\n    - D: By changing migration patterns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one way to support migrating birds in urban and suburban areas?\n    - A: By creating more buildings and infrastructure\n    - B: By using pesticides to control insect populations\n    - C: By creating bird-friendly habitats, such as green spaces and bird feeders\n    - D: By reducing green spaces\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) How can individuals make a difference in reducing the impact of pesticides on bird populations?\n    - A: By using more pesticides in their gardens\n    - B: By using natural, plant-based products and implementing sustainable farming practices\n    - C: By creating more urban development\n    - D: By reducing their use of natural pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between human land development and the decline of bird populations?\n    - A: Human land development has no impact on bird populations\n    - B: Human land development is the primary cause of the decline of bird populations\n    - C: Human land development is one of the factors contributing to the decline of bird populations\n    - D: The decline of bird populations is causing human land development\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the potential impact of the loss of bird populations on the ecosystem?\n    - A: It would have no significant impact\n    - B: It would lead to an increase in insect populations and a decrease in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - C: It would lead to a decrease in insect populations and an increase in pollination and seed dispersal\n    - D: It would have a positive impact on the ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more concise:\n8) What would be the likely impact of losing bird populations on the ecosystem?\n    - A: No significant impact\n    - B: Increased insect populations and decreased pollination and seed dispersal\n    - C: Decreased insect populations and increased pollination and seed dispersal\n    - D: Positive impact\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is one way to combine sustainable land development and bird conservation to protect migrating birds?\n    - A: By creating more urban development and using pesticides\n    - B: By integrating bird-friendly design principles into urban planning and creating green spaces\n    - C: By reducing green spaces and using more pesticides\n    - D: By creating more buildings and infrastructure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is one potential strategy to reduce bird collisions with buildings and other structures?\n    - A: By using more glass and reflective surfaces\n    - B: By developing new technologies or strategies, such as using non-reflective materials or designing bird-friendly buildings\n    - C: By creating more urban development and using pesticides\n    - D: By reducing green spaces and using more pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is one way to assess the effectiveness of current conservation efforts and laws in protecting migrating birds?\n    - A: By evaluating the number of birds that migrate each year\n    - B: By assessing the impact of human land development on bird populations\n    - C: By evaluating the trade-offs between human development and bird conservation, such as monitoring bird deaths and habitat loss\n    - D: By monitoring the number of bird deaths due to building collisions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more concise:\n11) How can we assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts for migrating birds?\n    - A: By counting migrating birds\n    - B: By assessing human land development impact\n    - C: By evaluating trade-offs between development and conservation\n    - D: By monitoring building collision deaths\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it important to protect bird populations and the ecosystem services they provide?\n    - A: Because birds are an important food source for humans\n    - B: Because birds provide important ecosystem services, such as insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal, that maintain a healthy environment\n    - C: Because birds are an important part of the food chain\n    - D: Because birds are a source of entertainment for humans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nOverall, most questions were clear and concise, with plausible but incorrect distractors. Refinements were made to questions 4, 8, and 11 to make the correct answers more concise."
