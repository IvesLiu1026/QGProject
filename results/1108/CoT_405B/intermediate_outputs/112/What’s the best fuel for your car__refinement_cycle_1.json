    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary source of energy in gasoline?\n    - A: Solar power\n    - B: Hydrocarbons\n    - C: Wind energy\n    - D: Biofuels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the transcript, approximately how many people die annually due to air pollution from burning fossil fuels?\n    - A: 1 million\n    - B: 2 million\n    - C: 3 million\n    - D: 4.5 million\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is a significant drawback of gasoline despite its high energy density?\n    - A: High cost\n    - B: Limited availability\n    - C: Environmental damage and health risks\n    - D: Low efficiency\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What condition must be met for electric cars to avoid greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Advanced battery technology\n    - B: Electricity generated without fossil fuels\n    - C: High-speed charging infrastructure\n    - D: Large battery packs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can governments make electric vehicles more affordable and reduce the green premium?\n    - A: Implementing stricter emissions regulations\n    - B: Investing in fossil fuel infrastructure\n    - C: Subsidizing electric vehicles\n    - D: Increasing taxes on electric vehicles\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can innovators do to make green technologies more competitive with fossil fuels?\n    - A: Increase the cost of green technologies\n    - B: Reduce the cost of green technologies\n    - C: Maintain the current cost of green technologies\n    - D: Abandon green technologies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the energy density of gasoline and its environmental drawbacks?\n    - A: The energy density of gasoline reduces its environmental drawbacks.\n    - B: The energy density of gasoline has no impact on its environmental drawbacks.\n    - C: The energy density of gasoline contributes to its environmental drawbacks, but is not the primary cause.\n    - D: The energy density of gasoline is the primary cause of its environmental drawbacks.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a key difference between electric cars and gas-powered cars?\n    - A: Electric cars are less efficient than gas-powered cars.\n    - B: Electric cars have higher upfront costs than gas-powered cars.\n    - C: Electric cars have lower operating costs than gas-powered cars.\n    - D: Electric cars have the same environmental impact as gas-powered cars.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can carbon-neutral fuels be integrated into the existing transportation system?\n    - A: By using carbon-neutral fuels in gas-powered cars and electric cars in urban areas.\n    - B: By using electric cars in urban areas and carbon-neutral fuels in rural areas.\n    - C: By integrating carbon-neutral fuels into existing infrastructure.\n    - D: By abandoning electric cars and focusing on carbon-neutral fuels.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential strategy for reducing the green premium?\n    - A: Increasing the cost of green technologies\n    - B: Integrating green technologies into existing infrastructure\n    - C: Abandoning green technologies\n    - D: Reducing the cost of fossil fuels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a key factor in evaluating the effectiveness of government subsidies in promoting the adoption of electric vehicles?\n    - A: The cost of the subsidies\n    - B: The number of electric vehicles sold\n    - C: The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: The increase in fossil fuel consumption\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a key consideration in evaluating the environmental impact of different fuel options?\n    - A: The cost of the fuel\n    - B: The energy density of the fuel\n    - C: The greenhouse gas emissions associated with the fuel\n    - D: The availability of the fuel\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
