    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and have accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the highest frequency that the greater wax moth can register?\n    - A: 100,000 hertz\n    - B: 200,000 hertz\n    - C: 250,000 hertz\n    - D: 300,000 hertz\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Which type of whales emit sounds around 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals?\n    - A: Toothed whales\n    - B: Baleen whales\n    - C: Sperm whales\n    - D: Humpback whales\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the unique ear structure in owls?\n    - A: To detect high-frequency vibrations\n    - B: To reduce flight sounds\n    - C: To funnel sounds inward and increase sensitivity\n    - D: To detect vibrations through their legs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the main purpose of echolocation in some animals, such as bats and toothed whales?\n    - A: To detect seismic activity\n    - B: To navigate and find prey\n    - C: To detect vibrations through their legs\n    - D: To reduce noise pollution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential application of studying the adaptations of animals that can detect vibrations?\n    - A: Developing new technologies for detecting seismic activity\n    - B: Improving human hearing aids\n    - C: Developing new methods for detecting and tracking wildlife\n    - D: Reducing noise pollution\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How does the ear structure of an animal affect its ability to hear different frequencies?\n    - A: A smaller ear structure is more sensitive to high-frequency vibrations\n    - B: A larger ear structure is more sensitive to low-frequency vibrations\n    - C: A more sensitive ear structure can detect a wider range of frequencies\n    - D: Ear structure has no impact on the range of sounds that can be heard\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the hearing ability of owls compare to that of humans?\n    - A: Owls can hear higher frequencies than humans\n    - B: Owls can hear lower frequencies than humans\n    - C: Owls have a similar range of hearing to humans\n    - D: Owls are less sensitive to sound waves than humans\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is a unique feature of the ogre-faced spider's ability to detect sound?\n    - A: It uses its ears to detect sound waves\n    - B: It uses its legs to detect sound waves\n    - C: It can only detect high-frequency vibrations\n    - D: It can only detect low-frequency vibrations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How do baleen whales likely detect the low-frequency sounds they emit?\n    - A: Through their external ears\n    - B: Through their skulls, which conduct the vibrations to their ear bones\n    - C: Through their jawbones, which connect directly to their middle ear bones\n    - D: Through their skin, which is sensitive to vibrations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential impact of noise pollution on wildlife?\n    - A: The disruption of animal communication\n    - B: The reduction of animal populations\n    - C: The alteration of animal behavior\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI removed questions 5, 9, 11, and 12 from the initial set, as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript or were too vague. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. Additionally, I changed the distractors for some questions to make them more plausible but incorrect."
