    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who developed the staining technique known as Golgi's Method in 1873?\n    - A: Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal\n    - B: Camillo Golgi\n    - C: Louis Pasteur\n    - D: Robert Koch\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What did electron microscopy reveal that supported the neuron doctrine?\n    - A: A network of nerve cells connected by a web of tissue\n    - B: A membrane around each nerve cell\n    - C: The absence of electrical impulses in the brain\n    - D: The presence of glial cells in the nervous system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the significance of Golgi's Method in the study of neurons?\n    - A: It allowed researchers to see the entire cell body of neurons\n    - B: It revealed the absence of electrical impulses in the brain\n    - C: It showed that neurons are connected by a web of tissue\n    - D: It demonstrated that neurons are not discrete cells\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the neuron doctrine, and what does it propose?\n    - A: It proposes that the brain's tissue is made up of a single web of tissue\n    - B: It proposes that the brain's tissue is made up of many discrete cells\n    - C: It proposes that electrical signals travel through the body via a linear chain of activation\n    - D: It proposes that neurons are not responsible for transmitting electrical impulses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How is the neuron doctrine applied in understanding how electrical impulses travel through the body?\n    - A: It suggests that electrical signals jump from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation\n    - B: It proposes that electrical signals travel through a web of tissue\n    - C: It demonstrates that neurons are not responsible for transmitting electrical impulses\n    - D: It shows that the brain's tissue is made up of a single cell\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential application of Cajal's hypothesis in modern neuroscience research?\n    - A: Understanding the structure of the spinal cord\n    - B: Developing new treatments for neurological disorders\n    - C: Studying the behavior of glial cells in the nervous system\n    - D: Examining the role of neurotransmitters in synaptic transmission\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between Golgi's Method and Cajal's improvements in revealing new details about neurons?\n    - A: Golgi's Method was replaced by Cajal's improvements\n    - B: Cajal's improvements built upon Golgi's Method to reveal new details\n    - C: Golgi's Method and Cajal's improvements are unrelated\n    - D: Cajal's improvements contradicted the findings of Golgi's Method\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the neuron doctrine contrast with reticular theory in explaining how electrical signals travel through the body?\n    - A: The neuron doctrine proposes a web of tissue, while reticular theory proposes discrete cells\n    - B: The neuron doctrine proposes discrete cells, while reticular theory proposes a web of tissue\n    - C: The neuron doctrine and reticular theory propose the same mechanism\n    - D: The neuron doctrine and reticular theory are unrelated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What was the major limitation of Golgi's Method that Cajal's improvements addressed?\n    - A: Golgi's Method was unable to stain neurons effectively\n    - B: Golgi's Method was unable to reveal the details of neuronal connections\n    - C: Golgi's Method was unable to distinguish between different types of cells\n    - D: Golgi's Method was unable to provide high-resolution images of neurons\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How significant were Golgi's Method and Cajal's improvements in the development of modern neuroscience?\n    - A: They were instrumental in shaping our understanding of the brain and its functions\n    - B: They were minor contributions that had little impact on the field\n    - C: They were only relevant to the study of neurons and not to the broader field of neuroscience\n    - D: They were contradictory findings that hindered the progress of neuroscience\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What are the limitations of reticular theory in explaining how electrical signals travel through the body?\n    - A: It proposes a web of tissue that is not supported by empirical evidence\n    - B: It suggests that electrical signals jump from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation\n    - C: It demonstrates that neurons are not responsible for transmitting electrical impulses\n    - D: It shows that the brain's tissue is made up of a single cell\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) How could the neuron doctrine be integrated with modern neuroscience research to develop new treatments for neurological disorders?\n    - A: By using the neuron doctrine to understand the behavior of neurons and develop targeted treatments\n    - B: By using modern neuroscience research to replace the neuron doctrine\n    - C: By studying the structure of the spinal cord to develop new treatments\n    - D: By examining the role of glial cells in the nervous system to develop new treatments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI have removed questions that were redundant or unclear and rephrased some questions to improve their clarity and concision. I have also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and that the correct answers are accurate."
