    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions as follows:\n\n1) What is the highest frequency that the greater wax moth can register?\n    - A: 200,000 hertz\n    - B: 250,000 hertz\n    - C: 280,000 hertz\n    - D: 300,000 hertz\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Which type of whales emit sounds around 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals?\n    - A: Toothed whales\n    - B: Baleen whales\n    - C: Sperm whales\n    - D: Humpback whales\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the unique ear structure in owls?\n    - A: To detect high-frequency vibrations\n    - B: To reduce flight sounds\n    - C: To funnel sounds inward and increase sensitivity\n    - D: To detect vibrations through their legs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the main purpose of echolocation in some animals, such as bats and toothed whales?\n    - A: To detect seismic activity\n    - B: To navigate and find prey\n    - C: To detect vibrations through their legs\n    - D: To reduce noise pollution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential application of studying the adaptations of animals that can detect vibrations?\n    - A: Developing new technologies for detecting seismic activity\n    - B: Improving human hearing aids\n    - C: Developing new methods for detecting and tracking wildlife\n    - D: Reducing noise pollution\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How does the ear structure of an animal affect its ability to hear different frequencies?\n    - A: A smaller ear structure is more sensitive to high-frequency vibrations\n    - B: A larger ear structure is more sensitive to low-frequency vibrations\n    - C: A more sensitive ear structure can detect a wider range of frequencies\n    - D: Ear structure has no impact on the range of sounds that can be heard\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the hearing ability of owls compare to that of humans?\n    - A: Owls can hear higher frequencies than humans\n    - B: Owls can hear lower frequencies than humans\n    - C: Owls have a similar range of hearing to humans\n    - D: Owls are more sensitive to sound waves than humans\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is a unique feature of the ogre-faced spider's ability to detect sound?\n    - A: It uses its ears to detect sound waves\n    - B: It uses its legs to detect sound waves\n    - C: It can only detect high-frequency vibrations\n    - D: It can only detect low-frequency vibrations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How do baleen whales likely detect the low-frequency sounds they emit?\n    - A: Through their external ears\n    - B: Through their skulls, which conduct the vibrations to their ear bones\n    - C: Through their jawbones, which connect directly to their middle ear bones\n    - D: Through their skin, which is sensitive to vibrations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential impact of studying animal adaptations on our understanding of the natural world?\n    - A: A greater appreciation for the diversity of animal hearing abilities\n    - B: A better understanding of the impact of noise pollution on wildlife\n    - C: The development of new technologies for detecting and tracking wildlife\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made the following changes:\n\n- Refined question 1 to make the distractors more plausible.\n- Changed the correct answer for question 7 to reflect that owls are more sensitive to sound waves than humans, not just able to hear higher frequencies.\n- Changed question 10 to focus on the potential impact of studying animal adaptations on our understanding of the natural world, rather than the impact of noise pollution on wildlife.\n- Made minor changes to the wording of several questions to improve clarity and concision."
