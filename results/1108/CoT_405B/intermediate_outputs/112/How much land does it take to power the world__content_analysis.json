    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Specific facts or details that can be recalled directly):\n\n1. Different power sources require varying amounts of space to generate electricity.\n2. Fossil fuels can produce up to 2,000 watts per square meter.\n3. Nuclear power requires uranium mines, facilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store spent fuel safely.\n4. Renewable energy needs wind turbines or solar panels.\n5. To power a 10-watt light bulb, the space required is:\n   - Fossil fuels: credit card-sized chunk of land\n   - Nuclear power: area about the size of the palms of your hands\n   - Solar power: at least 0.3 square meters (twice the size of a cafeteria tray)\n   - Wind power: roughly 7 square meters (about half the size of a parking space)\n6. The world uses 3 trillion watts of electricity.\n7. Space required to power the entire world with different power sources:\n   - Fossil fuels: at least 1,200 square kilometers (roughly the area of Grand Bahama island)\n   - Nuclear energy: almost four times as much space (roughly 4,000 square kilometers, a little less than the area of Delaware)\n   - Solar: at least 95,000 square kilometers (approximately the area of South Korea)\n   - Wind power: two million square kilometers (about the area of Mexico)\n8. 2/3 of our electricity comes from fossil fuels as of 2020.\n9. Electricity generation is responsible for about 27% of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Comprehension** (Important concepts that require understanding or interpretation):\n\n1.
