All of humanity's artificial satellites suddenly disappear without warning.\n2. TV broadcasts from or routed through satellites dominate the market for international programming and some local channels.\n3. Global positioning, navigation, and timing services (GPS) rely on satellites.\n4. Many machines, including heating and cooling systems, assembly lines, and traffic control systems, rely on satellite-based timing systems.\n5. Satellite-based timestamps play a critical part in financial transactions, credit card readers, and stock exchanges.\n6. A solar flare or an orbital chain reaction of collisions could lead to the same results as the sudden disappearance of satellites.\n7. There are approximately 7,500 metric tons of defunct spacecraft, spent boosters, and discarded equipment orbiting the Earth.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The disappearance of satellites causes immediate disruptions to TV broadcasts, air travel, and global navigation.\n2. The effects of the disappearance are not limited to entertainment and travel, but also impact various machines and systems that rely on satellite-based timing.\n3. The world economy shuts down due to the loss of satellite-based timestamps, leading to a state of emergency and military intervention.\n4. The combination of global positioning and internet has allowed for near-instant signals that can be synchronized worldwide.\n5. Rebuilding communication systems to pre-satellite era technology would be a complex task.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. Pilots, captains, and drivers must use analog instruments and maps to navigate without GPS.\n2. Air traffic controllers must take measures to prevent plane crashes without satellite-based navigation.\n3. Police and good Samaritans must direct traffic to prevent accidents without functioning traffic control systems.\n4. Commanders of nuclear submarines and missile control centers must make decisions with partial information.\n5. Creating backup options for satellite networks and cooperating to avoid an orbital tragedy of the commons can help protect against the consequences of satellite loss.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between satellite technology and modern society is explored, highlighting the dependence on satellites for various systems and services.\n2. The contrast between the pre-satellite era and the current reliance on satellite technology is discussed.\n3. The cause-and-effect connections between the disappearance of satellites and the subsequent disruptions to various systems and services are analyzed.\n4. The potential consequences of a solar flare or an orbital chain reaction of collisions are compared to the sudden disappearance of satellites.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. The idea that satellites have quickly replaced traditional long-range technologies, leading to a dependence on this technology, can be combined with the concept of the orbital tragedy of the commons to form a new understanding of the importance of responsible satellite management.\n2. The notion that space is a finite resource, similar to forests, ocean biodiversity, and clean air, can be combined with the concept of satellite technology to form a new understanding of the need for sustainable space management.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. The decision-making process of commanders of nuclear submarines and missile control centers with partial information can be evaluated for its effectiveness and potential consequences.\n2. The response of governments and military forces to the state of emergency can be evaluated for its effectiveness in restoring order and addressing the consequences of the satellite loss.\n3. The importance of creating backup options for satellite networks and cooperating to avoid an orbital tragedy of the commons can be evaluated in terms of its potential to mitigate the consequences of satellite loss.\n4. The comparison between the pre-satellite era and the current reliance on satellite technology can be evaluated in terms of its implications for the future of communication and navigation systems."
