    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who was the first woman to win the Fields Medal?\n    - A: Maryam Mirzakhani\n    - B: Emmy Noether\n    - C: Sophie Germain\n    - D: Hypatia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What percentage of the population is estimated to suffer from math anxiety?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: 30%\n    - D: 40%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What can contribute to the development of math anxiety in children?\n    - A: The way children are exposed to math by their parents and teachers\n    - B: The child's natural ability to understand math concepts\n    - C: The amount of homework assigned to the child\n    - D: The child's learning style\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the distractors more plausible.\n\n4) What can happen to individuals who have mastered basic math skills but experience math anxiety?\n    - A: They will always perform well in math\n    - B: They may struggle with even basic math skills\n    - C: They will never experience math anxiety again\n    - D: They will become more confident in their math abilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the question more concise and the distractors more plausible.\n\n5) A student is experiencing math anxiety and wants to improve their test performance. What strategy can they try?\n    - A: Studying for longer periods of time\n    - B: Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises\n    - C: Asking a friend to take the test for them\n    - D: Avoiding math problems altogether\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) How can teachers help build their students' confidence and numerical skills?\n    - A: By using playful and creative approaches to math\n    - B: By assigning more homework and giving more tests\n    - C: By lecturing for longer periods of time\n    - D: By using traditional teaching methods\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the question more concise.\n\n7) What is the relationship between math anxiety and working memory?\n    - A: Math anxiety increases working memory\n    - B: Math anxiety decreases working memory\n    - C: Math anxiety has no impact on working memory\n    - D: Working memory has no impact on math anxiety\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the relationship between math anxiety and math ability?\n    - A: Having math anxiety means someone is bad at math\n    - B: Having math anxiety means someone is good at math\n    - C: Having math anxiety does not necessarily mean someone is bad at math\n    - D: Having math anxiety is unrelated to math ability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What combination of strategies can help individuals overcome math anxiety and improve their math performance?\n    - A: Relaxation techniques and a fixed mindset\n    - B: Relaxation techniques and a growth mindset\n    - C: A growth mindset and avoiding math problems\n    - D: A fixed mindset and practicing math for longer periods of time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) How can teachers create a supportive environment to help students build confidence and numerical skills?\n    - A: By using a combination of playful and creative approaches to math, along with providing a supportive and encouraging environment\n    - B: By assigning more homework and giving more tests\n    - C: By lecturing for longer periods of time and using traditional teaching methods\n    - D: By avoiding math problems altogether\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the question more concise.\n\n11) How effective are relaxation techniques in alleviating math anxiety?\n    - A: Relaxation techniques are always effective in alleviating math anxiety\n    - B: Relaxation techniques can be effective in alleviating math anxiety\n    - C: Relaxation techniques are rarely effective in alleviating math anxiety\n    - D: Relaxation techniques are never effective in alleviating math anxiety\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the question more concise and the distractors more plausible.\n\n12) What is the impact of societal expectations on math anxiety?\n    - A: Societal expectations have no impact on math anxiety\n    - B: Societal expectations can contribute to math anxiety\n    - C: Societal expectations can alleviate math anxiety\n    - D: Societal expectations are the sole cause of math anxiety\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed."
