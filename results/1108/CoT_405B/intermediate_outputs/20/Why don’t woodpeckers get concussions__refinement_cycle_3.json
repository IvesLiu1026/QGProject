    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) At what rate do woodpeckers hammer trees?\n    - A: 10 times per second\n    - B: 20 times per second\n    - C: 50 times per second\n    - D: 100 times per second\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the brain disease caused by repeated impacts?\n    - A: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n    - B: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)\n    - C: Concussion Syndrome\n    - D: Impact-Related Brain Disease (IRBD)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary reason why woodpeckers can withstand headbanging without getting concussions?\n    - A: Because they have spongy skull bones and special eyelids that help absorb shock\n    - B: Because they have a strong neck that helps to distribute the force of the impact\n    - C: Because the small size and mass of their brain reduce the impact of deceleration\n    - D: Because they have a unique beak shape and structure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration in impact injury?\n    - A: Force equals mass divided by acceleration\n    - B: Force equals mass times acceleration\n    - C: Force equals acceleration divided by mass\n    - D: Force equals mass plus acceleration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does the concept of g-force relate to impact injury?\n    - A: G-force is a measure of the force of the impact\n    - B: G-force is a measure of the mass of the object involved in the impact\n    - C: G-force is a measure of the acceleration of the object involved in the impact\n    - D: G-force is a measure of the relative acceleration of the object involved in the impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is the main difference between the anatomy of woodpeckers and humans that makes woodpeckers less susceptible to concussions?\n    - A: Woodpeckers have a harder skull than humans\n    - B: Woodpeckers have spongy skull bones and special eyelids that help absorb shock\n    - C: Woodpeckers have a smaller brain than humans\n    - D: Woodpeckers have a stronger neck than humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) A company is trying to develop a new safety helmet for cyclists. Which of the following approaches would be most effective?\n    - A: Using a hard outer shell to protect the head\n    - B: Using a soft, padded interior to absorb shock\n    - C: Applying the principles of woodpecker anatomy to develop a helmet that can absorb shock\n    - D: Using a combination of hard and soft materials to create a helmet that can absorb and distribute the force of the impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) According to the concept of scaling, what happens to the volume and mass of an object as it gets smaller?\n    - A: They decrease by the square\n    - B: They decrease by the cube\n    - C: They increase by the square\n    - D: They increase by the cube\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed question 8 from the initial set and replaced it with a new question that is more relevant to the transcript and the concept of scaling. I also refined some of the questions to make them more concise and clear. No more refinement needed."
