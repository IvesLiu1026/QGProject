    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Approximately how many plant species have evolved to be carnivorous?\n    - A: Over 100\n    - B: Over 600\n    - C: Over 1,000\n    - D: Over 2,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the powerful narcotic found in the nectar of some pitcher plants?\n    - A: Mucilage\n    - B: Coniine\n    - C: Digestive enzyme\n    - D: Adhesive substance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why have some plants evolved to obtain essential nutrients from insects and other prey?\n    - A: Because they grow in areas with highly alkaline soil\n    - B: Because they grow in areas with highly acidic soil that lacks essential nutrients\n    - C: Because they have a high demand for nutrients\n    - D: Because they have a low demand for nutrients\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is unique about the features of carnivorous plants, such as traps and digestive enzymes?\n    - A: They allow the plants to capture and digest other plants\n    - B: They allow the plants to capture and digest prey\n    - C: They allow the plants to absorb nutrients from the soil\n    - D: They allow the plants to produce nectar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can the study of carnivorous plants inform us about?\n    - A: The diversity of animal species\n    - B: The diversity of plant species and their adaptations to different environments\n    - C: The importance of soil nutrients\n    - D: The evolution of animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How do carnivorous plants typically obtain essential nutrients in environments with poor soil quality?\n    - A: By developing deeper roots to access more nutrients\n    - B: By producing more chlorophyll to increase photosynthesis\n    - C: By capturing and digesting prey\n    - D: By forming symbiotic relationships with other plants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is a potential application of the study of carnivorous plants?\n    - A: Developing new technologies for capturing and digesting organic matter\n    - B: Developing new technologies for absorbing nutrients from the soil\n    - C: Developing new technologies for producing nectar\n    - D: Developing new technologies for studying animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How did the environment influence the evolution of carnivorous plants?\n    - A: The environment had no impact on the evolution of carnivorous plants\n    - B: The environment led to the development of carnivory in plants due to the lack of essential nutrients in the soil\n    - C: The environment led to the development of carnivory in plants due to the abundance of essential nutrients in the soil\n    - D: The environment led to the development of carnivory in plants due to the presence of other carnivorous plants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the relationship between the capture of prey and the provision of essential nutrients to the plant?\n    - A: The capture of prey has no effect on the provision of essential nutrients to the plant\n    - B: The capture of prey provides essential nutrients to the plant, allowing it to thrive\n    - C: The capture of prey provides non-essential nutrients to the plant, having no impact on its survival\n    - D: The capture of prey provides essential nutrients to other plants in the environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What type of evolution is exemplified by the development of carnivory in plants?\n    - A: Divergent evolution\n    - B: Convergent evolution\n    - C: Parallel evolution\n    - D: Co-evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is it important to study carnivorous plants in understanding the evolution of unique adaptations?\n    - A: Because they are the only plants that have evolved carnivory\n    - B: Because they provide insights into the evolution of unique adaptations in response to environmental pressures\n    - C: Because they are the most efficient plants at capturing and digesting prey\n    - D: Because they are the most diverse group of plants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential limitation of using carnivorous plant technology in real-world scenarios?\n    - A: It is too expensive to implement\n    - B: It is too complex to understand\n    - C: It may not be scalable or efficient in certain environments\n    - D: It is not necessary to use carnivorous plant technology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions that were duplicates or not aligned with the key concepts. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. The distractors were revised to be plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers were verified for accuracy."
