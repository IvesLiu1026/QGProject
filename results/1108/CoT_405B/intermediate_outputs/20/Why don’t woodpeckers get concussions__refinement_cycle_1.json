    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) At what rate do woodpeckers hammer trees?\n    - A: 10 times per second\n    - B: 20 times per second\n    - C: 50 times per second\n    - D: 100 times per second\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the brain disease caused by repeated impacts?\n    - A: Concussion Syndrome\n    - B: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)\n    - C: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n    - D: Impact-Related Brain Disease (IRBD)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why are woodpeckers able to withstand headbanging without getting concussions?\n    - A: Because they have a hard skull that protects their brain\n    - B: Because they have spongy skull bones, special eyelids, and a hyoid bone that helps absorb shock\n    - C: Because they have a small brain that is less susceptible to damage due to its size and mass\n    - D: Because they have a strong neck that helps to distribute the force of the impact\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration in impact injury?\n    - A: Force equals mass divided by acceleration\n    - B: Force equals mass times acceleration\n    - C: Force equals acceleration divided by mass\n    - D: Force equals mass plus acceleration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A football player is trying to reduce their risk of getting a concussion. Which of the following strategies would be most effective?\n    - A: Wearing a helmet with a hard outer shell\n    - B: Wearing a helmet with a soft, padded interior\n    - C: Using a mouthguard to protect their teeth\n    - D: Applying the principles of woodpecker anatomy to develop a helmet that can absorb shock\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) A car manufacturer is trying to design a safer airbag system. Which of the following equations would be most relevant to their design?\n    - A: Force equals mass divided by acceleration\n    - B: Force equals mass times acceleration\n    - C: Force equals acceleration divided by mass\n    - D: Force equals mass plus acceleration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the main difference between the anatomy of woodpeckers and humans that makes woodpeckers less susceptible to concussions?\n    - A: Woodpeckers have a harder skull than humans\n    - B: Woodpeckers have spongy skull bones, special eyelids, and a hyoid bone that helps absorb shock\n    - C: Woodpeckers have a smaller brain than humans\n    - D: Woodpeckers have a stronger neck than humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does the concept of g-force relate to impact injury?\n    - A: G-force is a measure of the force of the impact\n    - B: G-force is a measure of the mass of the object involved in the impact\n    - C: G-force is a measure of the acceleration of the object involved in the impact\n    - D: G-force is a measure of the relative acceleration of the object involved in the impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) A company is trying to develop a new safety helmet for cyclists. Which of the following approaches would be most effective?\n    - A: Using a hard outer shell to protect the head\n    - B: Using a soft, padded interior to absorb shock\n    - C: Applying the principles of woodpecker anatomy to develop a helmet that can absorb shock\n    - D: Using a combination of hard and soft materials to create a helmet that can absorb and distribute the force of the impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the primary reason why woodpeckers are able to withstand high-impact forces without getting concussions?\n    - A: Because of their spongy skull bones and special eyelids\n    - B: Because of their strong neck and shoulder muscles\n    - C: Because of the small size and mass of their brain\n    - D: Because of their unique beak shape and structure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they seemed redundant and not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript.\n\nLet me know if further refinement is necessary."
