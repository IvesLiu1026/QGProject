    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What materials were used to make the earliest golf balls?\n    - A: Wood, hair, feathers, and gutta percha\n    - B: Rubber, metal, and plastic\n    - C: Leather and synthetic materials\n    - D: Only wood and hair\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) By how many yards has the average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour increased since 1980?\n    - A: 10-20 yards\n    - B: 20-30 yards\n    - C: Over 30 yards\n    - D: 40-50 yards\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What factors have contributed to the increase in driving distance in golf?\n    - A: Increased strength and high-tech clubs\n    - B: Better course conditions and ball design\n    - C: A combination of increased strength, high-tech clubs, and better course conditions\n    - D: Improved ball manufacturing techniques only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What concern has arisen due to the rise in driving distance in golf?\n    - A: Players are hitting the ball too short\n    - B: Players can now fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult\n    - C: Players are hitting the ball too straight\n    - D: Players are hitting the ball too high\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How do dimples on a golf ball affect its flight?\n    - A: They create more drag, reducing distance\n    - B: They create a protective layer of turbulence, increasing distance\n    - C: They have no effect on distance\n    - D: They only affect accuracy, not distance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can course designers adapt to the increased driving distance in golf?\n    - A: Make courses shorter\n    - B: Make courses longer\n    - C: Redesign courses to account for increased driving distance\n    - D: Leave courses unchanged\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the introduction of solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1 and the rise in driving distance?\n    - A: The rise in driving distance led to the introduction of solid multi-layer balls\n    - B: The introduction of solid multi-layer balls contributed to the rise in driving distance\n    - C: There is no relationship between the rise in driving distance and the introduction of solid multi-layer balls\n    - D: The rise in driving distance and the introduction of solid multi-layer balls are unrelated factors that happened coincidentally\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential drawback of the increased driving distance in golf?\n    - A: More exciting gameplay\n    - B: Increased accuracy\n    - C: Making courses obsolete\n    - D: Reduced cost of golf balls\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a benefit of the Pro V1 golf ball?\n    - A: Increased cost\n    - B: Decreased accuracy\n    - C: Increased distance and accuracy\n    - D: Reduced durability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What could be a potential solution to the problem of increased driving distance in golf?\n    - A: Making golf balls smaller and lighter\n    - B: Making golf balls bigger and heavier\n    - C: Implementing rule changes to limit driving distance\n    - D: Leaving the game unchanged\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why are golf officials considering changes to the game?\n    - A: To increase driving distance\n    - B: To decrease driving distance\n    - C: To improve accuracy\n    - D: To reduce costs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How can golf courses adapt to the increased driving distance without changing the rules of the game?\n    - A: By making the course shorter\n    - B: By making the course longer\n    - C: By redesigning the course to account for increased driving distance\n    - D: By purchasing adjacent land to extend the course\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made some minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some of the questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
