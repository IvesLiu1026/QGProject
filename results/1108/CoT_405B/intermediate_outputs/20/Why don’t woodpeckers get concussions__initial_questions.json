    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the rate at which woodpeckers hammer trees?\n    - A: 10 times per second\n    - B: 20 times per second\n    - C: 50 times per second\n    - D: 100 times per second\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the brain disease caused by repeated impacts?\n    - A: Concussion Syndrome\n    - B: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)\n    - C: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n    - D: Impact-Related Brain Disease (IRBD)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) Why are woodpeckers able to withstand headbanging without getting concussions?\n    - A: Because they have a hard skull that protects their brain\n    - B: Because they have spongy skull bones, special eyelids, and a hyoid bone that helps absorb shock\n    - C: Because they have a small brain that is less susceptible to damage\n    - D: Because they have a strong neck that helps to distribute the force of the impact\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration in impact injury?\n    - A: Force equals mass divided by acceleration\n    - B: Force equals mass times acceleration\n    - C: Force equals acceleration divided by mass\n    - D: Force equals mass plus acceleration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A football player is trying to reduce their risk of getting a concussion. Which of the following strategies would be most effective?\n    - A: Wearing a helmet with a hard outer shell\n    - B: Wearing a helmet with a soft, padded interior\n    - C: Using a mouthguard to protect their teeth\n    - D: Applying the principles of woodpecker anatomy to develop a helmet that can absorb shock\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A car manufacturer is trying to design a safer airbag system. Which of the following equations would be most relevant to their design?\n    - A: Force equals mass divided by acceleration\n    - B: Force equals mass times acceleration\n    - C: Force equals acceleration divided by mass\n    - D: Force equals mass plus acceleration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the main difference between the anatomy of woodpeckers and humans that makes woodpeckers less susceptible to concussions?\n    - A: Woodpeckers have a harder skull than humans\n    - B: Woodpeckers have spongy skull bones, special eyelids, and a hyoid bone that helps absorb shock\n    - C: Woodpeckers have a smaller brain than humans\n    - D: Woodpeckers have a stronger neck than humans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the concept of g-force relate to impact injury?\n    - A: G-force is a measure of the force of the impact\n    - B: G-force is a measure of the mass of the object involved in the impact\n    - C: G-force is a measure of the acceleration of the object involved in the impact\n    - D: G-force is a measure of the relative acceleration of the object involved in the impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) A company is trying to develop a new safety helmet for cyclists. Which of the following approaches would be most effective?\n    - A: Using a hard outer shell to protect the head\n    - B: Using a soft, padded interior to absorb shock\n    - C: Applying the principles of woodpecker anatomy to develop a helmet that can absorb shock\n    - D: Using a combination of hard and soft materials to create a helmet that can absorb and distribute the force of the impact\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) A researcher is trying to develop a new material that can withstand impact. Which of the following approaches would be most effective?\n    - A: Using a combination of hard and soft materials to create a material that can absorb and distribute the force of the impact\n    - B: Using a material with a high density to absorb the force of the impact\n    - C: Using a material with a low density to distribute the force of the impact\n    - D: Applying the principles of woodpecker anatomy to develop a material that can absorb shock\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) A new safety helmet has been developed that uses the principles of woodpecker anatomy to absorb shock. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true?\n    - A: The helmet is more effective at preventing concussions than traditional helmets\n    - B: The helmet is less effective at preventing concussions than traditional helmets\n    - C: The helmet is equally effective at preventing concussions as traditional helmets\n    - D: There is not enough data to determine the effectiveness of the helmet\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of a new safety protocol for preventing concussions in sports. Which of the following criteria would be most important to consider?\n    - A: The cost of implementing the protocol\n    - B: The ease of implementing the protocol\n    - C: The effectiveness of the protocol in reducing the risk of concussions\n    - D: The potential risks and benefits of the protocol\n[Correct answer]: D"
