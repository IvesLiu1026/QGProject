    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What are the three species of Wuddly creatures that can be obtained through egg fusion?\n    - A: Cuddly, Fluffy, and Fuddly\n    - B: Cuddly, Duddly, and Fuddly\n    - C: Wuddly, Duddly, and Fuddly\n    - D: Cuddly, Fluffy, and Wuddly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many eggs are required to make a single Wuddly animal through the process of egg fusion?\n    - A: 50 eggs\n    - B: 75 eggs\n    - C: 100 eggs\n    - D: 150 eggs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary goal of the egg fusion process in the context of the Wuddly species?\n    - A: To create a new species of Wuddly creatures\n    - B: To determine the number of eggs needed for fusion\n    - C: To understand the relationship between egg colors\n    - D: To produce a single egg of a specific color that will hatch into a desired Wuddly creature\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What happens to the number of eggs of each color during the egg fusion process?\n    - A: The number of eggs of each color remains the same\n    - B: The number of eggs of each color changes randomly\n    - C: The number of eggs of each color decreases by half\n    - D: The number of eggs of each color changes parity (evenness or oddness) simultaneously\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) If you have an incubator with 23 blue, 33 purple, and 43 red eggs, and you want to adopt a Cuddly, what color egg should you add to the incubator?\n    - A: Blue egg\n    - B: Purple egg\n    - C: Red egg\n    - D: Green egg\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) If you have an incubator with 20 blue, 30 purple, and 40 red eggs, and you want to get a Duddly, what color egg should you add?\n    - A: Blue egg\n    - B: Purple egg\n    - C: Red egg\n    - D: Yellow egg\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the egg colors and the resulting Wuddly creature?\n    - A: Blue eggs produce Duddly, purple eggs produce Cuddly, and red eggs produce Fuddly\n    - B: Blue eggs produce Cuddly, purple eggs produce Duddly, and red eggs produce Fuddly\n    - C: Blue eggs produce Fuddly, purple eggs produce Cuddly, and red eggs produce Duddly\n    - D: The relationship is random and unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between adding an egg of a specific color and the final egg color?\n    - A: Adding a blue egg results in a purple egg, adding a purple egg results in a red egg, and adding a red egg results in a blue egg\n    - B: Adding a blue egg results in a blue egg, adding a purple egg results in a purple egg, and adding a red egg results in a red egg, due to parity changes\n    - C: Adding a blue egg results in a red egg, adding a purple egg results in a blue egg, and adding a red egg results in a purple egg\n    - D: The connection is random and unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) Combining the rules of egg fusion with the initial egg distribution (23 blue, 33 purple, 43 red), what is the correct color egg to add to get a Cuddly?\n    - A: Blue egg\n    - B: Purple egg\n    - C: Red egg\n    - D: Green egg\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) Using the concept of parity (evenness or oddness), what is the key insight to determine the correct color egg to add?\n    - A: The number of eggs of each color must be even\n    - B: The number of eggs of each color must be odd\n    - C: The parity of the number of eggs of each color changes simultaneously during egg fusion\n    - D: The parity of the number of eggs of each color remains the same during egg fusion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Justify the decision to add a blue egg to the incubator based on the rules of egg fusion and the desired outcome. Which of the following statements is correct?\n    - A: Adding a blue egg is the only possible solution to get a Cuddly\n    - B: Adding a blue egg is the most likely solution to get a Cuddly, but other options are possible\n    - C: Adding a blue egg is a possible solution to get a Cuddly, but it is not the only option\n    - D: Adding a blue egg is not a viable solution to get a Cuddly\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy used to determine the correct color egg to add. Which of the following statements is correct?\n    - A: The strategy is effective because it takes into account the rules of egg fusion and the initial egg distribution\n    - B: The strategy is effective because it relies on random chance and luck\n    - C: The strategy is ineffective because it does not consider the rules of egg fusion\n    - D: The strategy is ineffective because it does not consider the initial egg distribution\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
