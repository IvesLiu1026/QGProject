    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many cells make up the human body?\n    - A: 10 trillion\n    - B: 30 trillion\n    - C: 50 trillion\n    - D: 100 trillion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What are the four chemical letters that make up DNA?\n    - A: A, C, T, and U\n    - B: A, C, T, and G\n    - C: A, G, C, and D\n    - D: T, A, G, and C\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the result of the immune system's inability to recognize and destroy rogue cells?\n    - A: Genetic variation\n    - B: Evolution\n    - C: Immunotherapy\n    - D: Cancer\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is CAR T-cell therapy, and how does it work?\n    - A: It's a type of chemotherapy that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer.\n    - B: It's a type of immunotherapy that reprograms a patient's own T-cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells.\n    - C: It's a type of radiation therapy that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer.\n    - D: It's a type of surgery that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What type of blood cancer has shown significant improvement in treatment outcomes using CAR T-cell therapy?\n    - A: Acute myeloid leukemia\n    - B: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n    - C: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n    - D: Chronic myeloid leukemia\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can understanding the immune system help us develop new treatments for diseases like cancer?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for chemotherapy\n    - B: By developing new surgical techniques\n    - C: By designing new genetic code to reprogram T-cells\n    - D: By improving our understanding of how the immune system works and how it can be used to fight cancer\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between genetic variation and evolution in understanding how cancer develops?\n    - A: Genetic variation leads to evolution, which leads to cancer.\n    - B: Evolution leads to genetic variation, which leads to cancer.\n    - C: Genetic variation and evolution are unrelated to cancer development.\n    - D: The relationship between genetic variation and evolution is crucial in understanding how cancer develops, as genetic errors can lead to cancer.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) Why does the immune system have a hard time recognizing internal cancer cells?\n    - A: The immune system is too weak to recognize internal cancer cells.\n    - B: The immune system is too strong and recognizes internal cancer cells as healthy cells.\n    - C: The immune system has a hard time recognizing internal cancer cells because they have similar antigens to healthy cells.\n    - D: The immune system is unable to recognize internal cancer cells due to a lack of genetic variation.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential outcome of combining genetic engineering and immunotherapy in cancer treatment?\n    - A: The development of new and innovative treatments for cancer\n    - B: The improvement of existing treatments for cancer\n    - C: The reduction of side effects associated with cancer treatment\n    - D: The increase in cost of cancer treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can the effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapy be evaluated in treating certain types of cancer?\n    - A: By looking at patient survival rates and remission rates\n    - B: By looking at the cost of treatment\n    - C: By looking at the accessibility of treatment\n    - D: By looking at the potential risks and benefits of treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential consideration when evaluating the ethics of genetic engineering in cancer treatment?\n    - A: The potential risks and benefits of treatment\n    - B: The cost and accessibility of treatment\n    - C: The effectiveness of treatment in improving patient outcomes\n    - D: The potential impact on healthcare systems and society as a whole\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a benefit of CAR T-cell therapy compared to traditional cancer treatments?\n    - A: It is less expensive than traditional treatments\n    - B: It is more effective at treating solid tumors\n    - C: It stays in the patient's bloodstream for years, providing ongoing treatment\n    - D: It has fewer side effects than traditional treatments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and concision. I also rephrased question 12 to better align with the transcript and to provide a more accurate comparison between CAR T-cell therapy and traditional cancer treatments."
