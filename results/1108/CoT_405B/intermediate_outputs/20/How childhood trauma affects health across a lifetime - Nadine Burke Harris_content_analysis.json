The CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered a correlation between childhood trauma and increased risk of seven out of 10 leading causes of death in the US.\n2. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (ACEs) was conducted by Dr. Vince Felitti and Dr. Bob Anda.\n3. ACEs include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; physical or emotional neglect; parental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration; parental separation or divorce; or domestic violence.\n4. The study found that 67% of the population had at least one ACE, and 12.6% had four or more ACEs.\n5. The higher the ACE score, the worse the health outcomes.\n6. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is the brain's and body's stress response system.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Childhood trauma affects brain development, the immune system, hormonal systems, and even the way DNA is read and transcribed.\n2. The ACEs study found a dose-response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes.\n3. The study's findings suggest that childhood trauma is a major public health issue.\n4. The speaker's experience working with patients in Bayview-Hunters Point led them to realize that many kids were being misdiagnosed with ADHD when they had actually experienced trauma.\n5. The speaker's understanding of the science behind ACEs changed their approach to treating patients.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The speaker describes how they use the ACEs study to inform their clinical practice, including routine screening and multidisciplinary treatment teams.\n2. The speaker suggests that understanding the science behind ACEs can help doctors and healthcare professionals provide better care for patients.\n3. The speaker describes how the Center for Youth Wellness in San Francisco is working to prevent, screen, and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.\n4. The speaker suggests that addressing ACEs and toxic stress will require a public health approach, similar to how the US has addressed other public health issues like tobacco and lead poisoning.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The speaker notes that some people may dismiss the ACEs study's findings as simply a result of \"bad behavior,\" but the science suggests that there are real neurologic reasons why people exposed to trauma are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior.\n2. The speaker suggests that the ACEs study's findings have implications for how we understand the relationship between childhood trauma and adult health outcomes.\n3. The speaker notes that the study's findings are not just relevant to kids in low-income neighborhoods, but to people from all walks of life.\n4. The speaker suggests that the US has a strong track record of addressing public health issues, but that addressing ACEs and toxic stress will require determination and commitment.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The speaker suggests that understanding the science behind ACEs can help us develop new approaches to treating patients and addressing public health issues.\n2. The speaker notes that the ACEs study's findings have implications for how we think about the relationship between childhood trauma and adult health outcomes.\n3. The speaker suggests that addressing ACEs and toxic stress will require a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates healthcare, education, and social services.\n4. The speaker notes that the US has the potential to make significant progress in addressing ACEs and toxic stress, but that it will require a commitment to understanding the science and developing effective solutions.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The speaker argues that the ACEs study's findings are a \"wake-up call\" for the medical community and society as a whole.\n2. The speaker suggests that the US has a moral obligation to address ACEs and toxic stress, given the significant impact on public health.\n3. The speaker notes that addressing ACEs and toxic stress will require a significant investment of resources, but that it is a necessary step to improve public health.\n4. The speaker argues that the benefits of addressing ACEs and toxic stress far outweigh the costs, and that it is a critical step towards creating a healthier and more equitable society."
