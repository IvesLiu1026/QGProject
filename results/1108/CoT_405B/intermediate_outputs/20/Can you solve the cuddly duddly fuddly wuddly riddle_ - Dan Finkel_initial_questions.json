    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) What are the three species of Wuddly creatures?\n    - A: Cuddly, Duddly, and Fluffy\n    - B: Cuddly, Duddly, and Fuddly\n    - C: Wuddly, Duddly, and Fuddly\n    - D: Cuddly, Fluffy, and Wuddly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many eggs does it take to make a single Wuddly animal through egg fusion?\n    - A: 50 eggs\n    - B: 75 eggs\n    - C: 100 eggs\n    - D: 150 eggs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) What is the goal of the egg fusion process in the context of the Wuddly species?\n    - A: To produce a single egg of a specific color\n    - B: To create a new species of Wuddly creatures\n    - C: To determine the number of eggs needed for fusion\n    - D: To understand the relationship between egg colors\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What happens to the number of eggs of each color during egg fusion?\n    - A: The number of eggs of each color remains the same\n    - B: The number of eggs of each color changes randomly\n    - C: The number of eggs of each color changes parity (evenness or oddness) simultaneously\n    - D: The number of eggs of each color decreases by half\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A person wants to adopt a Cuddly and has an incubator with 23 blue, 33 purple, and 43 red eggs. What color egg should they add to the incubator to achieve this?\n    - A: Blue egg\n    - B: Purple egg\n    - C: Red egg\n    - D: Green egg\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) If you have an incubator with 20 blue, 30 purple, and 40 red eggs, and you want to get a Duddly, what color egg should you add?\n    - A: Blue egg\n    - B: Purple egg\n    - C: Red egg\n    - D: Yellow egg\n[Correct answer]: B (Note: This question requires applying the rules of egg fusion, but the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the content analysis. Based on the rules provided, adding a purple egg would result in a purple egg, which corresponds to a Duddly.)\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the egg colors and the resulting creature?\n    - A: Blue eggs produce Duddly, purple eggs produce Cuddly, and red eggs produce Fuddly\n    - B: Blue eggs produce Cuddly, purple eggs produce Duddly, and red eggs produce Fuddly\n    - C: Blue eggs produce Fuddly, purple eggs produce Cuddly, and red eggs produce Duddly\n    - D: The relationship is random and unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between adding an egg of a specific color and the final egg color?\n    - A: Adding a blue egg results in a purple egg, adding a purple egg results in a red egg, and adding a red egg results in a blue egg\n    - B: Adding a blue egg results in a blue egg, adding a purple egg results in a purple egg, and adding a red egg results in a red egg\n    - C: Adding a blue egg results in a red egg, adding a purple egg results in a blue egg, and adding a red egg results in a purple egg\n    - D: The connection is random and unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) Combining the rules of egg fusion with the initial egg distribution (23 blue, 33 purple, 43 red), what is the correct color egg to add to get a Cuddly?\n    - A: Blue egg\n    - B: Purple egg\n    - C: Red egg\n    - D: Green egg\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Using the concept of parity (evenness or oddness), what is the key insight to determine the correct color egg to add?\n    - A: The number of eggs of each color must be even\n    - B: The number of eggs of each color must be odd\n    - C: The parity of the number of eggs of each color changes simultaneously during egg fusion\n    - D: The parity of the number of eggs of each color remains the same during egg fusion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) Justify the decision to add a blue egg to the incubator based on the rules of egg fusion and the desired outcome. Which of the following statements is correct?\n    - A: Adding a blue egg is the only possible solution to get a Cuddly\n    - B: Adding a blue egg is the most likely solution to get a Cuddly, but other options are possible\n    - C: Adding a blue egg is a possible solution to get a Cuddly, but it is not the only option\n    - D: Adding a blue egg is not a viable solution to get a Cuddly\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy used to determine the correct color egg to add. Which of the following statements is correct?\n    - A: The strategy is effective because it takes into account the rules of egg fusion and the initial egg distribution\n    - B: The strategy is effective because it relies on random chance and luck\n    - C: The strategy is ineffective because it does not consider the rules of egg fusion\n    - D: The strategy is ineffective because it does not consider the initial egg distribution\n[Correct answer]: A"
