The 13th hole at Augusta National Golf Club requires a series of shots around the corner from the tee.\n2. Bubba Watson hit a remarkable shot at the 2014 Masters Tournament, slicing the ball left and over the trees to land in front of the green.\n3. The average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour has climbed over 30 yards since 1980.\n4. The earliest golf balls were made of wood, hair, feathers, and gutta percha.\n5. Dimpled balls fly farther due to the creation of a protective layer of turbulence around the ball.\n6. The Pro V1 golf ball has a solid, multi-layered core, which allows for both distance and accuracy.\n7. The average driving distance shot up six yards in the year 2000, after the introduction of solid multi-layer balls.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Golfers are hitting the ball farther due to a combination of factors, including increased strength, high-tech clubs, and better course conditions.\n2. The rise in driving distance is causing concerns about the game, as players can now fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult.\n3. The Pro V1 golf ball revolutionized the sport by providing a ball that can achieve both distance and accuracy.\n4. The debate about the flight of the ball has been ongoing for nearly a hundred years, with concerns about whether the ball goes too far.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Golfers can apply the concept of dimpling to improve their game, by using balls with optimized dimple patterns.\n2. Course designers can take into account the increased driving distance when designing new courses or modifying existing ones.\n3. Ball manufacturers can apply the principles of aerodynamics to design balls that achieve the optimal balance between distance and accuracy.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the rise in driving distance and the introduction of solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1.\n2. The contrast between the benefits of increased driving distance (e.g., more exciting gameplay) and the drawbacks (e.g., making courses obsolete).\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the increased driving distance and the need for course modifications or rule changes.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining the concepts of dimpling and multi-layer ball design to create a new ball that achieves even greater distance and accuracy.\n2. Integrating the principles of aerodynamics and materials science to develop new ball technologies.\n3. Considering the implications of the rise in driving distance on the game of golf as a whole, including the potential need for rule changes or course modifications.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Evaluating the impact of the Pro V1 golf ball on the game of golf, including its benefits and drawbacks.\n2. Assessing the effectiveness of potential solutions to the problem of increased driving distance, such as making golf balls bigger or heavier.\n3. Justifying the need for rule changes or course modifications to address the issue of increased driving distance.\n4. Critiquing the role of ball manufacturers in the debate about the flight of the ball, including their motivations and responsibilities."
