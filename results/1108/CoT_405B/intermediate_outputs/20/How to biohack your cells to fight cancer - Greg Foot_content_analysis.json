Each cell has its own task, making the human body a \"mega-meat-bot.\"\n3. The human body's mission is to safeguard, duplicate, and pass on its genetic code.\n4. Errors in copying the genetic code can lead to evolution.\n5. Cancer occurs when a copying error leads to a cell dividing uncontrollably.\n6. CAR T-cell therapy is a treatment that reprograms a patient's immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.\n7. T-cells and B-cells are two types of white blood cells that play a crucial role in the immune system.\n8. Antigens are protein fragments on the surface of cells that help the immune system identify them.\n9. DNA is made up of four chemical letters: A, C, T, and G.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The human body is a complex system made up of trillions of cells working together.\n2. Evolution occurs through the process of genetic variation and natural selection.\n3. Cancer is a result of the immune system's inability to recognize and destroy rogue cells.\n4. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer.\n5. The immune system has a hard time recognizing cancer cells because they have similar antigens to healthy cells.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Understanding how the immune system works can help us develop new treatments for diseases like cancer.\n2. CAR T-cell therapy can be used to treat blood cancers like acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n3. Synthetic biologists can design and print new genetic code to reprogram T-cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells.\n4. The use of CAR T-cell therapy can improve the survival rate of patients with certain types of cancer.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between genetic variation and evolution is crucial in understanding how cancer develops.\n2. The contrast between the immune system's ability to recognize external pathogens and its inability to recognize internal cancer cells is a key challenge in cancer treatment.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between genetic errors and cancer development is a critical aspect of understanding the disease.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining the concepts of genetic engineering and immunotherapy can lead to new and innovative treatments for cancer.\n2. The use of CAR T-cell therapy can be combined with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, to improve patient outcomes.\n3. Understanding the genetic code and how it can be reprogrammed can lead to new insights into the development of cancer and other diseases.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapy in treating certain types of cancer can be evaluated by looking at patient survival rates and remission rates.\n2. The cost and accessibility of CAR T-cell therapy can be evaluated in terms of its impact on patient outcomes and healthcare systems.\n3. The ethics of genetic engineering and its application in cancer treatment can be evaluated in terms of its potential risks and benefits."
