    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many plant species have evolved to be carnivorous?\n    - A: Over 100\n    - B: Over 600\n    - C: Over 1,000\n    - D: Over 2,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the powerful narcotic found in the nectar of some pitcher plants?\n    - A: Mucilage\n    - B: Coniine\n    - C: Digestive enzyme\n    - D: Adhesive substance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why have some plants evolved to obtain essential nutrients from insects and other prey?\n    - A: Because they grow in areas with highly alkaline soil\n    - B: Because they grow in areas with highly acidic soil that lacks essential nutrients\n    - C: Because they have a high demand for nutrients\n    - D: Because they have a low demand for nutrients\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is unique about the features of carnivorous plants, such as traps and digestive enzymes?\n    - A: They allow the plants to capture and digest other plants\n    - B: They allow the plants to capture and digest prey\n    - C: They allow the plants to absorb nutrients from the soil\n    - D: They allow the plants to produce nectar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can the study of carnivorous plants inform us about?\n    - A: The diversity of animal species\n    - B: The diversity of plant species and their adaptations to different environments\n    - C: The importance of soil nutrients\n    - D: The evolution of animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential application of the study of carnivorous plants?\n    - A: Developing new technologies for capturing and digesting organic matter\n    - B: Developing new technologies for absorbing nutrients from the soil\n    - C: Developing new technologies for producing nectar\n    - D: Developing new technologies for studying animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How did the environment influence the evolution of carnivorous plants?\n    - A: The environment had no impact on the evolution of carnivorous plants\n    - B: The environment led to the development of carnivory in plants due to the lack of essential nutrients in the soil\n    - C: The environment led to the development of carnivory in plants due to the abundance of essential nutrients in the soil\n    - D: The environment led to the development of carnivory in plants due to the presence of other carnivorous plants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between the capture of prey and the provision of essential nutrients to the plant?\n    - A: The capture of prey has no effect on the provision of essential nutrients to the plant\n    - B: The capture of prey provides essential nutrients to the plant, allowing it to thrive\n    - C: The capture of prey provides non-essential nutrients to the plant, having no impact on its survival\n    - D: The capture of prey provides essential nutrients to other plants in the environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What type of evolution is exemplified by the development of carnivory in plants?\n    - A: Divergent evolution\n    - B: Convergent evolution\n    - C: Parallel evolution\n    - D: Co-evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How can the unique features of carnivorous plants be applied in other fields?\n    - A: To develop new solutions for capturing and digesting inorganic matter\n    - B: To develop new solutions for capturing and digesting organic matter\n    - C: To develop new solutions for absorbing nutrients from the soil\n    - D: To develop new solutions for producing nectar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is it important to study carnivorous plants in understanding the evolution of unique adaptations?\n    - A: Because they are the only plants that have evolved carnivory\n    - B: Because they provide insights into the evolution of unique adaptations in response to environmental pressures\n    - C: Because they are the most efficient plants at capturing and digesting prey\n    - D: Because they are the most diverse group of plants\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential limitation of using carnivorous plant technology in real-world scenarios?\n    - A: It is too expensive to implement\n    - B: It is too complex to understand\n    - C: It may not be scalable or efficient in certain environments\n    - D: It is not necessary to use carnivorous plant technology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the wording and phrasing of the questions to improve clarity and concision. I also reviewed the distractors to ensure they are plausible but incorrect. No major changes were necessary, and the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript."
