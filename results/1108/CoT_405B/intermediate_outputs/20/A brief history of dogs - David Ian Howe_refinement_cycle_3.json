    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how long ago did modern humans emerge?\n    - A: Over 100,000 years ago\n    - B: Over 200,000 years ago\n    - C: Over 300,000 years ago\n    - D: Over 50,000 years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated bite pressure of gray wolves?\n    - A: Over 100 lbs.\n    - B: Over 200 lbs.\n    - C: Over 300 lbs.\n    - D: Over 400 lbs.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What primary factor contributed to the diversity of dog breeds?\n    - A: Natural selection and genetic drift\n    - B: Artificial selection and breeding practices\n    - C: Mutation and genetic variation\n    - D: Environmental factors and adaptation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How did wolves adapt to human presence during the domestication process?\n    - A: They became more aggressive and fearful\n    - B: They became less aggressive and more docile\n    - C: They remained unchanged and unaffected\n    - D: They became more competitive and dominant\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding the history of dog domestication inform us about?\n    - A: Strategies for training and interacting with other animals\n    - B: Strategies for breeding and conserving wildlife\n    - C: Strategies for understanding human evolution and relationships with other species\n    - D: Strategies for improving human-dog relationships and dog welfare\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Recognizing the impact of artificial selection on dog breeds can guide:\n    - A: Irresponsible breeding practices and prioritizing physical characteristics\n    - B: Responsible breeding practices and prioritizing dog welfare\n    - C: Training methods and behavioral modification\n    - D: Conservation efforts and wildlife management\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) The relationship between humans and dogs is an example of:\n    - A: Co-evolution and mutual adaptation\n    - B: Parallel evolution and separate development\n    - C: Convergent evolution and similar traits\n    - D: Divergent evolution and distinct characteristics\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What has led to changes in dog behavior, physiology, and anatomy over time?\n    - A: Only natural selection and genetic drift\n    - B: Only artificial selection and breeding practices\n    - C: Both natural and artificial selection, as well as genetic variation\n    - D: Neither natural nor artificial selection, but rather environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) The domestication of dogs can be seen as a model for understanding:\n    - A: The process of speciation and the emergence of new species\n    - B: The process of co-evolution and the impact of human activity on species development\n    - C: The process of adaptation and the role of environmental factors\n    - D: The process of genetic drift and the influence of chance events\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) The study of human-dog relationships can provide insights into:\n    - A: The evolution of physical characteristics and cognitive abilities\n    - B: The evolution of social behavior, emotional bonding, and communication in both humans and animals\n    - C: The evolution of language and cultural development\n    - D: The evolution of ecological relationships and conservation biology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What should be evaluated in light of the impact on dog welfare and health?\n    - A: The ethics of artificial selection and breeding practices\n    - B: The effectiveness of training methods and behavioral modification\n    - C: The importance of conservation efforts and wildlife management\n    - D: The value of preserving genetic diversity and ecosystem services\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) Assessing the consequences of human activity on species evolution and development can highlight:\n    - A: The importance of responsible stewardship and conservation\n    - B: The impact of climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity\n    - C: The value of preserving genetic diversity and ecosystem services\n    - D: The role of human activity in shaping ecological relationships\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, but minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No more refinement needed."
