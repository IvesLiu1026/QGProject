    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the value of 2 to the 10th power?\n    - A: 512\n    - B: 1,024\n    - C: 2,048\n    - D: 4,096\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the number of possible outcomes when flipping a fair coin?\n    - A: 1\n    - B: 2\n    - C: 3\n    - D: 4\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a common application of probability in mathematics?\n    - A: Calculating exact values\n    - B: Making predictions and determining odds\n    - C: Analyzing data\n    - D: Creating graphs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can be expected to happen to the average score on a true/false quiz where everyone randomly guesses?\n    - A: It will be around 25%\n    - B: It will be around 50%\n    - C: It will be around 75%\n    - D: It will be around 100%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A 10-question true/false quiz has 2 possible outcomes for each question. How many possible outcomes are there for the entire quiz?\n    - A: 10\n    - B: 100\n    - C: 1,024\n    - D: 2,048\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) An insurance company wants to determine the odds of a car accident occurring. What mathematical concept should they use?\n    - A: Algebra\n    - B: Geometry\n    - C: Probability\n    - D: Statistics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the probability of getting a perfect score on a true/false quiz change as the number of questions increases?\n    - A: It increases\n    - B: It decreases\n    - C: It stays the same\n    - D: It becomes unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between the number of possible outcomes and the probability of getting a correct answer on a multiple-choice test?\n    - A: As the number of possible outcomes increases, the probability of getting a correct answer increases\n    - B: As the number of possible outcomes increases, the probability of getting a correct answer decreases\n    - C: As the number of possible outcomes increases, the probability of getting a correct answer stays the same\n    - D: As the number of possible outcomes increases, the probability of getting a correct answer becomes unpredictable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) A student wants to improve their score on a multiple-choice test by using probability. What strategy could they use?\n    - A: Guess randomly on every question\n    - B: Eliminate obviously incorrect answers and guess from the remaining options\n    - C: Always choose the first answer option\n    - D: Always choose the last answer option\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What mathematical concept is essential for calculating the probability of getting all questions correct on a multiple-choice test?\n    - A: Algebra\n    - B: Geometry\n    - C: The fundamental counting principle\n    - D: Statistics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Why is guessing on a true/false quiz not a good idea?\n    - A: Because you have a 50% chance of getting each question correct\n    - B: Because the probability of getting a perfect score is low\n    - C: Because it's better to not answer at all\n    - D: Because it's cheating\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential limitation of using probability to determine insurance rates?\n    - A: It's too accurate\n    - B: It's too complex\n    - C: It doesn't take into account individual circumstances\n    - D: It's too expensive\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinement is needed, but minor adjustments may be necessary based on further feedback."
