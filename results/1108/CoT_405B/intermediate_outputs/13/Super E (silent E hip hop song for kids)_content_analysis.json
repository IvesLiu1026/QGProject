    "content_analysis": "Based on the provided transcript, here is the analysis categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n1. There are two ways to make a vowel say its name.\n2. \"Super E\" is a type of vowel combination that makes a vowel say its name.\n3. A \"Super E\" can jump over one letter to find a vowel and make it say its name.\n4. Examples of words that use \"Super E\" to make a vowel say its name include \"game\", \"kite\", and \"rope\".\n\n**Comprehension**:\n1. The concept of \"Super E\" and its role in making vowels say their names.\n2. The process of how \"Super E\" jumps over one letter to find a vowel and make it say its name.\n3. Understanding the difference in pronunciation between words with and without the \"Super E\" (e.g., \"gam\" vs. \"game\", \"kit\" vs. \"kite\", \"rock\" vs. \"rope\").\n\n**Application**:\n1. Identifying words that use the \"Super E\" combination to make a vowel say its name.\n2. Applying the concept of \"Super E\" to decode unfamiliar words.\n3. Using the \"Super E\" rule to improve reading and pronunciation skills.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. Recognizing the relationship between the \"Super E\" and the vowel it affects.\n2. Identifying the cause-and-effect connection between the presence of \"Super E\" and the change in pronunciation.\n3. Comparing and contrasting words with and without the \"Super E\" to understand the impact on pronunciation.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n1. Combining the concept of \"Super E\" with other phonics rules to improve reading and decoding skills.\n2. Generating a list of words that use the \"Super E\" combination to make a vowel say its name.\n3. Creating new words by applying the \"Super E\" rule to existing words.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n1. Judging whether a word uses the \"Super E\" combination correctly.\n2. Critiquing the pronunciation of words with and without the \"Super E\".\n3. Justifying the importance of understanding the \"Super E\" rule in reading and decoding."
