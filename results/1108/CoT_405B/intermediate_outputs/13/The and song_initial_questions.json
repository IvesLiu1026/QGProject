    "initial_questions": "Unfortunately, I cannot create multiple-choice questions based on the provided content analysis as there is no transcript available for analysis. However, I can guide you on how to create questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level once you provide the transcript.\n\nHere's a general outline of how to create questions for each level:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n- Identify specific facts, dates, and details in the transcript.\n- Create questions that require recalling these facts, such as \"What is the definition of...\", \"Who is the main character in...\", or \"What is the primary theme of...\".\n\n**Comprehension**:\n- Summarize key concepts and main ideas in the transcript.\n- Create questions that require understanding these concepts, such as \"What is the main idea of...\", \"How does... relate to...\", or \"What is the author trying to say about...\".\n\n**Application**:\n- Identify real-world scenarios or applications related to the transcript.\n- Create questions that require applying the information to these scenarios, such as \"How would you use... in a real-world situation?\", \"What would happen if...\", or \"How does... relate to your own life?\".\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Identify relationships, patterns, and connections in the transcript.\n- Create questions that require breaking down or examining these relationships, such as \"What is the relationship between... and...\", \"How does... compare to...\", or \"What are the strengths and weaknesses of...\".\n\n**Synthesis**:\n- Identify areas where ideas can be combined or new insights can be created.\n- Create questions that require combining ideas, such as \"How would you combine... and... to create something new?\", \"What would happen if you merged... and...\", or \"How does... relate to other concepts in the field?\".\n\n**Evaluation**:\n- Identify areas for judgment, critique, or justification in the transcript.\n- Create questions that require evaluating or justifying information, such as \"Do you agree or disagree with...\", \"What are the strengths and weaknesses of...\", or \"How would you justify...\".\n\nPlease provide the transcript, and I'll be happy to help you create multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level."
