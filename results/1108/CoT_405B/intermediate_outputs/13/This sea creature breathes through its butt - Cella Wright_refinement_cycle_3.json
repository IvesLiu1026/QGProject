    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure alignment with key concepts, clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which phylum do sea cucumbers belong to?\n    - A: Arthropoda\n    - B: Mollusca\n    - C: Echinodermata\n    - D: Chordata\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What unique feature do some sea cucumbers have around their anus for defense?\n    - A: Three teeth\n    - B: Five tentacles\n    - C: Five teeth\n    - D: Ten spines\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary role of sea cucumbers in maintaining ecosystem health?\n    - A: To provide food for predators\n    - B: To clean and oxygenate the seafloor\n    - C: To form coral reefs\n    - D: To buffer ocean acidification\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary function of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) in sea cucumbers?\n    - A: To aid in digestion\n    - B: To defend themselves, aid in locomotion, and enable asexual reproduction\n    - C: To breathe through their anuses\n    - D: To regenerate lost organs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How do sea cucumbers contribute to the health of marine ecosystems?\n    - A: By controlling predator populations\n    - B: By cleaning and oxygenating the seafloor\n    - C: By forming coral reefs\n    - D: By reducing ocean acidification\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is an example of a complex defense mechanism in sea cucumbers?\n    - A: Their ability to breathe through their anuses\n    - B: Their ability to eviscerate and regenerate lost organs\n    - C: Their use of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) for defense\n    - D: Their radially symmetrical body shape\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What potential benefit could come from studying the unique properties of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT)?\n    - A: Improved understanding of ocean acidification\n    - B: Development of new materials or technologies inspired by MCT's versatility\n    - C: Enhanced conservation efforts for sea cucumbers\n    - D: Increased knowledge of coral reef formation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between sea cucumbers and their environment?\n    - A: Mutually beneficial\n    - B: Commensal\n    - C: Parasitic\n    - D: Neutral\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How do sea cucumbers interact with their environment to maintain ecosystem health?\n    - A: By preying on other animals\n    - B: By competing with other species for resources\n    - C: By cleaning and oxygenating the seafloor\n    - D: By forming symbiotic relationships with other species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is necessary to assess the effectiveness of sea cucumber conservation efforts?\n    - A: Evaluating the impact of human activities on their populations and ecosystems\n    - B: Studying the unique properties of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT)\n    - C: Informing strategies for protecting coral reefs\n    - D: Reducing ocean acidification\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11-15 as they were redundant or too similar to other questions. The refined set of questions covers the key concepts and ensures clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers."
