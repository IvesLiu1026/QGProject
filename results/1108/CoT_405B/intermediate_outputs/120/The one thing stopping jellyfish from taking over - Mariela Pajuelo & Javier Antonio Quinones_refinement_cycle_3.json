Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate weight of a Nomura's jellyfish in the Sea of Japan?\n    - A: 100 kilograms\n    - B: 150 kilograms\n    - C: 180 kilograms\n    - D: 200 kilograms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How much jellyfish do leatherbacks consume in their 50-year lifespans?\n    - A: 500 metric tons\n    - B: 750 metric tons\n    - C: 1,000 metric tons\n    - D: 1,200 metric tons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary role of sea turtles, particularly leatherbacks, in controlling marine populations?\n    - A: To consume fish eggs and larvae\n    - B: To outcompete adult fish for resources\n    - C: To pollute the oceans\n    - D: To regulate jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What human activities contribute to the rapid increase in jellyfish populations?\n    - A: Climate change\n    - B: Overfishing\n    - C: Fertilizer runoff, climate change, and pollution\n    - D: Natural cycles\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A small-scale fishery is looking to minimize bycatch. What strategy could they use?\n    - A: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - B: Using green LED lights on gillnets\n    - C: Reducing the number of fishing vessels\n    - D: Increasing the size of the fishing nets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A government is looking to address the root causes of jellyfish blooms. What policy-based solution could they implement?\n    - A: Reducing fertilizer runoff and pollution\n    - B: Increasing the number of fishing vessels\n    - C: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - D: Promoting unsustainable fishing practices\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between jellyfish populations and sea turtle populations?\n    - A: Jellyfish populations control sea turtle populations\n    - B: There is no relationship between the two\n    - C: Jellyfish and sea turtles are symbiotic\n    - D: Sea turtle populations regulate jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) How do human activities impact jellyfish blooms?\n    - A: Human activities have no impact on jellyfish blooms\n    - B: Human activities reduce jellyfish blooms\n    - C: The impact of human activities is unknown\n    - D: Human activities exacerbate jellyfish blooms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What could be an effective strategy for protecting sea turtles and controlling jellyfish populations?\n    - A: Combining knowledge of sea turtle biology and ecology with conservation efforts\n    - B: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - C: Reducing the number of fishing vessels\n    - D: Increasing the size of the fishing nets\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be an effective approach to mitigating the effects of jellyfish blooms?\n    - A: Integrating research on jellyfish reproduction and defense mechanisms with policy-based solutions\n    - B: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - C: Reducing the number of fishing vessels\n    - D: Increasing the size of the fishing nets\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why is it essential to continue research and conservation efforts to protect sea turtles and their habitats?\n    - A: The economic benefits of sea turtle conservation\n    - B: The aesthetic value of sea turtles\n    - C: The lack of research on sea turtles\n    - D: The crucial role of sea turtles in maintaining marine ecosystem balance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is the primary criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation efforts, such as using green LED lights on gillnets?\n    - A: The reduction in bycatch\n    - B: The increase in fishing revenue\n    - C: The decrease in marine biodiversity\n    - D: The increase in jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
