    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the primary use of the African clawed frog from the 1930s to the 1960s?\n    - A: Studying developmental biology\n    - B: Pregnancy testing\n    - C: Researching the pituitary gland\n    - D: Testing the effects of hCG on animals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How long does the African clawed frog typically live?\n    - A: 5-10 years\n    - B: 10-15 years\n    - C: 15-30 years\n    - D: 30-50 years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why was the African clawed frog useful for pregnancy testing?\n    - A: Its ability to change color in response to hCG\n    - B: Its large ovaries and ability to generate eggs quickly in response to hCG\n    - C: Its lack of tongue and aquatic adaptation\n    - D: Its ability to outcompete native amphibians\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What led to the African clawed frog's classification as an invasive species?\n    - A: Its use in scientific research\n    - B: Its ability to adapt to different environments\n    - C: Its ability to outcompete native amphibians and carry a deadly fungus\n    - D: Its large ovaries and ability to generate eggs quickly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What does the use of the African clawed frog in pregnancy testing demonstrate about scientific research?\n    - A: The importance of technological advancements in improving medical testing\n    - B: The need for responsible management of non-native species in ecosystems\n    - C: The importance of interdisciplinary research in solving real-world problems\n    - D: The limitations and potential consequences of using animals in scientific research\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is a potential consequence of introducing the African clawed frog to a new ecosystem?\n    - A: The decline of native amphibian populations\n    - B: The introduction of new predators to the ecosystem\n    - C: The disruption of the food chain\n    - D: The creation of new habitats for native species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the pituitary gland and the African clawed frog's color-changing mechanism?\n    - A: The pituitary gland produces the hormone that causes the frog's skin to change color\n    - B: The pituitary gland regulates the frog's body temperature, which affects its skin color\n    - C: The pituitary gland is responsible for the frog's ability to adapt to different environments\n    - D: The pituitary gland has a role in the frog's color-changing mechanism, but the exact relationship is not specified\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is a consequence of the African clawed frog's presence in ecosystems?\n    - A: The decline of native amphibian populations\n    - B: The introduction of new predators to the ecosystem\n    - C: The disruption of the food chain\n    - D: The creation of new habitats for native species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What combination of factors led to the use of the African clawed frog in pregnancy testing?\n    - A: The frog's unique features, its response to hCG, and its large ovaries\n    - B: The frog's large ovaries and ability to generate eggs quickly\n    - C: The frog's lack of tongue and aquatic adaptation\n    - D: The frog's ability to outcompete native amphibians\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the result of integrating the African clawed frog's invasive species classification and its usefulness in scientific research?\n    - A: The need for responsible management of non-native species in ecosystems\n    - B: The importance of technological advancements in improving medical testing\n    - C: The limitations and potential consequences of using animals in scientific research\n    - D: The creation of new habitats for native species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is an ethical concern raised by the use of the African clawed frog in pregnancy testing?\n    - A: The treatment and potential consequences of using animals in scientific research\n    - B: The impact of technology on traditional methods\n    - C: The need for regulations on the use of non-native species in ecosystems\n    - D: The balance between the frog's usefulness in scientific research and its invasive species classification\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What justifies the need for regulations on the use of non-native species in ecosystems?\n    - A: The African clawed frog's invasive species classification and its impact on native ecosystems\n    - B: The importance of technological advancements in improving medical testing\n    - C: The limitations of using animals in scientific research\n    - D: The creation of new habitats for native species\n[Correct answer]: A"
