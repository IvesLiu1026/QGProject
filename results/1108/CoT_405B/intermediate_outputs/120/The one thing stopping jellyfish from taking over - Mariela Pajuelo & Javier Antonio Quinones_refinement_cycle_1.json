    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate weight of a Nomura's jellyfish in the Sea of Japan?\n    - A: 50 kilograms\n    - B: 100 kilograms\n    - C: 150 kilograms\n    - D: 200 kilograms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How much jellyfish do leatherbacks consume in their 50-year lifespans?\n    - A: 500 metric tons\n    - B: 750 metric tons\n    - C: 1,000 metric tons\n    - D: 1,500 metric tons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary role of sea turtles, particularly leatherbacks, in marine ecosystems?\n    - A: To consume fish eggs and larvae\n    - B: To outcompete adult fish for resources\n    - C: To pollute the oceans\n    - D: To control jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is the primary cause of the rapid increase in jellyfish populations?\n    - A: Climate change\n    - B: Overfishing\n    - C: Human activities such as fertilizer runoff, climate change, and pollution\n    - D: Natural cycles\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A small-scale fishery is looking to minimize bycatch. What strategy could they use?\n    - A: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - B: Using green LED lights on gillnets\n    - C: Reducing the number of fishing vessels\n    - D: Increasing the size of the fishing nets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A government is looking to address the root causes of jellyfish blooms. What policy-based solution could they implement?\n    - A: Reducing fertilizer runoff and pollution\n    - B: Increasing the number of fishing vessels\n    - C: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - D: Promoting unsustainable fishing practices\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between jellyfish populations and sea turtle populations?\n    - A: Jellyfish populations control sea turtle populations\n    - B: There is no relationship between the two\n    - C: Jellyfish and sea turtles are symbiotic\n    - D: Sea turtle populations control jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the impact of human activities on jellyfish blooms?\n    - A: Human activities have no impact on jellyfish blooms\n    - B: Human activities reduce jellyfish blooms\n    - C: The impact of human activities is unknown\n    - D: Human activities exacerbate jellyfish blooms\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What could be an effective strategy for protecting sea turtles and controlling jellyfish populations?\n    - A: Combining knowledge of sea turtle biology and ecology with conservation efforts\n    - B: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - C: Reducing the number of fishing vessels\n    - D: Increasing the size of the fishing nets\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be an effective approach to mitigating the effects of jellyfish blooms?\n    - A: Integrating research on jellyfish reproduction and defense mechanisms with policy-based solutions\n    - B: Implementing a marine protected area\n    - C: Reducing the number of fishing vessels\n    - D: Increasing the size of the fishing nets\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the primary justification for continued research and conservation efforts to protect sea turtles and their habitats?\n    - A: The economic benefits of sea turtle conservation\n    - B: The aesthetic value of sea turtles\n    - C: The lack of research on sea turtles\n    - D: The crucial role of sea turtles in maintaining marine ecosystem balance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is the primary criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation efforts, such as using green LED lights on gillnets?\n    - A: The reduction in bycatch\n    - B: The increase in fishing revenue\n    - C: The decrease in marine biodiversity\n    - D: The increase in jellyfish populations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor adjustments to ensure clarity and conciseness, and to make the distractors more plausible but incorrect. No major changes were necessary, and the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript."
