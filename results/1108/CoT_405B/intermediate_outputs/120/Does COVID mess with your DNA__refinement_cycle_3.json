    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the typical duration of long COVID symptoms in individuals?\n    - A: 1-2 weeks\n    - B: 4 weeks to 3 months\n    - C: 6 months to 1 year\n    - D: More than 1 year\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of epigenetic modification can quiet down gene expression by adding a tag to the DNA?\n    - A: Histone acetylation\n    - B: DNA methylation\n    - C: Gene amplification\n    - D: Chromatin remodeling\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of epigenetics in relation to gene expression?\n    - A: To change the DNA sequence\n    - B: To modulate genetic information without changing the DNA sequence\n    - C: To increase gene expression\n    - D: To decrease gene expression\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the potential link between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and epigenetic signals in our cells?\n    - A: The virus has no effect on epigenetic signals\n    - B: The virus may affect epigenetic signals, leading to changes in gene expression\n    - C: The virus only affects DNA methylation\n    - D: The virus only affects histone modification\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation, be used in the diagnosis of long COVID?\n    - A: To develop new treatments\n    - B: To identify genetic mutations\n    - C: To detect changes in gene expression\n    - D: To predict disease severity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential application of understanding the link between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome?\n    - A: Developing new diagnostic tools\n    - B: Developing new treatments for long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome\n    - C: Identifying genetic mutations\n    - D: Predicting disease severity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression?\n    - A: DNA methylation increases gene expression\n    - B: DNA methylation decreases gene expression\n    - C: DNA methylation has no effect on gene expression\n    - D: DNA methylation only affects histone modification\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential limitation of the current studies on DNA methylation in long COVID patients?\n    - A: Large sample sizes\n    - B: Consistent findings\n    - C: Small sample sizes and conflicting findings\n    - D: Lack of funding\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) Why is it essential to conduct further research on epigenetic changes in long COVID patients?\n    - A: To develop new diagnostic tools and treatments\n    - B: To identify genetic mutations\n    - C: To predict disease severity\n    - D: To understand the underlying mechanisms of long COVID\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is a potential implication of understanding epigenetic changes in long COVID patients?\n    - A: Developing new diagnostic tools and treatments\n    - B: Identifying genetic mutations\n    - C: Predicting disease severity\n    - D: Developing new vaccines\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made some minor adjustments to the questions and distractors to improve clarity and conciseness. However, the overall content and correct answers remain the same. No more refinement needed."
