    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to a 2021 survey, what percentage of 1,000 Americans had eaten plant-based meat alternatives in the past year?\n    - A: Nearly one-third\n    - B: Nearly two-thirds\n    - C: Nearly three-quarters\n    - D: Nearly all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated percentage of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions generated by animal agriculture?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 14.5%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary goal of creating plant-based meat alternatives?\n    - A: To reduce the nutritional content of meat\n    - B: To increase the environmental impact of meat production\n    - C: To mimic the taste and texture of farmed meat\n    - D: To eliminate the need for animal agriculture\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is a potential environmental benefit of switching to plant-based meat alternatives?\n    - A: Increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Decreased nutritional content\n    - C: Reduced land and water consumption\n    - D: Reduced greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) If you want to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions, what could you do in your daily meals?\n    - A: Increase your consumption of red meat\n    - B: Switch to plant-based meat alternatives\n    - C: Eat more processed meats\n    - D: Reduce your consumption of fruits and vegetables\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) When making dietary choices, what should you consider to make informed decisions?\n    - A: Only the taste and texture of the food\n    - B: Only the nutritional content of the food\n    - C: The nutritional content, environmental impact, and animal welfare implications of the food\n    - D: Only the environmental impact of the food\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What should you consider when comparing the nutritional content of farmed meat, plant-based meat alternatives, and lab-grown meat?\n    - A: Only the protein content\n    - B: Only the fat content\n    - C: The protein, carbohydrate, and fat content, as well as other nutrients\n    - D: Only the calorie content\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a potential relationship between meat consumption and greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Increased meat consumption leads to decreased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Decreased meat consumption leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: Increased meat consumption leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - D: There is no relationship between meat consumption and greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What should you consider when making informed decisions about meat consumption?\n    - A: Only the nutritional content of the meat\n    - B: Only the environmental impact of the meat\n    - C: The nutritional content, environmental impact, and animal welfare implications of the meat\n    - D: Only the animal welfare implications of the meat\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) According to a 2022 study, what is the estimated reduction in personal dietary carbon emissions when forgoing red meat at one meal a day?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: 30%\n    - D: 48%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a characteristic of lab-grown meat that is still being developed?\n    - A: High in sodium\n    - B: High in saturated fat\n    - C: Potential to offer the same nutritional qualities as farmed meat\n    - D: Currently widely available in the market\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential health concern associated with consuming red and processed meats?\n    - A: Type 1 diabetes\n    - B: Heart disease and type 2 diabetes\n    - C: High blood pressure\n    - D: Obesity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 10 (from the initial set) and replaced it with a new question 10, as the initial question 10 was not directly related to the transcript. I also rephrased question 11 to make it more specific and clear. Additionally, I rephrased question 12 to make it more concise and accurate. The rest of the questions were refined to ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy."
