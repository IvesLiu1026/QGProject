Xenon is an inert gas located at the bottom of the periodic table.\n3. Xenon is dense due to its large and heavy gas molecules.\n4. Neil Bartlett discovered that xenon could form reactions and compounds in the early 1960s.\n5. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) is a gas and a metal compound.\n6. Xenon is expensive, with the balloon in the experiment containing about Â£40 worth of xenon.\n7. Xenon is obtained from the air, specifically from the separation of nitrogen and oxygen during the liquefaction of air.\n8. Xenon lamps are used in high-powered spotlights, such as those used on military tanks.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The experiment conducted by Neil Bartlett involved mixing xenon gas with platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) to form a compound.\n2.
