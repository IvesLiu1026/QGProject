    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1) Where are coral reefs primarily found?\n    - A: In the Arctic Circle\n    - B: In a belt around the equator\n    - C: In the deep sea\n    - D: In freshwater lakes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the seafloor do coral reefs cover?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 25%\n    - C: Less than 1%\n    - D: 50%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1) Why are coral reefs often referred to as the \"tropical rainforests of the sea\"?\n    - A: Because they are located near the equator\n    - B: Because they are home to a diverse array of marine life\n    - C: Because they are formed by coral polyps\n    - D: Because they are shallow\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the relationship between corals and algae?\n    - A: Predation\n    - B: Competition\n    - C: Symbiosis\n    - D: Parasitism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application:**\n\n1) A coastal community is experiencing frequent flooding due to storms. What could be a potential solution to mitigate this issue?\n    - A: Building a seawall\n    - B: Protecting and restoring nearby coral reefs\n    - C: Dredging the ocean floor\n    - D: Implementing a fishing ban\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A conservation organization wants to improve the resilience of a coral reef. What approach could they take?\n    - A: Introducing invasive species\n    - B: Implementing selective breeding of corals\n    - C: Reducing fishing regulations\n    - D: Increasing pollution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the impact of climate change on coral reefs?\n    - A: Only increased water temperature\n    - B: Only increased frequency of bleaching events\n    - C: A multifaceted impact, including increased frequency of bleaching events and changes in water temperature\n    - D: No impact\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the significance of comparing coral reefs to tropical rainforests?\n    - A: To highlight the differences between the two ecosystems\n    - B: To emphasize the importance of preserving coral reefs\n    - C: To demonstrate the uniqueness of coral reefs\n    - D: To show the similarity in their geographical locations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) What could be the potential consequence of combining climate change, overfishing, and pollution on coral reefs?\n    - A: A slight decline in coral health\n    - B: A devastating impact on coral reefs\n    - C: No impact on coral reefs\n    - D: An increase in coral growth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How could selective breeding of corals be combined with conservation efforts?\n    - A: By introducing invasive species\n    - B: By creating more resilient reefs through selective breeding and conservation\n    - C: By reducing fishing regulations\n    - D: By increasing pollution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) Evaluate the statement: \"Coral reefs are going to go extinct by 2050.\"\n    - A: Accurate, based on current scientific data\n    - B: An exaggeration, as scientists believe reefs may decline but not become extinct\n    - C: Too conservative, as reefs may become extinct sooner\n    - D: Impossible to determine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the most effective way to evaluate the success of conservation efforts, such as marine protected areas and selective breeding of corals?\n    - A: Based on their economic cost\n    - B: Based on their impact on coral reef health\n    - C: Based on their popularity among tourists\n    - D: Based on their geographical location\n[Correct answer]: B"
