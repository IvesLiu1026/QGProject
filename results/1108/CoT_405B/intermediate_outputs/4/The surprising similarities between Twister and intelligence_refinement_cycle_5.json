Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to the networked neuroscience approach, what is the primary factor that determines the brain's intelligence?\n    - A: The number of brain cells\n    - B: The size of the brain\n    - C: The connections and patterns of communication between brain regions\n    - D: The brain's ability to focus attention\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What do researchers use to create maps of the major connections among brain regions in the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Electroencephalography (EEG)\n    - B: Brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\n    - C: Microscopes\n    - D: Behavioral observations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is cognitive flexibility, and how is it related to intelligence?\n    - A: The ability to store memories, which is directly related to intelligence\n    - B: The brain's ability to solve problems, which is the primary component of intelligence\n    - C: The capacity to change from one task to another, which is associated with higher intelligence\n    - D: The brain's ability to focus attention, which is unrelated to intelligence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What factors can influence cognitive flexibility and brain function, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Meditation, yoga, and mindfulness\n    - B: Reading, writing, and arithmetic\n    - C: Exercise, positive mood, sleep, and nutrition\n    - D: Playing video games and watching TV\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding the brain's network patterns help individuals, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Improve their memory\n    - B: Develop strategies to improve their cognitive flexibility and intelligence\n    - C: Enhance their problem-solving ability\n    - D: Boost their attention span\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the relationship between cognitive flexibility and intelligence, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and multifaceted\n    - C: Linear and causal\n    - D: Independent and unrelated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What can provide new insights into the nature of intelligence and brain function, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Combining cognitive flexibility and memory\n    - B: Integrating problem-solving ability and attention\n    - C: Analyzing the dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks\n    - D: Integrating cognitive flexibility and exercise\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What can lead to new strategies for improving brain function and intelligence, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Combining problem-solving ability and memory\n    - B: Integrating cognitive flexibility and sleep\n    - C: Integrating the ideas of cognitive flexibility, exercise, positive mood, sleep, and nutrition\n    - D: Combining cognitive flexibility and nutrition\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What approach can be evaluated for its strengths and limitations in understanding brain function and intelligence?\n    - A: The cognitive flexibility approach\n    - B: The networked neuroscience approach\n    - C: The theory of multiple intelligences\n    - D: The concept of emotional intelligence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) According to the networked neuroscience approach, what is the significance of the brain's network patterns in understanding intelligence?\n    - A: They determine the brain's ability to store memories\n    - B: They influence the brain's problem-solving ability\n    - C: They reveal the dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks, which is associated with higher intelligence\n    - D: They are unrelated to intelligence\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
