What would be a useful tool for them to use?\n    - A: Traditional genealogy research\n    - B: Genetic testing\n    - C: Historical records\n    - D: Online forums\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A researcher wants to study the origins of humans and other species. What type of DNA would be most useful for them to study?\n    - A: Mitochondrial DNA\n    - B: Y-chromosome DNA\n    - C: Autosomal DNA\n    - D: X-chromosome DNA\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the number of ancestors and the number of generations?\n    - A: The number of ancestors decreases as the number of generations increases\n    - B: The number of ancestors increases exponentially with each generation\n    - C: The number of ancestors remains constant across generations\n    - D: The number of ancestors decreases exponentially with each generation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the genetic variation within humans compare to that of other species, such as chimps?\n    - A: Humans have more genetic variation than chimps\n    - B: Humans have less genetic variation than chimps\n    - C: Humans and chimps have similar levels of genetic variation\n    - D: The comparison is not possible due to limited data\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) How can the concepts of genetic changes and mitochondrial DNA be combined to understand human history?\n    - A: By using genetic changes to estimate time and relatedness, and mitochondrial DNA to study the origins of humans\n    - B: By using genetic changes to study the origins of humans, and mitochondrial DNA to estimate time and relatedness\n    - C: By using genetic changes to understand human migration patterns, and mitochondrial DNA to study the origins of specific surnames\n    - D: By using genetic changes to study the impact of inbreeding, and mitochondrial DNA to understand human evolution\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be learned by integrating the idea of inbreeding with the concept of genetic changes?\n    - A: The importance of genetic testing in genealogy\n    - B: The complexity of human ancestry and the connections between individuals\n    - C: The impact of genetic changes on human evolution\n    - D: The origins of specific surnames\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is a limitation of genetic testing in determining ancestry?\n    - A: It can only provide information about an individual's maternal lineage\n    - B: It can only provide information about an individual's paternal lineage\n    - C: It can be biased by the presence of inbreeding\n    - D: It can be limited by the availability of reference populations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the significance of mitochondrial Eve in human origins?\n    - A: She represents the most recent common ancestor of all humans\n    - B: She represents the earliest human ancestor to migrate out of Africa\n    - C: She represents the first human to undergo genetic changes\n    - D: She represents the most ancient human mitochondrial DNA\n[Correct answer]: A"
