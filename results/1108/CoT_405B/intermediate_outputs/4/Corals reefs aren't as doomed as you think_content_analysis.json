    "content_analysis": "Here's the analysis of the transcript, categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge:**\n\n1. Coral reefs are found in a belt around the equator.\n2. The Great Barrier Reef is the most famous coral reef.\n3. Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the seafloor but are home to 25% of all marine life.\n4. Coral reefs can reduce wave energy by up to 97%, protecting 200 million people from coastal flooding and hurricanes.\n5. 1 billion people depend on coral reefs for food and fishing.\n6. Coral reefs benefit the global economy by $30 billion each year.\n7. Corals are animals that have a symbiotic relationship with algae.\n8. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel their algae due to stress.\n9. The frequency of coral bleaching events has increased in recent years.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. Coral reefs are often referred to as the \"tropical rainforests of the sea\" due to their high biodiversity.\n2. The relationship between corals and algae is an example of symbiosis, where both organisms benefit from each other.\n3. Coral bleaching is a major threat to coral reefs, but it's not a guarantee of coral death.\n4. Corals can recover from bleaching events if given enough time.\n5. The resilience of coral reefs can be improved through changes in fishing practices and selective breeding of corals.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. The concept of coral bleaching can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as the impact of climate change on coral reefs.\n2. The importance of coral reefs can be applied to conservation efforts, such as protecting reefs from overfishing and pollution.\n3. The idea of selective breeding of corals can be applied to restoration efforts, such as repopulating damaged reefs with resilient corals.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between corals and algae is complex and interdependent.\n2. The impact of climate change on coral reefs is multifaceted, including increased frequency of bleaching events and changes in water temperature.\n3. The concept of resilience can be applied to coral reefs, where small changes can have a significant impact on the overall health of the ecosystem.\n4. The comparison between coral reefs and tropical rainforests highlights the importance of preserving these ecosystems.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. The combination of climate change, overfishing, and pollution can have a devastating impact on coral reefs.\n2. The idea of selective breeding of corals can be combined with conservation efforts to create more resilient reefs.\n3. The concept of coral reefs as a \"shadow of their former selves\" highlights the potential consequences of inaction.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. The statement \"coral reefs are going to go extinct by 2050\" can be evaluated as an exaggeration, as scientists believe that while reefs may decline, they will not become extinct.\n2. The effectiveness of conservation efforts, such as marine protected areas and selective breeding of corals, can be evaluated based on their impact on coral reef health.\n3. The importance of addressing climate change as a major threat to coral reefs can be evaluated based on its potential impact on the ecosystem."
