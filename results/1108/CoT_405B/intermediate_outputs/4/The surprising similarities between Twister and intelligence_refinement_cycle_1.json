    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary factor that determines the brain's intelligence, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: The size of the brain\n    - B: The number of brain cells\n    - C: The connections and patterns of communication between brain regions\n    - D: The weight of the brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What do researchers use to create maps of the major connections among brain regions in the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Microscopes\n    - B: Brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\n    - C: Electroencephalography (EEG) only\n    - D: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the networked neuroscience approach, what determines the brain's intelligence?\n    - A: The size and number of brain cells\n    - B: The patterns of communication and dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks\n    - C: The brain's ability to store memories\n    - D: The brain's ability to solve problems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is an important aspect of intelligence, but not the only component, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Memory\n    - B: Problem-solving ability\n    - C: Cognitive flexibility\n    - D: Attention\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding the brain's network patterns help individuals, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Improve their memory\n    - B: Develop strategies to improve their cognitive flexibility and intelligence\n    - C: Enhance their problem-solving ability\n    - D: Boost their attention span\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What factors can influence cognitive flexibility and brain function, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Exercise, positive mood, sleep, and nutrition\n    - B: Reading, writing, and arithmetic\n    - C: Meditation, yoga, and mindfulness\n    - D: Playing video games and watching TV\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between cognitive flexibility and intelligence, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and multifaceted\n    - C: Linear and causal\n    - D: Independent and unrelated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can provide new insights into the nature of intelligence and brain function, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Combining cognitive flexibility and memory\n    - B: Integrating cognitive flexibility and exercise\n    - C: Combining the concepts of cognitive flexibility and networked neuroscience\n    - D: Integrating problem-solving ability and attention\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can lead to new strategies for improving brain function and intelligence, according to the networked neuroscience approach?\n    - A: Combining cognitive flexibility and nutrition\n    - B: Integrating cognitive flexibility and sleep\n    - C: Integrating the ideas of cognitive flexibility and exercise, positive mood, sleep, and nutrition\n    - D: Combining problem-solving ability and memory\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What approach can be evaluated for its strengths and limitations in understanding brain function and intelligence?\n    - A: The cognitive flexibility approach\n    - B: The networked neuroscience approach\n    - C: The theory of multiple intelligences\n    - D: The concept of emotional intelligence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were similar to question 10. The refined questions align with the key concepts in the transcript and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
