What type of structure would be most effective in keeping them warm?\n    - A: A lean-to made of branches\n    - B: A snow trench\n    - C: An igloo made of snow blocks\n    - D: A tent made of thin fabric\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) A builder wants to design a house that is energy-efficient and warm in cold climates. What material could they use as insulation?\n    - A: Metal\n    - B: Glass\n    - C: Snow or materials that mimic its insulating properties\n    - D: Plastic\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between the type of snow used and the effectiveness of an igloo as a shelter?\n    - A: The type of snow has no effect on the igloo's effectiveness\n    - B: The type of snow affects the igloo's structural integrity, but not its insulation\n    - C: The type of snow affects the igloo's insulation, but not its structural integrity\n    - D: The type of snow affects both the igloo's insulation and structural integrity\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the shape of an igloo and its stability?\n    - A: The shape of the igloo has no effect on its stability\n    - B: The shape of the igloo causes it to collapse under its own weight\n    - C: The shape of the igloo, specifically the catenary arch, distributes weight evenly and increases stability\n    - D: The shape of the igloo causes it to be more susceptible to wind damage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) How could the principles of igloo construction be combined with modern materials and technologies to create new, sustainable shelters?\n    - A: By using metal and glass to build igloos\n    - B: By using snow and ice to build modern houses\n    - C: By incorporating insulating materials and catenary arches into modern building designs\n    - D: By using igloos as a model for designing underwater habitats\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What new insulating materials could be developed to mimic the properties of snow?\n    - A: Materials with high thermal conductivity\n    - B: Materials with low thermal conductivity and high air-trapping ability\n    - C: Materials that are dense and heavy\n    - D: Materials that are transparent and reflective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) What is a potential limitation of using snow as a building material?\n    - A: It is too dense and heavy\n    - B: It is too expensive to harvest and transport\n    - C: It is prone to melting and collapse in warm temperatures\n    - D: It is too difficult to shape and mold\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential benefit of using traditional Inuit knowledge in modern construction or design?\n    - A: It would be too expensive and impractical\n    - B: It would not be compatible with modern materials and technologies\n    - C: It would provide valuable insights into sustainable and energy-efficient design\n    - D: It would only be useful for building igloos\n[Correct answer]: C"
