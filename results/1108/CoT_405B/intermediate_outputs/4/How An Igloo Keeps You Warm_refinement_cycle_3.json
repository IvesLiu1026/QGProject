    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) For how many years have the Inuit people successfully lived in the harsh Arctic environment?\n    - A: 1,000 years\n    - B: 5,000 years\n    - C: 10,000 years\n    - D: 20,000 years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of trapped air can powdery, fresh snow contain, making it an excellent insulator?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 75%\n    - C: 95%\n    - D: 99%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the concept of \"cold\" in physical terms?\n    - A: A physical entity that can be measured\n    - B: The absence of heat\n    - C: A type of energy transfer\n    - D: A type of insulation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does insulation, such as snow or sea otter fur, work to keep objects or living things warm?\n    - A: By transferring heat through convection\n    - B: By trapping air molecules to reduce heat transfer\n    - C: By radiating heat away from an object\n    - D: By conducting heat through a material\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A person is stranded in a cold environment and needs to build a shelter. What type of structure would be most effective in keeping them warm?\n    - A: A lean-to made of branches\n    - B: A snow trench\n    - C: An igloo made of snow blocks\n    - D: A tent made of thin fabric\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What type of material could a builder use as insulation to mimic the properties of snow?\n    - A: Materials with high thermal conductivity\n    - B: Materials with low thermal conductivity and high air-trapping ability\n    - C: Materials that are dense and heavy\n    - D: Materials that are transparent and reflective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the type of snow used affect the effectiveness of an igloo as a shelter?\n    - A: The type of snow has no effect on the igloo's effectiveness\n    - B: The type of snow affects the igloo's structural integrity, but not its insulation\n    - C: The type of snow affects the igloo's insulation, but not its structural integrity\n    - D: The type of snow affects both the igloo's insulation and structural integrity\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the relationship between the shape of an igloo and its stability?\n    - A: The shape of the igloo has no effect on its stability\n    - B: The shape of the igloo causes it to collapse under its own weight\n    - C: The shape of the igloo, specifically the catenary arch, distributes weight evenly and increases stability\n    - D: The shape of the igloo causes it to be more susceptible to wind damage\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How could the principles of igloo construction be applied to modern building design to create sustainable shelters?\n    - A: By using metal and glass to build igloos\n    - B: By using snow and ice to build modern houses\n    - C: By incorporating insulating materials and catenary arches into modern building designs\n    - D: By using igloos as a model for designing underwater habitats\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential limitation of using snow as a building material?\n    - A: It is too dense and heavy\n    - B: It is too expensive to harvest and transport\n    - C: It is prone to melting and collapse in warm temperatures\n    - D: It is too difficult to shape and mold\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a potential benefit of using traditional Inuit knowledge in modern construction or design?\n    - A: It would be too expensive and impractical\n    - B: It would not be compatible with modern materials and technologies\n    - C: It would provide valuable insights into sustainable and energy-efficient design\n    - D: It would only be useful for building igloos\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How does the unique structure of an igloo, including its multiple levels and innermost layer, contribute to its ability to retain heat?\n    - A: The structure has no effect on heat retention\n    - B: The structure allows cold air to sink and hot air to rise, increasing heat loss\n    - C: The structure allows hot air to rise and cold air to sink, reducing heat loss\n    - D: The structure is only effective in extremely cold temperatures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
