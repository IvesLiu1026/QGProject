    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of numbers are the launch codes given to Minion A and Minion B?\n    - A: Negative integers\n    - B: Distinct positive integers less than 7\n    - C: Fractions\n    - D: Decimals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What information does Minion A know about the launch codes?\n    - A: The product of the numbers\n    - B: The sum of the numbers\n    - C: The difference between the numbers\n    - D: The ratio of the numbers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What can be inferred about Minion B's number based on Minion A's statement?\n    - A: It is a composite number with multiple factorizations\n    - B: It is a prime number or the product of 1 and the square of a prime\n    - C: It is an even number\n    - D: It is an odd number\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make option A more specific and incorrect.\n\n4) What is the possible range of values for Minion A's number?\n    - A: 1, 2, 3, or 4\n    - B: 3, 4, 5, or 6\n    - C: 5, 6, 7, or 8\n    - D: 2, 4, 6, or 8\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) Which of the following is a real-world scenario where this puzzle can be applied?\n    - A: Two parties negotiating a business deal\n    - B: Two parties trying to deduce each other's information in a game\n    - C: Two parties working together to solve a complex problem\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What concept in game theory is illustrated by this puzzle?\n    - A: Nash equilibrium\n    - B: Pareto optimality\n    - C: Common knowledge\n    - D: Game tree\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between Minion A's and Minion B's statements?\n    - A: Minion A's statement implies that Minion B's number is a prime number\n    - B: Minion A's statement implies that Minion B's number could be a prime number or the product of 1 and the square of a prime\n    - C: Minion A's statement implies that Minion B's number is a composite number\n    - D: Minion A's statement implies that Minion B's number is an even number\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between Minion A's statement and Minion B's response?\n    - A: Minion A's statement causes Minion B to reveal his number\n    - B: Minion A's statement causes Minion B to eliminate certain possibilities\n    - C: Minion A's statement causes Minion B to deduce Minion A's number\n    - D: Minion A's statement causes Minion B to change his strategy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is the solution to the puzzle?\n    - A: Minion A's number is 3 and Minion B's number is 4\n    - B: Minion A's number is 5 and Minion B's number is 4\n    - C: Minion A's number is 4 and Minion B's number is 5\n    - D: Minion A's number is 6 and Minion B's number is 3\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is required to solve the puzzle?\n    - A: Logical reasoning only\n    - B: Creative thinking only\n    - C: A combination of logical reasoning and creative thinking\n    - D: Guesswork\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) Why is it important to evaluate the validity of Minion A's and Minion B's statements?\n    - A: To eliminate certain possibilities\n    - B: To deduce the correct codes\n    - C: To identify potential flaws or limitations in the puzzle\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is required to justify the elimination of certain possibilities?\n    - A: Careful analysis of the statements\n    - B: Guesswork\n    - C: Logical reasoning only\n    - D: Creative thinking only\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
