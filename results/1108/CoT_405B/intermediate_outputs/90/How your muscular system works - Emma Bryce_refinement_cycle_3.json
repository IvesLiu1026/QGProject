    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What percentage of the body's weight is comprised of skeletal muscles?\n    - A: 20-25%\n    - B: 30-40%\n    - C: 45-50%\n    - D: 55-60%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many times does the heart beat over the course of a person's life?\n    - A: 1 billion\n    - B: 2 billion\n    - C: 3 billion\n    - D: 4 billion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary function of the autonomic nervous system in relation to the muscular system?\n    - A: To control voluntary muscle movements\n    - B: To regulate body temperature\n    - C: To control cardiac and smooth muscles\n    - D: To maintain posture\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the main difference between skeletal muscles and cardiac muscles?\n    - A: Skeletal muscles are found in the heart, while cardiac muscles are attached to bones\n    - B: Skeletal muscles are under involuntary control, while cardiac muscles are under voluntary control\n    - C: Skeletal muscles attach to bones, while cardiac muscles are found in the heart\n    - D: Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, while cardiac muscles are responsible for posture\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) An athlete is training for a marathon and wants to optimize their performance. Which system should they focus on understanding to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Nervous system\n    - B: Circulatory system\n    - C: Muscular system\n    - D: Respiratory system\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A person is experiencing muscle spasms in their back and wants to understand the underlying cause. What type of muscle is most likely responsible for this issue?\n    - A: Skeletal muscle\n    - B: Cardiac muscle\n    - C: Smooth muscle\n    - D: Adipose tissue\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between muscle contraction and heat generation in the body?\n    - A: Muscle contraction leads to a decrease in body temperature\n    - B: Muscle contraction has no effect on body temperature\n    - C: Muscle contraction leads to an increase in body temperature\n    - D: Muscle contraction is unrelated to heat generation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers?\n    - A: Fast-twitch fibers are used for endurance activities, while slow-twitch fibers are used for sprinting\n    - B: Fast-twitch fibers are used for sprinting, while slow-twitch fibers are used for endurance activities\n    - C: Fast-twitch fibers are under voluntary control, while slow-twitch fibers are under involuntary control\n    - D: Fast-twitch fibers are found in skeletal muscles, while slow-twitch fibers are found in cardiac muscles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How does the muscular system work together with the nervous system to coordinate movement and maintain posture?\n    - A: The muscular system sends signals to the nervous system to contract or relax muscles\n    - B: The nervous system sends signals to the muscular system to contract or relax muscles\n    - C: The muscular system and nervous system work independently to control movement and posture\n    - D: The muscular system is responsible for movement, while the nervous system is responsible for posture\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the role of the muscular system in regulating body temperature, and how does it achieve this function?\n    - A: The muscular system generates heat through muscle contraction, which helps to regulate body temperature\n    - B: The muscular system helps to dissipate heat through sweating, which helps to regulate body temperature\n    - C: The muscular system has no role in regulating body temperature\n    - D: The muscular system helps to conserve heat through vasoconstriction, which helps to regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why is it essential to prioritize proper physical habits and injury prevention strategies in relation to the muscular system?\n    - A: To improve cardiovascular health\n    - B: To reduce the risk of muscle-related injuries and disorders\n    - C: To enhance athletic performance\n    - D: To maintain healthy bones\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the significance of the muscular system in our daily lives, and why is it often overlooked?\n    - A: The muscular system is insignificant in our daily lives and is often overlooked because it is not visible\n    - B: The muscular system is crucial for movement and posture, but is often overlooked because it is not directly visible\n    - C: The muscular system is only important for athletic performance and is often overlooked because it is not relevant to everyday life\n    - D: The muscular system is not important for overall health and is often overlooked because it is not a priority\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAfter reviewing the questions, I did not make any significant changes as they are already clear, concise, and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
