Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many people worldwide are affected by asthma?\n    - A: 100 million\n    - B: 300 million\n    - C: 500 million\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary treatment for managing asthma symptoms?\n    - A: Oral medications\n    - B: Inhalers\n    - C: Surgery\n    - D: Physical therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary characteristic of asthma?\n    - A: A temporary condition caused by a viral infection\n    - B: A chronic condition characterized by inflammation and hyper-responsiveness of the airways\n    - C: A condition that only affects the lungs\n    - D: A condition that can be cured with medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the airways during an asthma attack?\n    - A: They expand and become less inflamed\n    - B: They constrict and become more inflamed\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They become infected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can help prevent asthma attacks?\n    - A: Increasing exposure to triggers\n    - B: Reducing exposure to triggers\n    - C: Stopping the use of inhalers\n    - D: Ignoring symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can individuals effectively manage their asthma condition?\n    - A: By understanding the causes and triggers of asthma, and using inhalers as prescribed\n    - B: By ignoring symptoms and not using inhalers\n    - C: By only using reliever medications\n    - D: By not seeking medical attention\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between asthma triggers and the resulting inflammation and airway constriction?\n    - A: Triggers have no effect on inflammation and airway constriction\n    - B: Triggers reduce inflammation and airway constriction\n    - C: Triggers cause inflammation and airway constriction\n    - D: Triggers only affect the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between reliever medications and preventive medications?\n    - A: Reliever medications provide long-term control, while preventive medications provide immediate relief\n    - B: Reliever medications provide immediate relief, while preventive medications provide long-term control\n    - C: Reliever medications are used for severe asthma attacks, while preventive medications are used for mild asthma attacks\n    - D: Reliever medications are used for mild asthma attacks, while preventive medications are used for severe asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the best approach to managing asthma?\n    - A: Only using reliever medications\n    - B: Only using preventive medications\n    - C: Combining knowledge of asthma triggers and the effects of inhalers to develop a comprehensive treatment plan\n    - D: Ignoring symptoms and not using inhalers\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is essential for creating a personalized management strategy for asthma?\n    - A: Understanding the causes, symptoms, and triggers of asthma\n    - B: Ignoring the causes and symptoms of asthma\n    - C: Only using reliever medications\n    - D: Only using preventive medications\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How effective are inhalers in controlling and preventing asthma symptoms?\n    - A: Not effective at all\n    - B: Somewhat effective\n    - C: Very effective\n    - D: Extremely effective, but only for severe asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the impact of poverty and environmental factors on asthma incidence and management?\n    - A: They have no impact\n    - B: They reduce asthma incidence and improve management\n    - C: They can increase asthma incidence and worsen management\n    - D: They only affect the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nThese refined questions align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have accurate correct answers. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, making them suitable for a multiple-choice assessment."
