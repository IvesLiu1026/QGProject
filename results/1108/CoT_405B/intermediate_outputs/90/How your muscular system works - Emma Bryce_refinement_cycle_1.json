    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many muscles work together to lift, propel, and set down the foot when taking a step?\n    - A: 100 muscles\n    - B: 200 muscles\n    - C: 300 muscles\n    - D: 400 muscles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the body's weight is comprised of skeletal muscles?\n    - A: 10-20%\n    - B: 30-40%\n    - C: 50-60%\n    - D: 70-80%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the muscular system in the human body?\n    - A: To regulate body temperature and circulate blood\n    - B: To enable movement, maintain posture, and regulate bodily functions\n    - C: To digest food and absorb nutrients\n    - D: To produce hormones and maintain homeostasis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Which type of nervous system controls cardiac and smooth muscles?\n    - A: Somatic nervous system\n    - B: Autonomic nervous system\n    - C: Central nervous system\n    - D: Peripheral nervous system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can understanding the muscular system help athletes train more effectively?\n    - A: By developing more slow-twitch muscles in their legs for endurance\n    - B: By engaging and relaxing different muscle groups to maintain good posture\n    - C: By developing more fast-twitch muscles in their legs for sprinting\n    - D: By ignoring the importance of physical activity in maintaining overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is one way that understanding the muscular system can help individuals appreciate the importance of physical activity in maintaining overall health?\n    - A: By highlighting the role of the muscular system in regulating body temperature\n    - B: By emphasizing the importance of developing fast-twitch muscles\n    - C: By explaining how physical activity helps maintain muscle mass and strength\n    - D: By focusing on the role of the muscular system in enabling bodily functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between skeletal muscles and the somatic nervous system?\n    - A: The somatic nervous system controls cardiac and smooth muscles\n    - B: The somatic nervous system gives us almost complete control over skeletal muscle movements\n    - C: The somatic nervous system regulates body temperature\n    - D: The somatic nervous system enables movement and maintains bodily functions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main difference between fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers?\n    - A: Fast-twitch fibers are used for endurance activities, while slow-twitch fibers are used for sprinting\n    - B: Fast-twitch fibers are used for sprinting, while slow-twitch fibers are used for endurance activities\n    - C: Fast-twitch fibers are used for regulating body temperature, while slow-twitch fibers are used for enabling bodily functions\n    - D: Fast-twitch fibers are used for enabling bodily functions, while slow-twitch fibers are used for regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be gained by combining knowledge of the muscular system with an understanding of the nervous system?\n    - A: Insights into how the body coordinates movement and maintains bodily functions\n    - B: An understanding of the importance of developing fast-twitch muscles\n    - C: An appreciation for the role of the muscular system in regulating body temperature\n    - D: A deeper understanding of the importance of ignoring physical activity in maintaining overall health\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be gained by integrating information about the different types of muscles and their functions?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of the muscular system\n    - B: An understanding of the importance of developing slow-twitch muscles\n    - C: An appreciation for the role of the muscular system in enabling bodily functions\n    - D: Insights into how the body regulates body temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) Why is the muscular system important in enabling bodily functions and maintaining overall health?\n    - A: Because it regulates body temperature, enables movement, and maintains posture\n    - B: Because it circulates blood and oxygen and digests food and absorbs nutrients\n    - C: Because it gives us almost complete control over skeletal muscle movements\n    - D: Because it is responsible for generating about 85% of the body's warmth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is one way to justify the need for regular physical activity in maintaining muscular health and preventing injuries?\n    - A: By highlighting the importance of developing fast-twitch muscles\n    - B: By emphasizing the role of the muscular system in regulating body temperature\n    - C: By explaining how physical activity helps maintain muscle mass and strength\n    - D: By ignoring the importance of physical activity in maintaining overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. No major changes were necessary, and the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript."
