    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge:**\n\n1. Scientists cracked open the nucleus of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy in Chicago during World War II.\n2. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household for nearly 34 years.\n3. Nuclear power has declined from an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today.\n4. The atomic nucleus is densely packed with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force.\n5. Most uranium atoms have a total of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140 lacks three neutrons.\n6. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down neutrons.\n7. Modern reactors commonly use purified water as a moderator.\n8. The concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times its natural abundance to keep up the chain reaction.\n9. Enrichment is often done by passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges.\n10. Radioactive fission products decay into stable elements, with some decaying in a few seconds and others taking hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The ability to mine great amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian source of electricity.\n2. Nuclear power relies on the fission of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting in many more nuclei.\n3. The neutron-led chain reaction is a potent process driving nuclear power, but it has unique demands on the production of its fuel.\n4. The greatest challenge for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain radioactive fission products and keep them from harming humans or the environment.\n5. Containment doesn't stop mattering once the fuel is used up; it becomes an even greater storage problem.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Nuclear power plants can be used to generate electricity for households and industries.\n2. The technology used to enrich uranium for nuclear power can also be used to create bomb-grade fuel.\n3. The storage of spent fuel is a significant problem, and deep time storage in tunnels drilled far underground has been proposed as a solution.\n4. The security risks associated with storing spent fuel, including the potential for plutonium to be mined and used to make bombs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between the concentration of U-235 and the rate of fission in a nuclear reactor.\n2. The contrast between the potential benefits of nuclear power and the risks and challenges associated with its production and storage.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the failure of a reactor's cooling system and the potential for a meltdown.\n4. The trade-offs between the benefits of nuclear power and the costs and risks associated with its production and storage.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining the ideas of nuclear power and renewable energy sources to create a more sustainable energy mix.\n2. Integrating the concepts of nuclear safety and security to develop more effective strategies for managing the risks associated with nuclear power.\n3. Considering the long-term implications of nuclear power production and storage, including the potential for environmental and health impacts.\n4. Developing new technologies and strategies for managing the challenges associated with nuclear power, such as advanced reactor designs and more effective waste storage systems.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of current nuclear safety and security measures in preventing accidents and mitigating their impacts.\n2. Assessing the potential risks and benefits of different nuclear power technologies, including advanced reactor designs and small modular reactors.\n3. Justifying the use of nuclear power as a source of electricity, considering its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n4. Critiquing the current approaches to nuclear waste storage and disposal, and proposing alternative solutions."
