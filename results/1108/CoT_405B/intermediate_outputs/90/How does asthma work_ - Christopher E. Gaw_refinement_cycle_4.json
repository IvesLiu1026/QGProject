    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many people worldwide are affected by asthma?\n    - A: 100 million\n    - B: 300 million\n    - C: 500 million\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the primary treatment for managing asthma symptoms?\n    - A: Oral medications\n    - B: Inhalers\n    - C: Surgery\n    - D: Lifestyle changes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option D to make it a more plausible distractor.\n\n3) What is the primary characteristic of asthma?\n    - A: A temporary condition caused by a viral infection\n    - B: A chronic condition characterized by inflammation and hyper-responsiveness of the airways\n    - C: A condition that only affects the lungs\n    - D: A condition that can be cured with medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What happens to the airways during an asthma attack?\n    - A: They expand and become less inflamed\n    - B: They constrict and become more inflamed\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They become infected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What can help prevent asthma attacks?\n    - A: Reducing physical activity\n    - B: Reducing exposure to triggers\n    - C: Stopping the use of inhalers\n    - D: Ignoring symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined option A to make it a more plausible distractor.\n\n6) How can individuals effectively manage their asthma condition?\n    - A: By understanding the causes and triggers of asthma, and using inhalers as prescribed\n    - B: By relying solely on reliever medications\n    - C: By monitoring symptoms and adjusting treatment plans accordingly\n    - D: By not seeking medical attention\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined option C to make it a more plausible distractor.\n\n7) What is the relationship between asthma triggers and the resulting inflammation and airway constriction?\n    - A: Triggers have no effect on inflammation and airway constriction\n    - B: Triggers reduce inflammation and airway constriction\n    - C: Triggers cause inflammation and airway constriction\n    - D: Triggers only affect the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the main difference between reliever medications and preventive medications?\n    - A: Reliever medications provide long-term control, while preventive medications provide immediate relief\n    - B: Reliever medications provide immediate relief, while preventive medications provide long-term control\n    - C: Reliever medications are used for severe asthma attacks, while preventive medications are used for mild asthma attacks\n    - D: Reliever medications are used for mild asthma attacks, while preventive medications are used for severe asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is essential for creating a personalized management strategy for asthma?\n    - A: Understanding the causes, symptoms, and triggers of asthma\n    - B: Understanding only the symptoms of asthma\n    - C: Understanding only the triggers of asthma\n    - D: Ignoring the causes and symptoms of asthma\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined options B and C to make them more plausible distractors.\n\n10) How effective are inhalers in controlling and preventing asthma symptoms?\n    - A: Not effective at all\n    - B: Somewhat effective\n    - C: Very effective\n    - D: Extremely effective, but only for severe asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the impact of poverty and environmental factors on asthma incidence and management?\n    - A: They have no impact\n    - B: They reduce asthma incidence and improve management\n    - C: They can increase asthma incidence and worsen management\n    - D: They only affect the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What happens to the air in the lungs during an asthma attack?\n    - A: It is expelled more easily\n    - B: It becomes trapped, leading to hyperinflation\n    - C: It is absorbed by the body\n    - D: It is not affected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNew question added to cover a key concept in the transcript.\n\n13) What is the role of corticosteroids in asthma management?\n    - A: They provide immediate relief during an asthma attack\n    - B: They reduce airway sensitivity and inflammation\n    - C: They are used to treat only severe asthma attacks\n    - D: They are used to treat only mild asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNew question added to cover a key concept in the transcript.\n\n14) Why is it essential to understand the causes and triggers of asthma?\n    - A: To develop a cure for asthma\n    - B: To create a personalized management strategy\n    - C: To reduce the use of inhalers\n    - D: To ignore symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNew question added to cover a key concept in the transcript.\n\n15) What is the relationship between asthma and the respiratory system?\n    - A: Asthma affects only the lungs\n    - B: Asthma affects the entire respiratory system\n    - C: Asthma has no impact on the respiratory system\n    - D: Asthma affects only the airways\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNew question added to cover a key concept in the transcript."
