    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Creative constraints are the requirements and limitations that need to be addressed to accomplish a goal.\n2. Constraints play a crucial role in various professions, including architecture, art, writing, engineering, and science.\n3. The scientific process involves considering constraints as part of experimental design.\n4. The Viking 1 and 2 landers used thrusters, which contaminated Martian soil samples.\n5. The Pathfinder mission used an airbag system to land on Mars without introducing chemicals from Earth.\n6. The Curiosity rover was too large for the airbag design, leading to the development of a skycrane landing system.\n7. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin through a mistake in the lab.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The concept of creative freedom can be overwhelming without guidance or constraints.\n2. Constraints serve as drivers of discovery and invention in various fields.\n3. The scientific process involves recognizing the limitations of current technology to advance it.\n4. Engineers and scientists use constraints to guide decision-making and ensure objectives are met.\n5. The development of innovative solutions can lead to unexpected applications in other fields.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Designing a water filtration system for astronauts on Mars could lead to applications in drought-stricken regions or polluted cities.\n2. The discovery of penicillin, synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder demonstrate how mistakes can lead to breakthroughs in other areas.\n3. The concept of constraints can be applied to various fields, such as architecture, art, and writing, to drive creativity and innovation.\n4.
