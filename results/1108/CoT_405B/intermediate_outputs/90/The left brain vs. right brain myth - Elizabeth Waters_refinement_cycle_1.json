    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure alignment with key concepts, clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which part of the brain controls the motion of the left arm and leg?\n    - A: The left side of the brain\n    - B: The right side of the brain\n    - C: The brain stem\n    - D: The thalamus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who suggested that language is controlled by the left side of the brain in the mid-1800s?\n    - A: Broca and Wernicke\n    - B: Robert Louis Stevenson\n    - C: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n    - D: Neurologists in the 1900s\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) How do the brain's left and right sides work together to control movement and sight?\n    - A: They work independently to control different body functions\n    - B: They work together, with each side controlling the opposite side of the body\n    - C: The left side controls movement, and the right side controls sight\n    - D: The right side controls movement, and the left side controls sight\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the scientific evidence for the concept of a left-right split in brain function regarding logic and creativity?\n    - A: It is supported by numerous studies and research\n    - B: It is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence\n    - C: It is a relatively new concept that requires further research\n    - D: It is a widely accepted theory in the scientific community\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential application of understanding how the brain processes visual information?\n    - A: Developing treatments for hearing impairments\n    - B: Developing treatments for visual impairments\n    - C: Developing therapies for motor disorders\n    - D: Understanding the neural basis of visual perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of recognizing that logic and creativity are not mutually exclusive?\n    - A: Developing treatments for attention disorders\n    - B: Developing therapies for motor disorders\n    - C: Developing education and problem-solving strategies that integrate logic and creativity\n    - D: Developing treatments for visual impairments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brain's left and right sides and their respective functions?\n    - A: The left side controls logic, and the right side controls creativity\n    - B: The left side controls language, and the right side controls attention\n    - C: The brain's left and right sides work together to control movement and sight\n    - D: The brain's left and right sides have distinct functions that are not yet fully understood\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between the popular idea of a left-right split in brain function and the scientific evidence?\n    - A: The popular idea is supported by scientific evidence\n    - B: The popular idea is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence\n    - C: The scientific evidence is inconclusive, and more research is needed\n    - D: The popular idea is an oversimplification of the brain's functions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can combining the understanding of the brain's left and right sides with the concept of logic and creativity be applied?\n    - A: Developing new approaches to problem-solving that integrate logic and creativity\n    - B: Developing treatments for visual impairments\n    - C: Developing therapies for motor disorders\n    - D: Developing education strategies for attention disorders\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is a potential outcome of integrating the knowledge of the brain's visual processing with the concept of attention?\n    - A: Developing new treatments for hearing impairments\n    - B: Developing new treatments for attention disorders\n    - C: Developing therapies for motor disorders\n    - D: Developing education strategies for logic and creativity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the validity of the popular idea of a left-right split in brain function based on scientific evidence?\n    - A: It is a widely accepted theory in the scientific community\n    - B: It is a relatively new concept that requires further research\n    - C: It is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence\n    - D: It is an oversimplification of the brain's functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential critique of the oversimplification of the brain's functions?\n    - A: It is a necessary simplification for education and problem-solving strategies\n    - B: It is a harmless myth with no implications for real-life applications\n    - C: It can lead to ineffective treatments and therapies\n    - D: It is a widely accepted theory in the scientific community\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12. Minor adjustments were made to questions 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 to improve clarity and conciseness."
