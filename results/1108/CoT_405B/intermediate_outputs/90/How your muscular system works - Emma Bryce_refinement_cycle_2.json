    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many muscles work together to lift, propel, and set down the foot when taking a step?\n    - A: 100 muscles\n    - B: 200 muscles\n    - C: 300 muscles\n    - D: 400 muscles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the body's weight is comprised of skeletal muscles?\n    - A: 10-20%\n    - B: 30-40%\n    - C: 50-60%\n    - D: 70-80%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the muscular system in the human body?\n    - A: To regulate body temperature and circulate blood\n    - B: To enable movement, maintain posture, and regulate bodily functions\n    - C: To digest food and absorb nutrients\n    - D: To produce hormones and maintain homeostasis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Which type of nervous system controls cardiac and smooth muscles?\n    - A: Somatic nervous system\n    - B: Autonomic nervous system\n    - C: Central nervous system\n    - D: Peripheral nervous system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the main difference between fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers?\n    - A: Fast-twitch fibers are used for endurance activities, while slow-twitch fibers are used for sprinting\n    - B: Fast-twitch fibers are used for sprinting, while slow-twitch fibers are used for endurance activities\n    - C: Fast-twitch fibers are used for regulating body temperature, while slow-twitch fibers are used for enabling bodily functions\n    - D: Fast-twitch fibers are used for enabling bodily functions, while slow-twitch fibers are used for regulating body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the relationship between skeletal muscles and the somatic nervous system?\n    - A: The somatic nervous system controls cardiac and smooth muscles\n    - B: The somatic nervous system gives us almost complete control over skeletal muscle movements\n    - C: The somatic nervous system regulates body temperature\n    - D: The somatic nervous system enables movement and maintains bodily functions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What can be gained by combining knowledge of the muscular system with an understanding of the nervous system?\n    - A: Insights into how the body coordinates movement and maintains bodily functions\n    - B: An understanding of the importance of developing fast-twitch muscles\n    - C: An appreciation for the role of the muscular system in regulating body temperature\n    - D: A deeper understanding of the importance of ignoring physical activity in maintaining overall health\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can be gained by integrating information about the different types of muscles and their functions?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of the muscular system\n    - B: An understanding of the importance of developing slow-twitch muscles\n    - C: An appreciation for the role of the muscular system in enabling bodily functions\n    - D: Insights into how the body regulates body temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) Why is the muscular system important in enabling bodily functions and maintaining overall health?\n    - A: Because it regulates body temperature, enables movement, and maintains posture\n    - B: Because it circulates blood and oxygen and digests food and absorbs nutrients\n    - C: Because it gives us almost complete control over skeletal muscle movements\n    - D: Because it is responsible for generating about 85% of the body's warmth\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is one way to justify the need for regular physical activity in maintaining muscular health and preventing injuries?\n    - A: By highlighting the importance of developing fast-twitch muscles\n    - B: By emphasizing the role of the muscular system in regulating body temperature\n    - C: By explaining how physical activity helps maintain muscle mass and strength\n    - D: By ignoring the importance of physical activity in maintaining overall health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were similar to questions 9 and 10. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
