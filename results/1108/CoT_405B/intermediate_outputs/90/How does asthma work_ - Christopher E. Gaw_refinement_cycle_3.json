    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Approximately how many people worldwide are affected by asthma?\n    - A: 100 million\n    - B: 300 million\n    - C: 500 million\n    - D: 1 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary treatment for managing asthma symptoms?\n    - A: Oral medications\n    - B: Inhalers\n    - C: Surgery\n    - D: Physical therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary characteristic of asthma?\n    - A: A temporary condition caused by a viral infection\n    - B: A chronic condition characterized by inflammation and hyper-responsiveness of the airways\n    - C: A condition that only affects the lungs\n    - D: A condition that can be cured with medication\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the airways during an asthma attack?\n    - A: They expand and become less inflamed\n    - B: They constrict and become more inflamed\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They become infected\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can help prevent asthma attacks?\n    - A: Increasing exposure to triggers\n    - B: Reducing exposure to triggers\n    - C: Stopping the use of inhalers\n    - D: Ignoring symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can individuals effectively manage their asthma condition?\n    - A: By understanding the causes and triggers of asthma, and using inhalers as prescribed\n    - B: By relying solely on reliever medications\n    - C: By ignoring symptoms and not using inhalers\n    - D: By not seeking medical attention\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between asthma triggers and the resulting inflammation and airway constriction?\n    - A: Triggers have no effect on inflammation and airway constriction\n    - B: Triggers reduce inflammation and airway constriction\n    - C: Triggers cause inflammation and airway constriction\n    - D: Triggers only affect the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between reliever medications and preventive medications?\n    - A: Reliever medications provide long-term control, while preventive medications provide immediate relief\n    - B: Reliever medications provide immediate relief, while preventive medications provide long-term control\n    - C: Reliever medications are used for severe asthma attacks, while preventive medications are used for mild asthma attacks\n    - D: Reliever medications are used for mild asthma attacks, while preventive medications are used for severe asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is essential for creating a personalized management strategy for asthma?\n    - A: Understanding the causes, symptoms, and triggers of asthma\n    - B: Ignoring the causes and symptoms of asthma\n    - C: Only using reliever medications\n    - D: Only using preventive medications\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How effective are inhalers in controlling and preventing asthma symptoms?\n    - A: Not effective at all\n    - B: Somewhat effective\n    - C: Very effective\n    - D: Extremely effective, but only for severe asthma attacks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the impact of poverty and environmental factors on asthma incidence and management?\n    - A: They have no impact\n    - B: They reduce asthma incidence and improve management\n    - C: They can increase asthma incidence and worsen management\n    - D: They only affect the lungs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 10, 11, 12, and 14 from the initial set as they were redundant or similar to other questions. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. No more refinement is needed for the remaining questions."
