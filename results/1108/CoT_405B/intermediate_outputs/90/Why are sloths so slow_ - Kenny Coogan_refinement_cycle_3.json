Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year did Thomas Jefferson receive a box of unidentified bones that he believed might belong to a huge unknown species of North American lion?\n    - A: 1795\n    - B: 1796\n    - C: 1797\n    - D: 1798\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many species of sloths are currently living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America?\n    - A: 4\n    - B: 5\n    - C: 6\n    - D: 7\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What did Thomas Jefferson initially think the unidentified bones belonged to?\n    - A: A huge unknown species of North American bear\n    - B: A huge unknown species of North American lion\n    - C: A huge unknown species of North American elephant\n    - D: A huge unknown species of North American giraffe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What factors may have contributed to the extinction of ground sloths?\n    - A: Only an oncoming ice age\n    - B: Only competition with other species\n    - C: Only human activity\n    - D: An oncoming ice age, competition with other species, and/or human activity\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What can be inferred about the potential impact of human activity on the environment from the extinction of ground sloths?\n    - A: Human activity has no impact on the environment\n    - B: Human activity can only positively impact the environment\n    - C: Human activity can have a significant negative impact on the environment\n    - D: Human activity is the only factor that affects the environment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How do sloths adapt to their diet of leaves, which is low in energy?\n    - A: By increasing their energy expenditure and metabolism\n    - B: By decreasing their energy expenditure and metabolism\n    - C: By maintaining a constant energy expenditure and metabolism\n    - D: By supplementing their diet with high-energy foods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the possible relationship between the extinction of ground sloths and the arrival of humans in the Americas?\n    - A: There is no relationship between the two events\n    - B: The arrival of humans in the Americas directly caused the extinction of ground sloths\n    - C: The extinction of ground sloths directly caused the arrival of humans in the Americas\n    - D: The arrival of humans in the Americas may have contributed to the extinction of ground sloths\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) How often do sloths typically descend from the canopy to the forest floor?\n    - A: Daily\n    - B: Weekly\n    - C: Monthly\n    - D: Rarely\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is unique about the body temperature of sloths compared to other mammals?\n    - A: It remains constant\n    - B: It fluctuates by about 1 degree Celsius\n    - C: It fluctuates by about 5 degrees Celsius\n    - D: It is always higher than the ambient temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is studying sloths and their unique adaptations important in the context of environmentalism and conservation?\n    - A: Studying sloths is unnecessary because they are not an important species\n    - B: Studying sloths is only important for understanding their unique adaptations\n    - C: Studying sloths is crucial for understanding the importance of conservation and preserving biodiversity\n    - D: Studying sloths is only important for understanding their role in maintaining ecosystem balance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the main advantage of sloths' slow metabolism?\n    - A: It allows them to move quickly\n    - B: It enables them to eat a diverse diet\n    - C: It helps them conserve energy\n    - D: It makes them more vulnerable to predators\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How do sloths contribute to the spread of avocado trees?\n    - A: By dispersing seeds through their droppings\n    - B: By eating the leaves of avocado trees\n    - C: By competing with other herbivores for food\n    - D: By providing shade for avocado trees\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
