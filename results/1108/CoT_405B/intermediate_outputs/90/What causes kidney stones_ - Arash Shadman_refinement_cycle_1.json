    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the largest recorded size of a kidney stone?\n    - A: 5 millimeters in diameter\n    - B: 500 grams and 10 centimeters in diameter\n    - C: 1 kilogram and 17 centimeters in diameter\n    - D: 2 kilograms and 20 centimeters in diameter\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the most common type of kidney stone?\n    - A: Uric acid\n    - B: Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate)\n    - C: Calcium phosphate\n    - D: Calcium oxalate\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the primary cause of kidney stone formation?\n    - A: Bacterial infections\n    - B: Genetic disorders\n    - C: Imbalance of particles in urine, such as high levels or abnormal pH\n    - D: Certain medications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why can kidney stones go undetected until they start to move?\n    - A: Because they are too small to cause symptoms\n    - B: Because they are too large to pass through the urinary tract\n    - C: Because they do not cause symptoms until they obstruct the flow of urine\n    - D: Because they are not detectable by medical imaging tests\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What dietary change can help prevent kidney stones?\n    - A: Increasing consumption of foods high in oxalate\n    - B: Decreasing consumption of foods high in oxalate\n    - C: Drinking less water\n    - D: Reducing calcium intake\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What treatment option can be used to help alleviate symptoms and facilitate the passage of a kidney stone?\n    - A: Surgery\n    - B: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\n    - C: Medications like alpha blockers or potassium citrate\n    - D: Drinking plenty of water\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the size of a kidney stone and the severity of symptoms?\n    - A: Larger stones cause fewer symptoms\n    - B: Smaller stones cause more severe symptoms\n    - C: The size of the stone is directly related to the severity of symptoms\n    - D: Larger stones are more likely to cause severe symptoms, but size is not the only factor\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the primary difference between calcium oxalate and uric acid kidney stones?\n    - A: Calcium oxalate stones are caused by bacterial infections, while uric acid stones are caused by genetic disorders\n    - B: Calcium oxalate stones are more common, while uric acid stones are less common\n    - C: Calcium oxalate stones are composed of calcium and oxalate, while uric acid stones are composed of uric acid\n    - D: Calcium oxalate stones are more likely to cause symptoms, while uric acid stones are less likely to cause symptoms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a comprehensive plan for preventing and managing kidney stones?\n    - A: Drinking plenty of water and taking painkillers\n    - B: Limiting consumption of foods high in oxalate and taking medications like alpha blockers or potassium citrate\n    - C: Combining dietary changes, medications, and treatment options like extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\n    - D: Having surgery to remove the stone\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can personalized dietary recommendations be developed for individuals prone to kidney stones?\n    - A: By considering the individual's medical history and dietary habits\n    - B: By evaluating the effectiveness of different treatment options\n    - C: By combining knowledge of kidney stone formation and treatment options\n    - D: By assessing the impact of dietary changes on the formation and recurrence of kidney stones\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the most effective treatment option for medium-sized kidney stones?\n    - A: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\n    - B: Surgery\n    - C: Drinking plenty of water and taking painkillers\n    - D: Medications like alpha blockers or potassium citrate\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the justification for using medications like alpha blockers or potassium citrate in the treatment of kidney stones?\n    - A: They help alleviate symptoms and facilitate the passage of the stone\n    - B: They are more effective than extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\n    - C: They are less expensive than surgery\n    - D: They have fewer side effects than other treatment options\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
