A: 1795\n    - B: 1796\n    - C: 1797\n    - D: 1798\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many species of sloths are left living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America?\n    - A: 4\n    - B: 5\n    - C: 6\n    - D: 7\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What did Thomas Jefferson initially think the bones belonged to?\n    - A: A huge unknown species of North American bear\n    - B: A huge unknown species of North American lion\n    - C: A huge unknown species of North American elephant\n    - D: A huge unknown species of North American giraffe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What may have caused the extinction of ground sloths?\n    - A: Only an oncoming ice age\n    - B: Only competition with other species\n    - C: Only human activity\n    - D: An oncoming ice age, competition with other species, or human activity\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) What can we learn from the extinction of ground sloths about the impact of human activity on the environment?\n    - A: That human activity has no impact on the environment\n    - B: That human activity can only positively impact the environment\n    - C: That human activity can have a significant negative impact on the environment\n    - D: That human activity is the only factor that affects the environment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do sloths' unique physical and behavioral adaptations inspire innovation in fields like conservation and ecology?\n    - A: By providing examples of inefficient energy use\n    - B: By providing examples of high-speed movement\n    - C: By providing examples of finely tuned strategies to cope with restricted diets\n    - D: By providing examples of wasteful resource use\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the extinction of ground sloths and the arrival of humans in the Americas?\n    - A: There is no relationship between the two events\n    - B: The arrival of humans in the Americas directly caused the extinction of ground sloths\n    - C: The extinction of ground sloths directly caused the arrival of humans in the Americas\n    - D: The arrival of humans in the Americas may have contributed to the extinction of ground sloths\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How does sloths' diet of leaves affect their energy expenditure and metabolism?\n    - A: It increases their energy expenditure and metabolism\n    - B: It decreases their energy expenditure and metabolism\n    - C: It has no effect on their energy expenditure and metabolism\n    - D: It only affects their energy expenditure, not their metabolism\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How do sloths' unique adaptations to their environment relate to their role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems?\n    - A: Their adaptations have no impact on their role in maintaining ecosystem balance\n    - B: Their adaptations hinder their ability to maintain ecosystem balance\n    - C: Their adaptations enable them to play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance\n    - D: Their adaptations only affect their ability to adapt to new environments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What can we learn from the study of sloths about the importance of conservation and preserving biodiversity?\n    - A: That conservation and preserving biodiversity are unnecessary\n    - B: That conservation and preserving biodiversity are only important for certain species\n    - C: That conservation and preserving biodiversity are crucial for maintaining ecosystem balance\n    - D: That conservation and preserving biodiversity are only important for species with high metabolic rates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Evaluate the impact of human activity on the extinction of ground sloths and the importance of conservation efforts to protect modern-day sloths.\n    - A: Human activity had no impact on the extinction of ground sloths, and conservation efforts are unnecessary\n    - B: Human activity had a significant impact on the extinction of ground sloths, and conservation efforts are crucial\n    - C: Human activity had a minor impact on the extinction of ground sloths, and conservation efforts are only somewhat important\n    - D: Human activity was the only factor that led to the extinction of ground sloths, and conservation efforts are only necessary for certain species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Justify the importance of studying sloths and their unique adaptations in the context of environmentalism and conservation.\n    - A: Studying sloths is unnecessary because they are not an important species\n    - B: Studying sloths is only important for understanding their unique adaptations\n    - C: Studying sloths is crucial for understanding the importance of conservation and preserving biodiversity\n    - D: Studying sloths is only important for understanding their role in maintaining ecosystem balance\n[Correct answer]: C"
