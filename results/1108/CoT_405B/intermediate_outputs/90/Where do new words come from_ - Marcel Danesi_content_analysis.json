    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The Oxford English Dictionary adds around 1,000 new words each year.\n2. The English language has over 170,000 words currently in use.\n3. Nearly half of the English vocabulary comes directly from other languages.\n4. Examples of borrowed words include altar, jury, coffee, spaghetti, curry, naïveté, machismo, and schadenfreude.\n5. The word \"clone\" was derived from the Ancient Greek word for twig.\n6. English lends words like \"software\" to languages worldwide.\n7. Compound words are formed by combining two whole words (e.g., airport, starfish).\n8. Clipping and blending parts of words can create new words (e.g., spork, brunch, internet).\n9. Obsolete words can gain new life by adopting new meanings (e.g., villain, geek).\n10. The word \"meme\" was coined by Richard Dawkins in the 1970s from the Ancient Greek for imitation.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The English language evolves as new ideas, inventions, and scientific progress create gaps in expression.\n2. Words can be formed through various methods, including borrowing from other languages, combining existing words, and adopting new meanings.\n3. The process of word creation is not solely top-down, but rather emerges from ordinary people spreading words that are useful and catchy.\n4. Dictionaries document current usage, but do not dictate the creation of new words.\n5. The journey of words from creation to becoming part of everyday speech reveals aspects of human communication and culture.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. How might a new scientific discovery lead to the creation of a new word?\n2. In what ways do cultural exchange and globalization influence the adoption of words from other languages?\n3. Can you think of a recent example of a word that has gained a new meaning or become popular through internet usage?\n4. How might a company or organization use language to create a brand identity or promote a new product?\n5. In what contexts might the concept of autological words (words that describe themselves) be relevant?\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. Compare and contrast the different methods of word creation (borrowing, combining, adopting new meanings).\n2. How do historical and cultural contexts influence the adoption and evolution of words?\n3. What role does technology (e.g., the internet) play in the dissemination and popularization of new words?\n4. Analyze the relationship between language and culture, including how words reflect and shape societal values and norms.\n5. Examine the tension between the need for new words to describe emerging concepts and the potential for language to become overly complex or fragmented.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. How might the concept of memes be applied to understand the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena beyond language?\n2. In what ways do the processes of word creation and language evolution reflect broader societal and cultural trends?\n3. Can you think of a new word or concept that combines elements from multiple languages or cultural traditions?\n4. How might the study of language evolution inform our understanding of human creativity, innovation, and problem-solving?\n5. What implications do the autological nature of words like \"meme\" have for our understanding of language and culture?\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Assess the significance of language academies and dictionaries in shaping the English language.\n2. Evaluate the impact of technological advancements on the creation and dissemination of new words.\n3. Justify the importance of understanding language evolution in the context of cultural and societal change.\n4. Critique the notion that language is solely a reflection of culture, arguing for or against the idea that language can also shape culture.\n5. Argue for or against the idea that the proliferation of new words and meanings is a positive or negative development in the English language."
