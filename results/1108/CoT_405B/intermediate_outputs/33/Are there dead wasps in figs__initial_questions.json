    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is unique about the way fig wasps enter young figs?\n    - A: They enter through a large opening at the top.\n    - B: They enter through a tiny opening at the bottom.\n    - C: They enter through a hole made by other wasps.\n    - D: They do not enter the fig at all.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many species of figs are there?\n    - A: Over 100\n    - B: Over 500\n    - C: Over 750\n    - D: Over 1000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What is the role of fig wasps in the pollination process of figs?\n    - A: They only lay eggs inside the fig.\n    - B: They only pollinate the fig.\n    - C: They lay eggs inside the fig and also pollinate it.\n    - D: They have no role in pollination.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is unique about the common fig compared to other species?\n    - A: It requires pollination by fig wasps.\n    - B: It does not require pollination in the same way as other species.\n    - C: It is the only species of fig that is edible.\n    - D: It is the largest species of fig.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) Why is it important to understand the unique pollination process of figs?\n    - A: So we can grow more figs.\n    - B: So we can appreciate the complexity of ecosystems and the interconnectedness of species.\n    - C: So we can eliminate fig wasps.\n    - D: So we can eat more figs.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can recognizing the role of fig wasps in pollination inform agricultural practices?\n    - A: By eliminating the need for pesticides.\n    - B: By reducing the need for fertilizers.\n    - C: By informing conservation efforts and agricultural practices.\n    - D: By increasing crop yields.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What type of relationship exists between figs and fig wasps?\n    - A: Parasitic\n    - B: Mutualistic\n    - C: Commensal\n    - D: Symbiotic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the fig wasp's actions and the pollination of the fig?\n    - A: The fig wasp's actions have no effect on pollination.\n    - B: The fig wasp's actions lead to the pollination of the fig.\n    - C: The fig wasp's actions prevent pollination.\n    - D: The fig wasp's actions delay pollination.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can the unique pollination process of figs be seen in a broader context?\n    - A: As a microcosm of the interconnectedness of species in ecosystems.\n    - B: As a unique exception to the rule of pollination.\n    - C: As a way to increase crop yields.\n    - D: As a way to eliminate pests.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can the domestication of figs be used as an example of?\n    - A: How human activity can harm the natural world.\n    - B: How human activity can shape the natural world and lead to new species.\n    - C: How human activity has no impact on the natural world.\n    - D: How human activity can only benefit the natural world.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Is the relationship between figs and fig wasps an example of mutualism, and what are the implications of this relationship for our understanding of ecosystems?\n    - A: Yes, it is an example of mutualism, and it highlights the complexity of ecosystems.\n    - B: No, it is not an example of mutualism, and it has no implications for our understanding of ecosystems.\n    - C: Yes, it is an example of mutualism, but it has no implications for our understanding of ecosystems.\n    - D: No, it is not an example of mutualism, but it highlights the complexity of ecosystems.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Is it acceptable to eat figs that may contain the bodies of dead wasps, and what are the ethical implications of this practice?\n    - A: Yes, it is acceptable, and there are no ethical implications.\n    - B: No, it is not acceptable, and there are significant ethical implications.\n    - C: Yes, it is acceptable, but there are some ethical implications.\n    - D: No, it is not acceptable, but there are no ethical implications.\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: This question is subjective and may have different answers based on individual perspectives. The correct answer provided is one possible perspective.)"
