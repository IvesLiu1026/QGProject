    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How do fig wasps typically enter young figs?\n    - A: Through a large opening at the top\n    - B: Through a tiny opening at the bottom\n    - C: By boring holes through the fig's skin\n    - D: They do not enter the fig at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many species of figs exist?\n    - A: Over 100\n    - B: Over 500\n    - C: Over 750\n    - D: Over 1000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the dual role of fig wasps in the pollination process of figs?\n    - A: They only lay eggs inside the fig\n    - B: They only pollinate the fig\n    - C: They lay eggs inside the fig and also pollinate it\n    - D: They have no role in pollination\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is unique about the common fig compared to other species?\n    - A: It requires pollination by fig wasps\n    - B: It does not require pollination in the same way as other species\n    - C: It is the only species of fig that is edible\n    - D: It is the largest species of fig\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why is understanding the unique pollination process of figs important?\n    - A: To improve agricultural practices\n    - B: To appreciate the complexity of ecosystems and the interconnectedness of species\n    - C: To eliminate fig wasps\n    - D: To increase fig consumption\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can recognizing the role of fig wasps in pollination inform agricultural practices?\n    - A: By eliminating the need for pesticides\n    - B: By reducing the need for fertilizers\n    - C: By informing conservation efforts and agricultural practices\n    - D: By increasing crop yields\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What type of relationship exists between figs and fig wasps?\n    - A: Parasitic\n    - B: Mutualistic\n    - C: Commensal\n    - D: Symbiotic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the fig wasp's actions and the pollination of the fig?\n    - A: The fig wasp's actions have no effect on pollination\n    - B: The fig wasp's actions lead to the pollination of the fig\n    - C: The fig wasp's actions prevent pollination\n    - D: The fig wasp's actions delay pollination\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can the unique pollination process of figs be seen in a broader context?\n    - A: As a microcosm of the interconnectedness of species in ecosystems\n    - B: As a unique exception to the rule of pollination\n    - C: As a way to increase crop yields\n    - D: As a way to eliminate pests\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can the domestication of figs be used as an example of?\n    - A: How human activity can harm the natural world\n    - B: How human activity can shape the natural world and lead to new species\n    - C: How human activity has no impact on the natural world\n    - D: How human activity can only benefit the natural world\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Is the relationship between figs and fig wasps an example of mutualism, and what are the implications of this relationship for our understanding of ecosystems?\n    - A: Yes, it is an example of mutualism, and it highlights the complexity of ecosystems\n    - B: No, it is not an example of mutualism, and it has no implications for our understanding of ecosystems\n    - C: Yes, it is an example of mutualism, but it has no implications for our understanding of ecosystems\n    - D: No, it is not an example of mutualism, but it highlights the complexity of ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What are the ethical implications of eating figs that may contain the bodies of dead wasps?\n    - A: There are no ethical implications\n    - B: There are significant ethical implications\n    - C: There are some ethical implications, but they are minimal\n    - D: It is not acceptable to eat figs that may contain dead wasps\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, while ensuring that the correct answers remain accurate. The distractors are still plausible but incorrect, and the questions align with the key concepts in the transcript. No major changes were necessary, and the refined questions are ready for use."
