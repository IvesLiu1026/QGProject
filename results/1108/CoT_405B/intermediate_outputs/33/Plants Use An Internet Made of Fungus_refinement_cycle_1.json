    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What do mycorrhizal fungi provide to plants in exchange for sugars?\n    - A: Water and oxygen\n    - B: Water and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus\n    - C: Carbon dioxide and sunlight\n    - D: Soil and minerals\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of land plants are connected to some kind of mycorrhizal network?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 70%\n    - C: 90%\n    - D: 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) How do plants use the mycorrhizal network to help each other out in times of stress?\n    - A: By competing for resources\n    - B: By sharing nutrients during seasonal changes, such as when one plant is dormant\n    - C: By warning each other of predators\n    - D: By producing more sugars\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What type of interactions can occur between plants through the fungal network?\n    - A: Only cooperative interactions\n    - B: Only competitive interactions\n    - C: Both cooperative and competitive interactions, such as sharing resources and warning each other of danger\n    - D: No interactions at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How could understanding the mycorrhizal network lead to new strategies for agriculture and forestry?\n    - A: By planting species that compete with each other\n    - B: By planting species that share well together to yield better harvests and promote healthier forests\n    - C: By using more fertilizers and pesticides\n    - D: By clear-cutting forests\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What could be a potential application of the mycorrhizal network in promoting healthier forests?\n    - A: Selecting species that work well together and share resources\n    - B: Selecting species that compete with each other\n    - C: Using more machinery in forestry\n    - D: Reducing the number of tree species\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi?\n    - A: Mutually beneficial, with plants providing sugars and fungi providing nutrients\n    - B: One-sided, with plants providing sugars and fungi providing nothing\n    - C: One-sided, with fungi providing nutrients and plants providing nothing\n    - D: Neutral, with no benefits or costs to either party\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can influence the fungal network?\n    - A: Only the health and strength of individual plants\n    - B: Only the type of plant species\n    - C: Only the type of fungal species\n    - D: The health and strength of individual plants, as well as the type of plant and fungal species, and other factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) How could the mycorrhizal network be seen?\n    - A: As a simple system with no interactions\n    - B: As a complex social network, with plants and fungi interacting and influencing each other's behavior\n    - C: As a system with only cooperative interactions\n    - D: As a system with only competitive interactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What could the discovery of the mycorrhizal network lead to?\n    - A: New areas of research in fields such as ecology, biology, and environmental science\n    - B: A reduction in the number of research areas\n    - C: No changes in research areas\n    - D: Only applied research, with no basic research\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a limitation of the comparison between the mycorrhizal network and the internet?\n    - A: It is too complex\n    - B: It is too simple\n    - C: It is not accurate at all\n    - D: It may also be limited in its accuracy, as the mycorrhizal network is a complex biological system\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is a potential concern about manipulating or exploiting the mycorrhizal network for human benefit?\n    - A: It could lead to more efficient use of resources\n    - B: It could lead to new areas of research\n    - C: It raises questions about the ethics of manipulating or exploiting these complex biological systems\n    - D: It is not a concern at all\n[Correct answer]: C"
