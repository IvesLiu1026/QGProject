The cacao seed is fermented, cleaned, roasted, and ground to create cocoa mass.\n3. Cocoa mass is liquefied and separated into cocoa solids and cocoa butter.\n4. The ratio of cocoa solids to other ingredients determines the flavor of chocolate.\n5. Theobromine is a bitter, mild stimulant found in cocoa solids.\n6. Flavanols are compounds found in chocolate linked to heart health.\n7. A review of research found that flavanol-containing chocolate lowered blood pressure in some trials.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The process of creating chocolate involves multiple steps, from harvesting cacao seeds to creating cocoa mass and separating it into solids and butter.\n2. The amount of cocoa solids in chocolate determines its flavor and potential health benefits.\n3. Theobromine has similar effects to caffeine, but is milder.\n4. The review of research on chocolate and blood pressure found a small but statistically significant link between flavanol-containing chocolate and lower blood pressure.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Understanding the process of creating chocolate can help individuals make informed decisions about the type of chocolate they consume.\n2. Knowing the potential health benefits of flavanol-containing chocolate can encourage individuals to incorporate it into their diet.\n3. Critical thinking skills can be applied to evaluate the validity of health claims in the media.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the amount of cocoa solids and the flavor of chocolate.\n2. The comparison between the effects of theobromine and caffeine.\n3. The correlation between flavanol-containing chocolate and lower blood pressure.\n4. The contrast between the findings of the review of research and the media's interpretation of the results.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining knowledge of the chocolate-making process and the potential health benefits of flavanol-containing chocolate to create a new understanding of the importance of choosing high-quality chocolate.\n2. Integrating critical thinking skills with scientific knowledge to evaluate the validity of health claims in the media.\n3. Considering the potential interactions between flavanols and other compounds in chocolate to understand their combined effects on health.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Judging the validity of the review of research on chocolate and blood pressure.\n2. Critiquing the media's interpretation of the results and identifying potential biases.\n3. Evaluating the strength of the evidence supporting the link between flavanol-containing chocolate and lower blood pressure.\n4. Justifying the decision to incorporate flavanol-containing chocolate into one's diet based on the available evidence."
