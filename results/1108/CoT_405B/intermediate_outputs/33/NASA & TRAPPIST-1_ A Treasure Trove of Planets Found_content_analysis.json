Knowledge**:\n- Seven rocky, Earth-sized planets were discovered around a nearby cold, small star.\n- Three of the planets orbit in the habitable zone around the star.\n- The planetary system is called TRAPPIST-1.\n- TRAPPIST-1 was discovered using the Belgian-operated telescope in Chile and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.\n- The planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system are extremely close to one another.\n- NASA's James Webb Telescope will be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of water, methane, and oxygen in potential atmospheres.\n\n**2. Comprehension**:\n- The discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system is significant because it has seven Earth-sized planets that could potentially have liquid water.\n- The habitable zone around a star is the region where liquid water could exist on a planet.\n- The TRAPPIST-1 system is unique because of the close proximity of the planets to one another.\n- The James Webb Telescope will play a crucial role in assessing the habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\n\n**3. Application**:\n- The discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system could have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.\n- The study of the TRAPPIST-1 system could provide insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems.\n- The James Webb Telescope's ability to detect chemical fingerprints of atmospheres could be used to study the atmospheres of other exoplanets.\n\n**4. Analysis**:\n- The relationship between the proximity of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system and their potential habitability.\n- The contrast between the TRAPPIST-1 system and other known planetary systems.\n- The cause-and-effect connection between the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system and the advancement of exoplanetary science.\n\n**5. Synthesis**:\n- Combining the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system with the capabilities of the James Webb Telescope could lead to a new understanding of the conditions necessary for life to exist on other planets.\n- Integrating the study of the TRAPPIST-1 system with the study of other exoplanetary systems could provide a more comprehensive understanding of planetary formation and evolution.\n\n**6. Evaluation**:\n- Assessing the significance of the TRAPPIST-1 discovery in the context of the search for extraterrestrial life.\n- Evaluating the implications of the TRAPPIST-1 system for our understanding of planetary formation and evolution.\n- Justifying the use of resources to study the TRAPPIST-1 system and other exoplanetary systems."
