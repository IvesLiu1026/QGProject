Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was the name of the British steamer that crashed into the French ship \"Frigorifique\" in 1884?\n    - A: \"Mary Celeste\"\n    - B: \"Rumney\"\n    - C: \"A. Ernest Mills\"\n    - D: \"HMS Victory\"\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What principle states that the upward buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced?\n    - A: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\n    - B: Archimedes's Principle\n    - C: Coriolis Effect\n    - D: Bernoulli's Principle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What determines whether an object will float or sink in water?\n    - A: Weight\n    - B: Density\n    - C: Size\n    - D: Shape\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What term is used to describe ships that are found abandoned and adrift at sea?\n    - A: Ghost ships\n    - B: Abandoned vessels\n    - C: Derelict ships\n    - D: Mysterious ships\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) A ship designer wants to build a vessel that can withstand various water conditions. What principle should they apply to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\n    - B: Archimedes's Principle\n    - C: Fluid Dynamics Principle\n    - D: Coriolis Effect\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A navigator wants to track a ship more efficiently. What knowledge should they apply to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Understanding of ocean currents\n    - B: Knowledge of ship design\n    - C: Familiarity with navigation software\n    - D: Understanding of weather patterns\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the density of a ship and its ability to float?\n    - A: A ship's density has no effect on its ability to float.\n    - B: A ship's density is directly proportional to its ability to float.\n    - C: A ship's density is inversely proportional to its ability to float.\n    - D: A ship's density only affects its stability, not its ability to float.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the primary difference between supernatural explanations for ghost ships and scientific explanations?\n    - A: Supernatural explanations focus on natural phenomena, while scientific explanations focus on paranormal activity.\n    - B: Supernatural explanations focus on paranormal activity, while scientific explanations focus on natural phenomena.\n    - C: Supernatural explanations are based on empirical evidence, while scientific explanations are based on speculation.\n    - D: Supernatural explanations are more widely accepted than scientific explanations.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the result of combining knowledge of buoyancy, fluid dynamics, and ocean currents?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of ship design\n    - B: A better understanding of the complex behavior of ships at sea\n    - C: A greater appreciation for supernatural explanations of ghost ships\n    - D: A more comprehensive understanding of navigation software\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the benefit of integrating scientific explanations with historical accounts of ghost ships?\n    - A: It provides a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon\n    - B: It disproves the existence of ghost ships\n    - C: It supports supernatural explanations for ghost ships\n    - D: It has no impact on our understanding of ghost ships\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the validity of supernatural explanations for ghost ships in light of scientific evidence?\n    - A: Supernatural explanations are supported by scientific evidence\n    - B: Supernatural explanations are disproven by scientific evidence\n    - C: Supernatural explanations are unrelated to scientific evidence\n    - D: Supernatural explanations are more plausible than scientific explanations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is it important to understand ocean currents and their patterns in navigation and ship tracking?\n    - A: It allows for more efficient navigation\n    - B: It provides a better understanding of ship design\n    - C: It supports supernatural explanations for ghost ships\n    - D: It has no impact on navigation and ship tracking\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
