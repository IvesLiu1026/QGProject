    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated minimum time jellyfish have inhabited the ocean?\n    - A: 100 million years\n    - B: 500 million years\n    - C: 1 billion years\n    - D: 2 billion years\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary component of the mesoglea in jellyfish?\n    - A: Protein fibers\n    - B: Water\n    - C: Carbohydrates\n    - D: Fats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the sting in jellyfish?\n    - A: To capture prey and defend themselves\n    - B: To communicate with other jellyfish\n    - C: To navigate through the ocean\n    - D: To regulate their body temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the unique survival strategy of the immortal jellyfish?\n    - A: It can change its cells' identity when it's sick, aging, or under stress\n    - B: It can produce a large number of offspring\n    - C: It can live in extreme ocean conditions\n    - D: It can photosynthesize\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a potential application of studying the venom of jellyfish?\n    - A: Developing new medicines or treatments\n    - B: Creating new materials for construction\n    - C: Improving navigation systems\n    - D: Enhancing computer algorithms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can understanding the anatomy and behavior of jellyfish help scientists?\n    - A: Develop new tools and techniques for studying biological processes\n    - B: Improve their understanding of the ocean's currents\n    - C: Enhance their knowledge of marine ecosystems\n    - D: Develop new methods for fishing\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the jellyfish's simple anatomy and its remarkable abilities?\n    - A: Its simple anatomy limits its abilities\n    - B: Its simple anatomy allows for more efficient use of energy\n    - C: Its simple anatomy is compensated by its complex behavior\n    - D: Its simple anatomy is unrelated to its abilities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a key difference between the venom of different jellyfish species?\n    - A: The venom of all jellyfish species is equally potent\n    - B: The venom of some jellyfish species is more potent than others\n    - C: The venom of all jellyfish species is harmless to humans\n    - D: The venom of some jellyfish species is only effective against certain prey\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can combining the knowledge of jellyfish anatomy and behavior with the use of GFP in scientific research be useful?\n    - A: It can help develop new tools and techniques for studying biological processes\n    - B: It can improve our understanding of the ocean's currents\n    - C: It can enhance our knowledge of marine ecosystems\n    - D: It can develop new methods for fishing\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is a potential outcome of integrating the study of jellyfish venom with the development of new medicines or treatments?\n    - A: The development of new medicines or treatments for diseases\n    - B: The creation of new materials for construction\n    - C: The improvement of navigation systems\n    - D: The enhancement of computer algorithms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a key consideration when assessing the impact of jellyfish on marine ecosystems?\n    - A: Their role in the ocean's food chain\n    - B: Their ability to bioluminesce\n    - C: Their venom's potency\n    - D: Their size and shape\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a key factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of using GFP in scientific research?\n    - A: Its potential applications in medicine and biology\n    - B: Its ability to mark genetic modifications or reveal critical molecules\n    - C: Its cost and availability\n    - D: Its potential risks and limitations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made some minor adjustments to ensure clarity and conciseness. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
