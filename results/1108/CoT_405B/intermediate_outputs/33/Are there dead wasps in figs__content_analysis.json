    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n- Figs contain the bodies of dead wasps in many species.\n- Figs are packages that contain all of the fig tree's flowers within them.\n- Fig wasps are attracted to young figs through a tiny opening at the bottom.\n- Fig wasps lose their wings and antennae when entering the fig.\n- Female wasps lay eggs in the fig's female flowers.\n- Male wasps mature first, fertilize female wasps, and then die inside the fig.\n- Female wasps pick up pollen from the fig and leave through holes made by the males.\n- There are over 750 species of figs.\n- Humans have been domesticating figs for over 11,000 years.\n- The common fig is a species that humans have had a huge hand in creating.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n- Figs are not typical fruits and have a unique pollination process involving fig wasps.\n- Fig wasps are essential for pollinating figs, but they also lay eggs inside the fig.\n- The fig provides a home for the wasp's babies, and the wasp pollinates the fig in return.\n- The common fig has been domesticated and does not require pollination in the same way as other species.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n- Understanding the unique pollination process of figs can help us appreciate the complexity of ecosystems and the interconnectedness of species.\n- Recognizing the role of fig wasps in pollination can inform agricultural practices and conservation efforts.\n- Considering the domestication of figs can lead to discussions about the impact of human activity on the natural world.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n- The relationship between figs and fig wasps is an example of mutualism, where both species benefit from each other.\n- The contrast between the common fig and other species highlights the impact of human domestication on the natural world.\n- The cause-and-effect connection between the fig wasp's actions and the pollination of the fig demonstrates the complexity of ecosystems.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n- The unique pollination process of figs can be seen as a microcosm of the interconnectedness of species in ecosystems.\n- The domestication of figs can be used as an example of how human activity can shape the natural world and lead to new species.\n- The relationship between figs and fig wasps can be used to explore the concept of mutualism and its importance in ecosystems.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n- Is the relationship between figs and fig wasps an example of mutualism, and what are the implications of this relationship for our understanding of ecosystems?\n- How does the domestication of figs reflect human values and priorities, and what are the consequences of this domestication for the natural world?\n- Is it acceptable to eat figs that may contain the bodies of dead wasps, and what are the ethical implications of this practice?"
