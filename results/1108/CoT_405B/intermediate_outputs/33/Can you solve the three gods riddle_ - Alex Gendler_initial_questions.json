B: The relationship between the questions asked and the answers provided by Arr\n    - C: The relationship between the logical structure of the questions and the answers provided by Tee and Eff\n    - D: The relationship between the number of questions asked and the solution to the puzzle\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the main difference in strategy required to identify each alien?\n    - A: The use of hypothetical conditions in questions for Tee and Eff, and the use of direct questions for Arr\n    - B: The use of logical reasoning for Tee and Eff, and the use of intuition for Arr\n    - C: The contrast between the predictable answers of Tee and Eff and the random answers of Arr\n    - D: The use of different questioning techniques for each alien\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What is the creative solution to the puzzle that combines different ideas?\n    - A: Using hypothetical conditions in questions and including the words 'ozo' and 'ulu' in the questions\n    - B: Using process of elimination to identify the aliens and including the words 'ozo' and 'ulu' in the questions\n    -
