    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge**:\n\n1. The average human body is composed of 55-60% water.\n2. Human babies are 75% water at birth, which decreases to 65% by their first birthday.\n3. Water in the body cushions and lubricates joints, regulates temperature, and nourishes the brain and spinal cord.\n4. An adult's brain and heart are approximately 75% water, lungs are 83% water, and bones are 31% water.\n5. The body loses 2-3 liters of water daily through sweat, urine, bowel movements, and breathing.\n6. The recommended daily water intake is 2.5-3.7 liters for men and 2-2.7 liters for women.\n7. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and broccoli are over 90% water.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. Water plays a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions, including regulating temperature and nourishing the brain and spinal cord.\n2. Dehydration can cause drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as cognitive impairment.\n3. Over-hydration (hyponatremia) can cause sodium electrolytes to become diluted, leading to cell swelling and potentially life-threatening complications.\n4. Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration and over-hydration.\n5. Drinking enough water can have long-term benefits, such as lowering the risk of stroke, managing diabetes, and reducing the risk of certain cancers.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. Athletes need to be mindful of their water intake to avoid over-hydration, especially in extreme physical conditions.\n2. Individuals with access to clean drinking water can easily manage their hydration levels on a day-to-day basis.\n3. People can supplement their liquid intake with water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables.\n4. Drinking enough water can improve overall health and well-being, particularly in individuals with diabetes or at risk of stroke.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between water composition and age, with babies having a higher water composition than adults.\n2. The contrast between dehydration and over-hydration, including their causes and effects on the body.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between drinking enough water and maintaining proper bodily functions.\n4. The relationship between water intake and environmental factors, such as temperature and physical activity.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining the importance of water intake with the concept of individual variability (e.g., age, sex, weight) to create personalized hydration plans.\n2. Integrating the benefits of drinking water with the benefits of consuming water-rich foods to create a comprehensive hydration strategy.\n3. Considering the long-term benefits of optimal hydration in relation to overall health and well-being.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. Critiquing the conventional wisdom of drinking eight glasses of water a day and evaluating the validity of current hydration recommendations.\n2. Justifying the importance of proper hydration in relation to athletic performance and overall health.\n3. Evaluating the effectiveness of drinking water in reducing the risk of certain diseases, such as stroke and diabetes.\n4. Assessing the impact of access to clean drinking water on hydration levels and overall health."
