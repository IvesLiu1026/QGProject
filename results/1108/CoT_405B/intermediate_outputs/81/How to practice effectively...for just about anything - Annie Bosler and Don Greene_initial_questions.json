    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the provided content analysis:\n\n**Knowledge**:\n\n1) What are the two types of neural tissue found in the brain?\n    - A: Grey matter and neurons\n    - B: White matter and synapses\n    - C: Grey matter and white matter\n    - D: Axons and dendrites\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What substance acts as insulation for electrical signals in axons?\n    - A: Myelin\n    - B: Synovial fluid\n    - C: Cerebrospinal fluid\n    - D: Grey matter\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1) What is the primary goal of practice in improving physical skills?\n    - A: To increase muscle mass\n    - B: To enhance cardiovascular endurance\n    - C: To improve ease, speed, and confidence in performing physical skills\n    - D: To reduce the risk of injury\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the role of myelin in neural pathways?\n    - A: To generate electrical signals\n    - B: To transmit information from the brain to muscles\n    - C: To act as insulation, preventing energy loss from electrical signals\n    - D: To produce neurotransmitters\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**:\n\n1) A musician wants to improve their piano skills. What practice habit can they adopt to optimize their practice sessions?\n    - A: Practicing for long periods without breaks\n    - B: Focusing on the task, minimizing distractions, starting slowly, and taking breaks\n    - C: Playing complex pieces from the beginning\n    - D: Practicing only once a week\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) An athlete wants to reinforce their learning and improvement in a specific sport. What technique can they use in addition to physical practice?\n    - A: Vividly imagining physical motions\n    - B: Watching videos of professional athletes\n    - C: Reading books on sports psychology\n    - D: Joining a sports team\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1) What is the relationship between practice and the development of myelin sheath around axons?\n    - A: Practice decreases the layers of myelin sheath around axons\n    - B: Practice has no effect on the development of myelin sheath around axons\n    - C: Practice increases the layers of myelin sheath around axons, leading to faster and more efficient neural pathways\n    - D: Practice damages the myelin sheath around axons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the actual role of myelination in neural pathways, contrary to the idea of \"muscle memory\"?\n    - A: Myelination stores memories in muscles\n    - B: Myelination transmits information from the brain to muscles\n    - C: Myelination acts as insulation, preventing energy loss from electrical signals and moving them efficiently along neural pathways\n    - D: Myelination generates electrical signals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1) How can an individual develop a personalized approach to improving their physical skills?\n    - A: By combining the concepts of myelination and effective practice\n    - B: By focusing only on physical practice\n    - C: By ignoring the role of myelination in neural pathways\n    - D: By adopting a generic practice routine\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be integrated with physical practice to enhance learning and improvement?\n    - A: Mental practice\n    - B: Watching videos of professional athletes\n    - C: Reading books on sports psychology\n    - D: Joining a sports team\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1) What is more important in practice, rather than just focusing on the quantity of practice hours?\n    - A: The number of practice sessions per week\n    - B: The quality and effectiveness of practice\n    - C: The duration of each practice session\n    - D: The type of equipment used\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What should be considered when assessing the validity of theories attempting to quantify the number of hours, days, or years required to master a skill?\n    - A: Only the number of practice hours\n    - B: Only the quality of practice\n    - C: Both the quality and quantity of practice\n    - D: Neither the quality nor quantity of practice\n[Correct answer]: C"
