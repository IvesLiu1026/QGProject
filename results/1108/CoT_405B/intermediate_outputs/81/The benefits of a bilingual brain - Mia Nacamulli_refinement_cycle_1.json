    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two active parts of language ability?\n    - A: Speaking and listening\n    - B: Speaking and writing\n    - C: Reading and writing\n    - D: Listening and reading\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) According to the critical period hypothesis, what is the main reason children learn languages more easily?\n    - A: They have more time to practice\n    - B: They have a higher IQ\n    - C: The plasticity of their developing brains allows them to use both hemispheres for language acquisition\n    - D: They are more motivated\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n3) What is the main difference between compound and coordinate bilinguals?\n    - A: Compound bilinguals learn two languages simultaneously, while coordinate bilinguals learn them sequentially\n    - B: Compound bilinguals learn two languages sequentially, while coordinate bilinguals learn them simultaneously\n    - C: Compound bilinguals use a single set of concepts for both languages, while coordinate bilinguals use separate sets of concepts\n    - D: Compound bilinguals are more proficient in one language, while coordinate bilinguals are more proficient in the other\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n4) What is lateralization in the context of language acquisition?\n    - A: The process of learning a new language\n    - B: The development of language skills in one hemisphere of the brain\n    - C: The ability to switch between two languages\n    - D: The use of both hemispheres of the brain for language processing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) This question was removed as it was not directly related to the transcript.\n\n6) A teacher who wants to encourage bilingualism in the classroom should:\n    - A: Use only one language for instruction\n    - B: Encourage students to use only their native language\n    - C: Provide opportunities for students to practice both languages\n    - D: Use translation software to help students understand the material\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the main difference in language processing between children and adults?\n    - A: Children process language more quickly than adults\n    - B: Adults process language more accurately than children\n    - C: Children use both hemispheres of the brain for language processing, while adults typically use one hemisphere\n    - D: Children have a more limited vocabulary than adults\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n8) What is the relationship between language acquisition and brain development?\n    - A: Language acquisition is independent of brain development\n    - B: Language acquisition is dependent on brain development, but only up to a certain age\n    - C: Language acquisition is closely tied to brain development, and changes in the brain can affect language ability\n    - D: Language acquisition is only possible in children because their brains are more plastic\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How can the concepts of bilingualism and lateralization be combined to understand individual differences in language acquisition?\n    - A: By recognizing that bilinguals use both hemispheres of the brain for language processing\n    - B: By understanding that lateralization affects language acquisition in bilinguals and monolinguals equally\n    - C: By acknowledging that individual differences in language acquisition are due to differences in brain structure\n    - D: By considering how the development of language skills in one hemisphere of the brain affects language ability in bilinguals\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What new perspective can be created by merging the ideas of language acquisition and executive function?\n    - A: Language acquisition is only possible through explicit instruction\n    - B: Executive function is not important for language acquisition\n    - C: Language acquisition can be improved by training executive function skills\n    - D: Language acquisition is independent of executive function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) This question was removed as it was not directly related to the transcript.\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of language learning strategies for bilinguals and multilinguals be evaluated?\n    - A: By comparing the language proficiency of bilinguals and monolinguals\n    - B: By assessing the cognitive benefits of bilingualism\n    - C: By examining the relationship between language acquisition and brain development\n    - D: By measuring the improvement in language skills over time using a variety of assessments\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional questions were not added as the existing questions cover the key concepts in the transcript."
