    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Approximately how many concussions occur in the United States each year?\n    - A: Between 1 and 2 million\n    - B: Between 2.5 and 4 million\n    - C: Between 5 and 6 million\n    - D: More than 10 million\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the consistency of the brain's tissue?\n    - A: Like rubber\n    - B: Like jello\n    - C: Like concrete\n    - D: Like muscle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is the brain vulnerable to damage from sudden jolts or impacts?\n    - A: Because of its rigid composition\n    - B: Because of its delicate structure and non-uniform tissue\n    - C: Because of its ability to absorb shocks\n    - D: Because of its hard outer layer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is essential for the brain to heal itself after a concussion?\n    - A: Immediate return to activity\n    - B: Rest and gradual return to activity\n    - C: Medication and surgery\n    - D: Isolation and confinement\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding the risks and consequences of concussions inform?\n    - A: Treatment options for patients\n    - B: Safety protocols and guidelines for sports and recreational activities\n    - C: Research methods for studying brain diseases\n    - D: Public awareness campaigns for concussion prevention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can educating athletes, coaches, and parents about concussions promote safer playing practices?\n    - A: By increasing aggression and competitiveness\n    - B: By reducing fear and anxiety\n    - C: By promoting awareness and caution\n    - D: By ignoring safety protocols\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between repeated subconcussive hits and the development of degenerative brain diseases?\n    - A: There is no connection between the two\n    - B: Repeated subconcussive hits can lead to a reduced risk of degenerative brain diseases\n    - C: Repeated subconcussive hits can lead to an increased risk of degenerative brain diseases\n    - D: The relationship is still unknown\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the role of tau proteins in the development of CTE?\n    - A: They help to prevent the development of CTE\n    - B: They have no impact on the development of CTE\n    - C: They can dislodge and clump together, contributing to the development of CTE\n    - D: They are only present in individuals with CTE\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can knowledge of concussions and subconcussive hits be combined to improve athlete safety?\n    - A: By developing new diagnostic tools and treatments\n    - B: By creating new safety protocols and guidelines for sports and recreational activities\n    - C: By increasing funding for research on brain diseases\n    - D: By reducing the number of athletes participating in contact sports\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be integrated with research on the effects of subconcussive hits to improve diagnosis and treatment of degenerative brain diseases?\n    - A: Research on the effects of concussions\n    - B: Development of new diagnostic tools and treatments\n    - C: Public awareness campaigns for concussion prevention\n    - D: Treatment options for patients\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What should be assessed when evaluating the effectiveness of current safety protocols and guidelines for preventing concussions and subconcussive hits?\n    - A: The number of athletes participating in contact sports\n    - B: The frequency and severity of concussions and subconcussive hits\n    - C: The cost of implementing safety protocols and guidelines\n    - D: The level of public awareness about concussion prevention\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a justification for further research on the effects of concussions and subconcussive hits on brain health?\n    - A: The current understanding of concussions and subconcussive hits is comprehensive and complete\n    - B: The impact of concussions and subconcussive hits on brain health is minimal\n    - C: There is a need to better understand the long-term consequences of concussions and subconcussive hits\n    - D: Research on brain diseases is too expensive and time-consuming\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI have made minor adjustments to questions 3, 9, and 10 to improve clarity and concision. The remaining questions did not require significant refinement."
