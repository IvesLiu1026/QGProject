    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the three types of simple sugars mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Glucose, maltose, and sucrose\n    - B: Glucose, fructose, and galactose\n    - C: Lactose, maltose, and starch\n    - D: Fiber, glucose, and fructose\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which two polysaccharides, derived from plants, have different effects on the body due to their distinct molecular bonds?\n    - A: Starch and lactose\n    - B: Fiber and maltose\n    - C: Starch and fiber\n    - D: Sucrose and glucose\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What happens to complex carbohydrates during digestion?\n    - A: They are broken down into proteins\n    - B: They are converted into fats\n    - C: They are broken down into their monosaccharide building blocks, which can be used by cells for energy\n    - D: They are eliminated from the body\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is a potential consequence of chronically consuming high amounts of carbohydrates?\n    - A: Increased insulin sensitivity\n    - B: Decreased risk of metabolic syndrome\n    - C: Increased risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome\n    - D: No significant effect on the body\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding the glycemic index help individuals manage their diet?\n    - A: By encouraging them to consume more starch-rich foods\n    - B: By helping them make informed food choices to manage their blood sugar levels\n    - C: By promoting a diet high in fiber and low in starch\n    - D: By reducing their risk of developing cardiovascular disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What can recognizing the importance of fiber in slowing down glucose release encourage individuals to do?\n    - A: Incorporate more starch-rich foods into their diet\n    - B: Reduce their consumption of fiber-rich foods\n    - C: Incorporate more fiber-rich foods into their diet\n    - D: Adopt a diet low in carbohydrates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between carbohydrate consumption and insulin resistance?\n    - A: Consuming high amounts of carbohydrates increases insulin sensitivity\n    - B: Consuming high amounts of carbohydrates has no effect on insulin resistance\n    - C: Consuming high amounts of carbohydrates may lead to insulin resistance\n    - D: Consuming low amounts of carbohydrates increases insulin resistance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How do the effects of starch and fiber on blood sugar levels differ?\n    - A: Starch and fiber have the same effect on blood sugar levels\n    - B: Starch is digested slowly, while fiber is digested quickly\n    - C: Starch is digested quickly, while fiber slows down glucose release\n    - D: Starch and fiber have no effect on blood sugar levels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can combining knowledge of carbohydrate types and their effects on blood sugar levels lead to?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of how to manage blood sugar levels through dietary choices\n    - B: A better understanding of the importance of insulin sensitivity\n    - C: A reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome\n    - D: An increased risk of insulin resistance\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the importance of maintaining healthy insulin levels?\n    - A: To reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease\n    - B: To increase insulin sensitivity\n    - C: To manage blood sugar levels and prevent insulin resistance\n    - D: To promote a diet high in starch\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What can evaluating the scientific evidence supporting the link between carbohydrate consumption and insulin resistance help individuals do?\n    - A: Make informed decisions about their diet\n    - B: Reduce their risk of developing metabolic syndrome\n    - C: Increase their consumption of starch-rich foods\n    - D: Decrease their insulin sensitivity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What can assessing the credibility of sources providing information on the glycemic index and its application in real-world scenarios help individuals do?\n    - A: Make informed food choices\n    - B: Reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease\n    - C: Increase their consumption of fiber-rich foods\n    - D: Adopt a diet low in carbohydrates\n[Correct answer]: A"
