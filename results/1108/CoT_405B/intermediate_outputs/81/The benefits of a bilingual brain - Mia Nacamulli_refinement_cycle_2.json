    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two active parts of language ability?\n    - A: Speaking and listening\n    - B: Speaking and writing\n    - C: Reading and writing\n    - D: Listening and reading\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the critical period hypothesis, what is the main reason children learn languages more easily?\n    - A: They have more time to practice\n    - B: They have a higher IQ\n    - C: The plasticity of their developing brains allows them to use both hemispheres for language acquisition\n    - D: They are more motivated\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the main difference between compound and coordinate bilinguals?\n    - A: Compound bilinguals learn two languages simultaneously, while coordinate bilinguals learn them sequentially\n    - B: Compound bilinguals learn two languages sequentially, while coordinate bilinguals learn them simultaneously\n    - C: Compound bilinguals use a single set of concepts for both languages, while coordinate bilinguals use separate sets of concepts\n    - D: Compound bilinguals are more proficient in one language, while coordinate bilinguals are more proficient in the other\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is lateralization in the context of language acquisition?\n    - A: The process of learning a new language\n    - B: The development of language skills in one hemisphere of the brain\n    - C: The ability to switch between two languages\n    - D: The use of both hemispheres of the brain for language processing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What cognitive benefits can bilingualism provide?\n    - A: Improved memory and attention\n    - B: Enhanced problem-solving skills and delayed onset of diseases like Alzheimer's\n    - C: Increased IQ and better language skills\n    - D: Better emotional regulation and social skills\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A teacher who wants to encourage bilingualism in the classroom should:\n    - A: Use only one language for instruction\n    - B: Encourage students to use only their native language\n    - C: Provide opportunities for students to practice both languages\n    - D: Use translation software to help students understand the material\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the main difference in language processing between children and adults?\n    - A: Children process language more quickly than adults\n    - B: Adults process language more accurately than children\n    - C: Children use both hemispheres of the brain for language processing, while adults typically use one hemisphere\n    - D: Children have a more limited vocabulary than adults\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between language acquisition and brain development?\n    - A: Language acquisition is independent of brain development\n    - B: Language acquisition is dependent on brain development, but only up to a certain age\n    - C: Language acquisition is closely tied to brain development, and changes in the brain can affect language ability\n    - D: Language acquisition is only possible in children because their brains are more plastic\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can the concepts of bilingualism and lateralization be combined to understand individual differences in language acquisition?\n    - A: By recognizing that bilinguals use both hemispheres of the brain for language processing\n    - B: By understanding that lateralization affects language acquisition in bilinguals and monolinguals equally\n    - C: By acknowledging that individual differences in language acquisition are due to differences in brain structure\n    - D: By considering how the development of language skills in one hemisphere of the brain affects language ability in bilinguals\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What new perspective can be created by merging the ideas of language acquisition and executive function?\n    - A: Language acquisition is only possible through explicit instruction\n    - B: Executive function is not important for language acquisition\n    - C: Language acquisition can be improved by training executive function skills\n    - D: Language acquisition is independent of executive function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in bilingual language processing?\n    - A: It is responsible for language production\n    - B: It is involved in language comprehension\n    - C: It plays a role in executive function, problem-solving, and switching between tasks\n    - D: It is not involved in language processing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of language learning strategies for bilinguals and multilinguals be evaluated?\n    - A: By comparing the language proficiency of bilinguals and monolinguals\n    - B: By assessing the cognitive benefits of bilingualism\n    - C: By examining the relationship between language acquisition and brain development\n    - D: By measuring the improvement in language skills over time using a variety of assessments\n[Correct answer]: D"
