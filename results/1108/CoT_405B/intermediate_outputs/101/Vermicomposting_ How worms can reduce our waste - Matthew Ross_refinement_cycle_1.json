D: Traditional waste management focuses on reducing waste, while vermicomposting focuses on increasing waste\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can vermicomposting be combined with other sustainable practices to create a comprehensive waste reduction strategy?\n    - A: By integrating vermicomposting with recycling programs\n    - B: By combining vermicomposting with composting and anaerobic digestion\n    - C: By using vermicomposting to produce energy\n    - D: By applying vermicomposting principles to reduce water waste\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential product or service that can be developed using vermicomposting principles?\n    - A: Worm-based animal feed\n    - B: Natural fertilizers for urban gardens\n    - C: Composting bins for households\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a justification for using vermicomposting as a viable solution to reduce food waste and promote sustainability?\n    - A: Vermicomposting is a cost-effective method of waste management\n    - B: Vermicomposting reduces greenhouse gas emissions and promotes sustainable agriculture\n    - C: Vermicomposting is a quick and easy way to produce natural fertilizers\n    - D: Vermicomposting is a proven method of reducing waste in large-scale industrial settings\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential critique of traditional waste management practices?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    -
