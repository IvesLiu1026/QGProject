Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a hybrid image composed of?\n    - A: A combination of two high spatial frequency images\n    - B: A combination of a low spatial frequency of one picture with a high spatial frequency of another\n    - C: A combination of two low spatial frequency images\n    - D: A single image with varying spatial frequencies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which two images are used in the hybrid image example?\n    - A: Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci\n    - B: Marilyn Monroe and Pablo Picasso\n    - C: Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe\n    - D: Charles Darwin and Vincent van Gogh\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the purpose of the hybrid image in demonstrating eyesight and perception?\n    - A: To show how people with perfect eyesight can see two images at once\n    - B: To demonstrate how eyesight affects perception, with people with decent eyesight seeing one image and those with poor eyesight seeing another\n    - C: To illustrate how distance affects image perception\n    - D: To prove that eyesight has no impact on perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the hybrid image as the distance from the screen increases or decreases?\n    - A: The image remains the same\n    - B: The image changes due to the way our eyes process details\n    - C: The image becomes distorted\n    - D: The image disappears\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can the concept of hybrid images be applied in graphic design?\n    - A: By creating images that are only visible from a certain distance\n    - B: By creating images that change or reveal different details at different distances\n    - C: By creating images that adapt to different screen sizes\n    - D: By creating images that remain the same regardless of distance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential use of hybrid images in advertising?\n    - A: To create ads that are only visible to people with perfect eyesight\n    - B: To create ads that are only visible to people with poor eyesight\n    - C: To create ads that change or reveal different details at different distances\n    - D: To create ads that use color to grab attention\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the key relationship demonstrated by the hybrid image effect?\n    - A: The relationship between eyesight and hearing\n    - B: The relationship between distance and image size\n    - C: The relationship between the distance from the screen and the perceived image\n    - D: The relationship between spatial frequency and image color\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What creates the illusion of two different images in the hybrid image?\n    - A: The contrast between the low spatial frequency and high spatial frequency images\n    - B: The similarity between the low spatial frequency and high spatial frequency images\n    - C: The use of different colors in the images\n    - D: The use of different shapes in the images\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How can the concept of hybrid images be combined with other optical illusions?\n    - A: By creating new and complex visual tricks that play on multiple aspects of perception\n    - B: By creating images that are only visible to people with perfect eyesight\n    - C: By creating images that use color to create a 3D effect\n    - D: By creating images that remain the same regardless of distance\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is a potential application of the concept of hybrid images in exploring perception and reality?\n    - A: Understanding how our brains process and interpret sensory information\n    - B: Understanding how eyesight affects hearing\n    - C: Understanding how distance affects image size\n    - D: Understanding how spatial frequency affects image recognition\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential critique of using hybrid images in advertising?\n    - A: That they are too effective at manipulating viewers\n    - B: That they are not effective at manipulating viewers\n    - C: That they can be misleading or deceptive to viewers\n    - D: That they are too expensive to produce in print\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can the use of hybrid images be justified as a tool for understanding human perception and cognition?\n    - A: By demonstrating their effectiveness in manipulating viewers\n    - B: By showing their potential for creating new and complex visual tricks\n    - C: By highlighting their ability to reveal the relationship between eyesight and perception\n    - D: By illustrating their potential for creating images that adapt to different screen sizes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
