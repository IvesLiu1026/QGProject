    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of a red lump and itch after a mosquito bite?\n    - A: The mosquito's saliva\n    - B: The immune system's response\n    - C: The mosquito's venom\n    - D: The mosquito's bite itself\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where do millions of white blood cells (leukocytes) originate?\n    - A: The liver\n    - B: The bone marrow\n    - C: The spleen\n    - D: The lymph nodes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What triggers the immune response?\n    - A: The presence of white blood cells\n    - B: The detection of antigens on the surface of pathogens\n    - C: The production of antibodies\n    - D: The activation of phagocytes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary function of phagocytes in the immune response?\n    - A: To produce antibodies\n    - B: To activate lymphocytes\n    - C: To destroy foreign cells by consuming them\n    - D: To recognize and respond to familiar antigens\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the primary function of the immune system?\n    - A: To produce antibodies\n    - B: To activate phagocytes\n    - C: To defend against infection, illness, and disease\n    - D: To recognize and respond to familiar antigens\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Why is it that some diseases, such as chickenpox, typically only affect us once?\n    - A: Because the immune system is unable to respond effectively\n    - B: Because the immune system develops long-term immunity\n    - C: Because the disease is highly contagious\n    - D: Because the disease is caused by a virus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the importance of recognizing the symptoms of an immune response?\n    - A: It helps us identify when our body is fighting off an infection\n    - B: It helps us develop long-term immunity\n    - C: It helps us produce antibodies\n    - D: It helps us activate phagocytes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the relationship between antigens and antibodies in the immune response?\n    - A: Each antigen has multiple matching antibodies\n    - B: Each antibody has multiple matching antigens\n    - C: Each antigen has a unique matching antibody\n    - D: There is no relationship between antigens and antibodies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a characteristic of autoimmune diseases?\n    - A: The immune system fails to respond to pathogens\n    - B: The immune system attacks the body's own healthy cells\n    - C: The immune system produces excessive antibodies\n    - D: The immune system fails to develop long-term immunity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the significance of the immune system's ability to adapt to different threats?\n    - A: It allows the immune system to respond to a wide range of pathogens\n    - B: It enables the immune system to develop long-term immunity\n    - C: It helps the immune system to produce antibodies\n    - D: It activates phagocytes to destroy foreign cells\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11-14 as they seemed to be more focused on the application of the knowledge rather than the understanding of the immune system itself. I also refined some of the questions to make them more specific and clear. Let me know if you need any further refinement!"
