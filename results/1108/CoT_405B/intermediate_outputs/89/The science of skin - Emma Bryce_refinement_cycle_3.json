    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of a person's physical weight is comprised of their skin?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 15%\n    - C: 16%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What are the three primary layers that make up the skin?\n    - A: Epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis\n    - B: Dermis, hypodermis, and subcutaneous tissue\n    - C: Epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue\n    - D: Hypodermis, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What are the three primary roles played by the skin in our lives?\n    - A: Protection, respiration, and digestion\n    - B: Sensation, movement, and circulation\n    - C: Protection, regulation, and sensation\n    - D: Respiration, digestion, and circulation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What role does the skin play in the body's defense against external elements?\n    - A: Second line of defense\n    - B: First line of defense\n    - C: Last line of defense\n    - D: No role in defense\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does the skin help regulate body temperature?\n    - A: By releasing heat through the bloodstream alone\n    - B: By conserving heat through the bloodstream alone\n    - C: By releasing heat through sweat and dilating blood vessels, and conserving heat through constricting blood vessels\n    - D: By conserving heat through sweat and constricting blood vessels\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What sensory capabilities does the skin possess?\n    - A: The ability to perceive visual stimuli\n    - B: The ability to perceive auditory stimuli\n    - C: The ability to perceive tactile stimuli\n    - D: The ability to perceive olfactory stimuli\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the skin's structure and its functions?\n    - A: The skin's structure is unrelated to its functions\n    - B: The skin's structure is directly related to its functions\n    - C: The skin's structure is inversely related to its functions\n    - D: The skin's structure is partially related to its functions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the skin's immune defense system interact with microorganisms on the skin?\n    - A: The skin's immune defense system eliminates all microorganisms\n    - B: The skin's immune defense system has no effect on microorganisms\n    - C: The skin's immune defense system helps regulate the presence of microorganisms\n    - D: The skin's immune defense system is weakened by microorganisms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What does the skin's multifunctional nature reflect?\n    - A: Its importance in maintaining overall health and well-being\n    - B: Its role in regulating body temperature\n    - C: Its sensory capabilities\n    - D: Its protective function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is the function of Merkel cells in the skin?\n    - A: To detect and respond to invading microorganisms\n    - B: To regulate body temperature\n    - C: To provide sensation and detect physical stimuli\n    - D: To produce sweat\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How do Langerhans cells contribute to the skin's immune defense?\n    - A: By producing antibodies to fight infections\n    - B: By detecting and communicating the presence of invading microorganisms to resident immune system T-cells\n    - C: By activating the complement system to eliminate pathogens\n    - D: By producing pro-inflammatory cytokines to recruit immune cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the role of sebum in the skin's ecosystem?\n    - A: To provide moisture and hydration to the skin\n    - B: To regulate body temperature\n    - C: To support the growth and maintenance of beneficial microorganisms\n    - D: To produce antibodies to fight infections\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 12-14 as they were not directly related to the transcript, and question 15 was renumbered to 10. I also removed question 16 as it was a duplicate of question 11. Question 17 was renumbered to 12. \n\nNo more refinement needed for the remaining questions."
