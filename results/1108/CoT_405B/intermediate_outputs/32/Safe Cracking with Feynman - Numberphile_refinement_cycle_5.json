    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was Richard Feynman's occupation during World War II?\n    - A: Engineer in the US Army\n    - B: Mathematician in the US Navy\n    - C: Chemist in a private laboratory\n    - D: Theoretical physicist in Los Alamos\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What was the mechanical tolerance of the safes in Los Alamos?\n    - A: Plus or minus 1 on every single number\n    - B: Plus or minus 3 on every single number\n    - C: Plus or minus 5 on every single number\n    - D: Plus or minus 2 on every single number\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What factors contributed to Feynman's ability to develop a method for cracking safes?\n    - A: Technical skills alone\n    - B: Understanding of human behavior alone\n    - C: Combination of technical skills, understanding of human behavior, and mechanical tolerance of the safes\n    - D: Luck and chance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What was the result of Feynman's method of trying every fifth combination to account for the mechanical tolerance?\n    - A: The number of possible combinations increased\n    - B: The number of possible combinations remained the same\n    - C: The number of possible combinations decreased to 1,000\n    - D: The number of possible combinations decreased to 8,000\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What common mistake did people make when setting their safe combinations?\n    - A: Using random numbers\n    - B: Using significant dates\n    - C: Using alphabetical order\n    - D: Using a single number repeatedly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How did Feynman's understanding of human behavior contribute to his ability to crack safes?\n    - A: He used it to guess the combinations directly\n    - B: He used it to narrow down the possible combinations\n    - C: He used it to create a new combination\n    - D: He didn't use it at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What was the effect of Feynman's discovery of the mechanical tolerance on the number of possible combinations?\n    - A: Increased the number of possible combinations\n    - B: Had no effect on the number of possible combinations\n    - C: Changed the type of combinations used\n    - D: Decreased the number of possible combinations\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What can be seen as a form of \"social engineering\" that allowed Feynman to crack safes?\n    - A: Technical skills alone\n    - B: Understanding of human behavior alone\n    - C: Combination of technical skills and understanding of human behavior\n    - D: Mechanical tolerance of the safes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can the security measures in place at Los Alamos be evaluated, given Feynman's ability to crack the safes?\n    - A: Adequate and effective\n    - B: Neutral and average\n    - C: Unknown and unclear\n    - D: Inadequate and ineffective\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What key takeaway from Feynman's story can be applied to various fields?\n    - A: Importance of using strong passwords\n    - B: Importance of using encryption\n    - C: Importance of using firewalls\n    - D: Importance of considering human factors in security\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo more refinement needed."
