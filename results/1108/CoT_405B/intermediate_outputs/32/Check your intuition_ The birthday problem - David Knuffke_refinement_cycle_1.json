    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In a group of 23 people, what is the probability that at least two people will share the same birthday?\n    - A: 25%\n    - B: 40%\n    - C: 50.73%\n    - D: 75%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How many possible pairs are there in a group of 10 people?\n    - A: 10\n    - B: 20\n    - C: 45\n    - D: 90\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the main focus of the birthday problem in mathematics?\n    - A: Calculating the probability of a person having a birthday on a specific day\n    - B: Calculating the probability of two people sharing the same birthday in a group\n    - C: Calculating the number of possible pairs in a group\n    - D: Calculating the number of people in a group\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why is it easier to calculate the odds that everyone's birthday is different when solving the birthday problem?\n    - A: Because it's a linear function\n    - B: Because it's a non-linear function\n    - C: Because it's easier to subtract from 100% to find the probability of a match\n    - D: Because it reduces the number of possible combinations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A teacher has a classroom of 25 students. What is the probability that at least two students will share the same birthday?\n    - A: Less than 50%\n    - B: Exactly 50%\n    - C: Greater than 50%\n    - D: Cannot be determined\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Which field of mathematics is most relevant to calculating the probability of two events occurring together?\n    - A: Statistics\n    - B: Probability\n    - C: Combinatorics\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of people in a group and the number of possible pairs?\n    - A: Linear\n    - B: Quadratic\n    - C: Exponential\n    - D: Logarithmic\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the birthday problem illustrate about our intuitive understanding of probability?\n    - A: That it is always accurate\n    - B: That it is often inaccurate\n    - C: That it is only accurate for small groups\n    - D: That it is only accurate for large groups\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be gained by combining the concepts of combinatorics and probability?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of linear functions\n    - B: A new insight into the role of chance in everyday events\n    - C: A new understanding of complex problems\n    - D: A new method for calculating probability\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can the birthday problem be used as a starting point for exploring other mathematical concepts?\n    - A: By applying it to real-world scenarios\n    - B: By using it to calculate the number of possible pairs\n    - C: By exploring other non-linear functions and probability theory\n    - D: By critiquing the assumption that coincidences are always unlikely\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the main limitation of relying solely on intuitive understanding when it comes to probability?\n    - A: It's too time-consuming\n    - B: It's too complex\n    - C: It's often inaccurate\n    - D: It's too simple\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential critique of the assumption that coincidences are always unlikely?\n    - A: That they are always likely\n    - B: That they are always unlikely\n    - C: That they may not be as unlikely as they seem\n    - D: That they are impossible\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinement is needed. However, minor adjustments can be made based on further feedback or testing."
