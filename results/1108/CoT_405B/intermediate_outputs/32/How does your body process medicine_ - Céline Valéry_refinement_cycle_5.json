    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of ibuprofen in the human body?\n    - A: To lower blood pressure\n    - B: To treat headaches, sore backs, and sprained ankles by blocking pain signals\n    - C: To neutralize foreign substances in the liver\n    - D: To reduce inflammation in the digestive system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which organ is responsible for filtering out metabolites in the urine?\n    - A: Liver\n    - B: Kidneys\n    - C: Heart\n    - D: Pancreas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What happens to medicine molecules when they react with enzymes in the liver?\n    - A: They become more effective\n    - B: They are neutralized and may no longer be effective\n    - C: They are absorbed into the bloodstream\n    - D: They are broken down into smaller particles\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why is it challenging to determine the right dosage for children?\n    - A: Because their bodies are similar to adults\n    - B: Because their liver enzymes and body functions are rapidly changing\n    - C: Because they have a higher metabolism\n    - D: Because they have a lower liver efficiency\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A person with a liver condition is taking medication. What should they do to ensure safe medication administration?\n    - A: Take a higher dose to compensate for liver inefficiency\n    - B: Take a lower dose to avoid liver overload\n    - C: Consult their doctor to adjust their dosage based on liver function\n    - D: Stop taking medication altogether\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A parent is administering medication to their child. What should they do to ensure safe medication administration?\n    - A: Follow the dosing instructions on the label without adjustment\n    - B: Adjust the dosage based on the child's age and weight\n    - C: Consult their doctor to determine the best dosage for their child\n    - D: Give the child a lower dose to avoid toxicity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the liver and kidneys in eliminating medicine from the body?\n    - A: The liver filters out metabolites, and the kidneys absorb medicine\n    - B: The liver neutralizes medicine, and the kidneys filter out metabolites\n    - C: The liver absorbs medicine, and the kidneys neutralize it\n    - D: The liver and kidneys work independently to eliminate medicine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How do painkillers like ibuprofen affect the body's natural response to pain?\n    - A: They enhance the body's natural response to pain\n    - B: They neutralize the body's natural response to pain\n    - C: They block the production of compounds that help transmit pain signals\n    - D: They increase the production of compounds that help transmit pain signals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the role of the circulatory system in distributing medicine throughout the body?\n    - A: The circulatory system absorbs medicine from the digestive system\n    - B: The circulatory system carries medicine from the liver to the kidneys\n    - C: The circulatory system distributes medicine from the bloodstream to the target areas\n    - D: The circulatory system eliminates medicine from the body\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What happens to ibuprofen molecules when they encounter a location where the body's pain response is in full swing?\n    - A: They bind to specific target molecules and block pain signals\n    - B: They are neutralized by enzymes and eliminated from the body\n    - C: They are absorbed into the bloodstream and carried away\n    - D: They are broken down into smaller particles and reabsorbed\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How does the body eliminate ibuprofen over time?\n    - A: The blood dose decreases by half every hour\n    - B: The blood dose decreases by half every two hours\n    - C: The blood dose remains constant over time\n    - D: The blood dose increases over time\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is personalized medicine based on individual factors such as genetics and liver efficiency necessary?\n    - A: It is not necessary, as medicine labels provide accurate dosing instructions\n    - B: It is somewhat necessary, as individual factors can affect medicine efficacy\n    - C: It is very necessary, as individual factors can significantly impact medicine efficacy and safety\n    - D: It is not possible, as individual factors are too complex to account for\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What is the role of genetics in personalized medicine?\n    - A: Genetics play no role in personalized medicine\n    - B: Genetics can affect medicine efficacy and safety\n    - C: Genetics can determine the best dosage for an individual\n    - D: Genetics can predict an individual's response to medicine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is the main challenge in creating personalized medicine?\n    - A: Developing new medicines\n    - B: Understanding individual factors that affect medicine efficacy and safety\n    - C: Creating precise dosing instructions\n    - D: Ensuring medicine is affordable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) How can routine DNA tests potentially improve personalized medicine?\n    - A: By identifying genetic disorders\n    - B: By determining the best dosage for an individual\n    - C: By predicting an individual's response to medicine\n    - D: By developing new medicines\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAfter reviewing and refining the questions, I found that they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. The correct answers are accurate, and no further refinement is necessary.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
