    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What was Richard Feynman's occupation during World War II?\n    - A: Theoretical physicist in Los Alamos\n    - B: Engineer in the US Army\n    - C: Mathematician in the US Navy\n    - D: Chemist in a private laboratory\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What was the mechanical tolerance of the safes in Los Alamos?\n    - A: Plus or minus 1 on every single number\n    - B: Plus or minus 2 on every single number\n    - C: Plus or minus 5 on every single number\n    - D: Plus or minus 10 on every single number\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What allowed Feynman to develop a method for cracking safes?\n    - A: Technical skills alone\n    - B: Understanding of human behavior alone\n    - C: Combination of technical skills and understanding of human behavior\n    - D: Mechanical tolerance of the safes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What was the result of Feynman's method of trying every fifth combination to account for the mechanical tolerance?\n    - A: The number of possible combinations increased to 2 million\n    - B: The number of possible combinations remained the same\n    - C: The number of possible combinations decreased to 8,000\n    - D: The number of possible combinations decreased to 1,000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What modern-day security concern can be related to Feynman's safe-cracking abilities?\n    - A: Physical security of buildings\n    - B: Password security and encryption\n    - C: Network security and firewalls\n    - D: Database security and access control\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What key takeaway from Feynman's story can be applied to various fields?\n    - A: Importance of using strong passwords\n    - B: Importance of considering human factors in security\n    - C: Importance of using encryption\n    - D: Importance of using firewalls\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How did Feynman's technical skills and understanding of human behavior contribute to his ability to crack safes?\n    - A: Technical skills were more important\n    - B: Understanding of human behavior was more important\n    - C: Both were equally important\n    - D: Neither was important\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What was the effect of Feynman's discovery of the mechanical tolerance on the number of possible combinations?\n    - A: Decreased the number of possible combinations\n    - B: Increased the number of possible combinations\n    - C: Had no effect on the number of possible combinations\n    - D: Changed the type of combinations used\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What can be seen as a form of \"social engineering\" that allowed Feynman to crack safes?\n    - A: Technical skills alone\n    - B: Understanding of human behavior alone\n    - C: Combination of technical skills and understanding of human behavior\n    - D: Mechanical tolerance of the safes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be combined with modern-day security concerns to highlight the importance of considering human factors in security?\n    - A: Story of Feynman's safe-cracking abilities\n    - B: Use of significant dates as combinations\n    - C: Importance of using strong passwords\n    - D: Importance of using encryption\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the security measures in place at Los Alamos be evaluated, given Feynman's ability to crack the safes?\n    - A: Adequate and effective\n    - B: Inadequate and ineffective\n    - C: Neutral and average\n    - D: Unknown and unclear\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) How can Feynman's method for cracking safes be evaluated?\n    - A: Effective and fair\n    - B: Effective but unfair\n    - C: Ineffective and fair\n    - D: Ineffective and unfair\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed no questions, as they all align with the key concepts in the transcript and are clear and concise. I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
