    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible but incorrect distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many pairs of chromosomes do humans have in every cell's nucleus?\n    - A: 20\n    - B: 22\n    - C: 23\n    - D: 25\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What determines biological sex in humans?\n    - A: The number of X chromosomes\n    - B: The presence of a Y chromosome\n    - C: The number of Y chromosomes\n    - D: The number of autosomal chromosomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n3) What is the result of having two versions of each gene, one from each parent?\n    - A: A complete dominance of one trait\n    - B: A combination of traits\n    - C: A mutation of the gene\n    - D: A deletion of the gene\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the purpose of X inactivation in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: To enhance gene expression\n    - B: To reduce gene expression\n    - C: To prevent impaired development\n    - D: To promote cell division\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) A genetic counselor is working with a client who has two X chromosomes. How can understanding X inactivation help the counselor?\n    - A: Predict the likelihood of certain disorders\n    - B: Determine the client's biological sex\n    - C: Identify the client's ancestry\n    - D: Develop a treatment plan for a genetic disorder\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) A forensic analyst is studying a DNA sample from a crime scene. How can X inactivation patterns be used in this context?\n    - A: To identify the perpetrator's biological sex\n    - B: To determine the perpetrator's age\n    - C: To identify the perpetrator and determine relationships\n    - D: To analyze DNA from a specific cell type\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between X inactivation and trait expression?\n    - A: X inactivation has no effect on trait expression\n    - B: X inactivation affects which genes are expressed, leading to variations in traits\n    - C: X inactivation only affects the expression of genes on the Y chromosome\n    - D: X inactivation only affects the expression of genes on the X chromosome in males\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is a key difference between X and Y chromosomes?\n    - A: X chromosomes contain genes for male development and fertility, while Y chromosomes contain genes for various functions\n    - B: X chromosomes contain genes for various functions, while Y chromosomes primarily contain genes for male development and fertility\n    - C: X chromosomes are larger than Y chromosomes\n    - D: Y chromosomes are larger than X chromosomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What factors can influence trait expression and disorder severity in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: Genetic information and environmental factors\n    - B: Genetic information and X inactivation\n    - C: Environmental factors and X inactivation\n    - D: Genetic information, X inactivation, and environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) How can understanding X inactivation provide insights into the development of new treatments for genetic disorders?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for gene therapy\n    - B: By understanding how X inactivation affects gene expression\n    - C: By developing new diagnostic tests for genetic disorders\n    - D: By analyzing the role of environmental factors in gene expression\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is a limitation of genetic information in predicting trait expression?\n    - A: Genetic information is too complex to interpret\n    - B: Genetic information is too simplistic to account for environmental factors\n    - C: Genetic information does not account for the interplay between genes and environment\n    - D: Genetic information does not account for X inactivation and other epigenetic factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n12) Why is it important to consider individual genetic profiles when studying disorders associated with X chromosome mutations?\n    - A: Because X inactivation patterns can influence disorder severity\n    - B: Because genetic information is too complex to interpret\n    - C: Because environmental factors have a greater impact on disorder severity\n    - D: Because genetic information is not accurate enough to predict disorder severity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed."
