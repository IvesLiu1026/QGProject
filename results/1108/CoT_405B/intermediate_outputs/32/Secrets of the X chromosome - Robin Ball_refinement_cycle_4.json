Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many pairs of chromosomes do humans have in every cell's nucleus?\n    - A: 20\n    - B: 22\n    - C: 23\n    - D: 25\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What determines biological sex in humans?\n    - A: The number of X chromosomes\n    - B: The presence of a Y chromosome\n    - C: The number of autosomal chromosomes\n    - D: The ratio of X to Y chromosomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the result of having two versions of each gene, one from each parent?\n    - A: A complete dominance of one trait\n    - B: A combination of traits\n    - C: A mutation of the gene\n    - D: A masking of one trait\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary purpose of X inactivation in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: To enhance gene expression\n    - B: To reduce gene expression\n    - C: To prevent impaired development\n    - D: To regulate cell growth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can understanding X inactivation help a genetic counselor working with a client who has two X chromosomes?\n    - A: Predict the likelihood of certain disorders\n    - B: Determine the client's biological sex\n    - C: Identify the client's ancestry\n    - D: Develop a treatment plan for a genetic disorder\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential application of X inactivation patterns in forensic analysis?\n    - A: To identify the perpetrator's biological sex\n    - B: To determine the perpetrator's age\n    - C: To identify the perpetrator and determine relationships\n    - D: To analyze DNA from a specific cell type\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between X inactivation and trait expression?\n    - A: X inactivation has no effect on trait expression\n    - B: X inactivation affects which genes are expressed, leading to variations in traits\n    - C: X inactivation only affects the expression of genes on the Y chromosome\n    - D: X inactivation only affects the expression of genes on the X chromosome in males\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a key difference between X and Y chromosomes?\n    - A: X chromosomes contain genes for male development and fertility, while Y chromosomes contain genes for various functions\n    - B: X chromosomes contain genes for various functions, while Y chromosomes primarily contain genes for male development and fertility\n    - C: X chromosomes are larger than Y chromosomes\n    - D: Y chromosomes are larger than X chromosomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What factors can influence trait expression and disorder severity in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: Genetic information and environmental factors\n    - B: Genetic information and X inactivation\n    - C: Environmental factors and X inactivation\n    - D: Genetic information, X inactivation, and environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) How can understanding X inactivation provide insights into the development of new treatments for genetic disorders?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for gene therapy\n    - B: By understanding how X inactivation affects gene expression\n    - C: By developing new diagnostic tests for genetic disorders\n    - D: By analyzing the role of environmental factors in gene expression\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a limitation of genetic information in predicting trait expression?\n    - A: Genetic information is too complex to interpret\n    - B: Genetic information is too simplistic to account for environmental factors\n    - C: Genetic information does not account for the interplay between genes and environment\n    - D: Genetic information does not account for X inactivation and other epigenetic factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) Why is it important to consider individual genetic profiles when studying disorders associated with X chromosome mutations?\n    - A: Because X inactivation patterns can influence disorder severity\n    - B: Because genetic information is too complex to interpret\n    - C: Because environmental factors have a greater impact on disorder severity\n    - D: Because genetic information is not accurate enough to predict disorder severity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n13) What is the role of the Y chromosome in human development?\n    - A: To determine biological sex\n    - B: To regulate gene expression\n    - C: To provide genetic information for various traits\n    - D: To influence X inactivation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) How does X inactivation occur in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: Randomly, early in development\n    - B: Non-randomly, based on parental origin\n    - C: In response to environmental factors\n    - D: As a result of genetic mutations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n15) What is the effect of X inactivation on gene expression in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: All genes on the inactive X are silenced\n    - B: Some genes on the inactive X are silenced, while others escape inactivation\n    - C: Genes on the active X are overexpressed\n    - D: Genes on the inactive X are overexpressed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
