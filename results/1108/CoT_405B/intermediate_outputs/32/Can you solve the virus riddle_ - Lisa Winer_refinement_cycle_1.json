    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the name of the problem related to finding a route that visits every point within a graph exactly once?\n    - A: Eulerian Path Problem\n    - B: Hamiltonian Path Problem\n    - C: Shortest Path Problem\n    - D: Traveling Salesman Problem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many rooms are in the lab compound?\n    - A: 8\n    - B: 12\n    - C: 16\n    - D: 20\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the main challenge posed by the lab's layout and security system?\n    - A: Finding a way to destroy the virus in every contaminated room without re-entering a room\n    - B: Finding a way to escape the lab without getting infected\n    - C: Finding a way to disable the security system\n    - D: Finding a way to contain the virus in one room\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) Why is a true Hamiltonian path not possible with the given endpoints in the lab?\n    - A: Due to the lab's rectangular shape\n    - B: Due to the security system's rules\n    - C: Due to the grid's configuration with an even number of rooms on each side\n    - D: Due to the virus's spread\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) Which of the following is a real-world scenario where the Hamiltonian path problem can be applied?\n    - A: Logistics and network design\n    - B: Epidemiology and disease containment\n    - C: Both A and B\n    - D: Neither A nor B\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How can the puzzle be applied to epidemiology?\n    - A: By finding the most efficient way to contain and eliminate a disease\n    - B: By finding the most efficient way to spread a disease\n    - C: By finding the most efficient way to develop a vaccine\n    - D: By finding the most efficient way to treat a disease\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the lab's layout and the security system?\n    - A: They are independent of each other\n    - B: They work together to create a challenge\n    - C: They are mutually exclusive\n    - D: They are irrelevant to the puzzle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the virus's release and the need to destroy it in every contaminated room?\n    - A: The virus's release causes the security system to lockdown\n    - B: The virus's release causes the need to destroy it in every contaminated room to prevent its spread\n    - C: The security system's lockdown causes the virus's release\n    - D: The need to destroy the virus in every contaminated room causes the security system's lockdown\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can combining the knowledge of the lab's layout, the security system, and the Hamiltonian path problem lead to a deeper understanding of the puzzle?\n    - A: By revealing the exception to the security system's rules\n    - B: By revealing the grid's configuration\n    - C: By revealing the relationship between the lab's layout and the security system\n    - D: By revealing the solution to the puzzle, which involves using the entrance room as an exception\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What idea can be combined with the knowledge of the grid's configuration to find a solution to the puzzle?\n    - A: Using the entrance room as an exception to the security system's rules\n    - B: Using the exit room as an exception to the security system's rules\n    - C: Using the contaminated rooms as an exception to the security system's rules\n    - D: Using the security system's rules as an exception to the lab's layout\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the protagonist's decision to grab a HazMat suit and enter the contaminated rooms be evaluated?\n    - A: As a necessary risk to prevent the spread of the virus\n    - B: As an unnecessary risk that puts the protagonist in danger\n    - C: As a reckless decision that ignores the security system's rules\n    - D: As a cautious decision that prioritizes the protagonist's safety above all else\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What can be critiqued about the solution to the puzzle?\n    - A: Its reliance on the exception to the security system's rules\n    - B: Its failure to consider the grid's configuration\n    - C: Its inability to find a true Hamiltonian path\n    - D: Its assumption that the entrance room is not contaminated\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 3, 4, 8, 9, and 12 to enhance clarity and conciseness. The other questions remain unchanged, as they align with the key concepts and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
