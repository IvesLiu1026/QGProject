    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year were gastric-brooding frogs first discovered in Queensland, Australia?\n    - A: 1962\n    - B: 1972\n    - C: 1982\n    - D: 1992\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of the world's frog species were estimated to be in danger due to the chytrid fungus by 2013?\n    - A: 22%\n    - B: 32%\n    - C: 42%\n    - D: 52%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What unique reproductive strategy do gastric-brooding frogs exhibit?\n    - A: They lay eggs in water and the tadpoles develop externally\n    - B: They give birth to live young without swallowing eggs\n    - C: The mother frog swallows the eggs and they develop inside her stomach\n    - D: The father frog carries the eggs until they hatch\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is a significant consequence of the decline of frog species due to the chytrid fungus?\n    - A: It would have a minimal impact on ecosystems\n    - B: It would only affect the local food chain\n    - C: It would have significant impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity\n    - D: It would only affect human health\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What potential benefit could come from understanding the gastric-brooding frog's ability to suppress stomach acid production?\n    - A: Insights into treating human respiratory problems\n    - B: Insights into treating human GI problems\n    - C: Insights into treating human skin problems\n    - D: Insights into treating human eye problems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What concept involves reviving extinct species to restore lost biodiversity?\n    - A: De-extinction\n    - B: Conservation\n    - C: Evolution\n    - D: Adaptation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How does the gastric-brooding frog's reproductive strategy contribute to the protection of its young?\n    - A: It makes the young more vulnerable to predators\n    - B: It has no impact on the young's protection\n    - C: It protects the young from predators and environmental factors\n    - D: It only protects the young from environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between the chytrid fungus and the decline of frog species worldwide?\n    - A: The decline of frog species caused the spread of the chytrid fungus\n    - B: The chytrid fungus has no impact on the decline of frog species\n    - C: The chytrid fungus is a major contributor to the decline of frog species\n    - D: Human activities are the sole cause of the decline of frog species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining knowledge of the gastric-brooding frog's reproductive strategy with understanding of human GI problems?\n    - A: Development of new treatments for human GI problems\n    - B: Development of new treatments for human respiratory problems\n    - C: Development of new treatments for human skin problems\n    - D: Development of new treatments for human eye problems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be a potential outcome of integrating the concept of de-extinction with conservation efforts?\n    - A: Restoration of lost biodiversity\n    - B: Loss of more species\n    - C: No impact on conservation efforts\n    - D: Decrease in ecosystem health\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential concern about attempting to resurrect extinct species like the gastric-brooding frog?\n    - A: It is too expensive\n    - B: It is too time-consuming\n    - C: It may have unintended consequences on ecosystems and conservation efforts\n    - D: It is not scientifically possible\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential justification for attempting to resurrect extinct species like the gastric-brooding frog?\n    - A: To restore lost biodiversity and promote ecosystem health\n    - B: To promote human entertainment\n    - C: To advance scientific knowledge only\n    - D: To justify human activities that contribute to species decline\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12."
