    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What happens to the captain if the majority of pirates vote \"nay\" on the proposed distribution of coins?\n    - A: The captain gets to propose another distribution.\n    - B: The captain walks the plank, and the next pirate in line becomes captain.\n    - C: The captain is given a second chance to convince the pirates.\n    - D: The captain gets to keep all the gold.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What concept is used to predict the reasoning of other pirates in the pirate game?\n    - A: Logical deduction\n    - B: Game theory\n    - C: Common knowledge\n    - D: Nash equilibrium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary goal of each pirate in the pirate game?\n    - A: To become the captain\n    - B: To get as much gold as possible while staying alive\n    - C: To vote against the captain\n    - D: To ensure everyone gets an equal share of gold\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How do pirates use logical deduction in the pirate game?\n    - A: To predict the outcomes of different scenarios and adjust their votes accordingly\n    - B: To convince other pirates to vote for them\n    - C: To determine the rank order of the pirates\n    - D: To decide who gets to be captain\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) Which of the following is a real-world scenario where the pirate game can be applied?\n    - A: A group of friends deciding where to go for dinner\n    - B: A company negotiating a merger with another company\n    - C: A politician trying to pass a bill\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What concept from the pirate game can be applied to situations where individual players need to make strategic decisions based on the actions of others?\n    - A: Game theory\n    - B: Logical deduction\n    - C: Nash equilibrium\n    - D: Common knowledge\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the pirates' votes and the outcome of the game?\n    - A: The pirates' votes have no impact on the outcome of the game.\n    - B: The pirates' votes directly determine the outcome of the game.\n    - C: The pirates' votes influence the outcome of the game, but other factors also play a role.\n    - D: The outcome of the game is determined by chance.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the contrast between the pirates' individual goals and the collective outcome of the game?\n    - A: The pirates' individual goals align with the collective outcome.\n    - B: The pirates' individual goals lead to a suboptimal collective outcome.\n    - C: The pirates' individual goals have no impact on the collective outcome.\n    - D: The collective outcome is determined by chance.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What concepts are combined in the pirate game to create a complex decision-making scenario?\n    - A: Game theory, logical deduction, and strategic thinking\n    - B: Economics, politics, and sociology\n    - C: Psychology, philosophy, and mathematics\n    - D: Biology, chemistry, and physics\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is synthesized from the individual pirates' strategies and the collective outcome of the game?\n    - A: The Nash equilibrium\n    - B: The pirate code\n    - C: The rank order of the pirates\n    - D: The distribution of gold\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can the pirate code be evaluated?\n    - A: As an effective way of distributing gold among the pirates\n    - B: As an ineffective way of distributing gold among the pirates\n    - C: As a morally justifiable way of distributing gold among the pirates\n    - D: As a combination of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What can be evaluated about the Nash equilibrium as a solution to the pirate game?\n    - A: Its effectiveness in achieving a fair distribution of gold\n    - B: Its implications for individual and collective outcomes\n    - C: Its moral justifiability\n    - D: Its relevance to real-world scenarios\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding a few more questions to further assess understanding of the pirate game and its concepts:\n\n13) What is the minimum number of coins Amaro needs to offer to Charlotte and Eliza to secure their votes?\n    - A: 1 coin each\n    - B: 2 coins each\n    - C: 5 coins each\n    - D: 10 coins each\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) What is the outcome for Eliza if she and Daniel are the only two pirates left?\n    - A: She gets to keep all the gold.\n    - B: She gets to propose a new distribution.\n    - C: Daniel gets to keep all the gold.\n    - D: They split the gold equally.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is the purpose of working backwards from the last possible scenario in the pirate game?\n    - A: To determine the rank order of the pirates\n    - B: To predict the outcomes of different scenarios and adjust votes accordingly\n    - C: To decide who gets to be captain\n    - D: To ensure everyone gets an equal share of gold\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for the initial 12 questions."
