    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge** (Recall)\n\n1) How many pairs of chromosomes do humans have in every cell's nucleus?\n    - A: 20\n    - B: 22\n    - C: 23\n    - D: 25\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What determines biological sex in humans?\n    - A: The 1st pair of chromosomes\n    - B: The 23rd pair of chromosomes\n    - C: The number of X chromosomes\n    - D: The number of Y chromosomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension** (Understanding)\n\n1) What is the result of having two versions of each gene, one from each parent?\n    - A: A complete dominance of one trait\n    - B: A combination of traits\n    - C: A mutation of the gene\n    - D: A deletion of the gene\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the purpose of X inactivation in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: To enhance gene expression\n    - B: To reduce gene expression\n    - C: To prevent impaired development\n    - D: To promote mutations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application** (Real-world scenarios)\n\n1) A genetic counselor is working with a client who has two X chromosomes. How can understanding X inactivation help the counselor?\n    - A: Predict the likelihood of certain disorders\n    - B: Determine the client's biological sex\n    - C: Identify the client's ancestry\n    - D: Develop a treatment plan for a genetic disorder\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A forensic analyst is studying a DNA sample from a crime scene. How can X inactivation patterns be used in this context?\n    - A: To identify the perpetrator's biological sex\n    - B: To determine the perpetrator's age\n    - C: To identify the perpetrator and determine relationships\n    - D: To develop a profile of the perpetrator's physical traits\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships and contrasts)\n\n1) What is the relationship between X inactivation and trait expression?\n    - A: X inactivation has no effect on trait expression\n    - B: X inactivation affects which genes are expressed, leading to variations in traits\n    - C: X inactivation only affects the expression of genes on the Y chromosome\n    - D: X inactivation only affects the expression of genes on the X chromosome\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a key difference between X and Y chromosomes?\n    - A: X chromosomes contain genes for male development and fertility, while Y chromosomes contain genes for various functions\n    - B: X chromosomes contain genes for various functions, while Y chromosomes primarily contain genes for male development and fertility\n    - C: X chromosomes are larger than Y chromosomes\n    - D: Y chromosomes are larger than X chromosomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis** (Combining ideas)\n\n1) What factors can influence trait expression and disorder severity in individuals with two X chromosomes?\n    - A: Genetic information and environmental factors\n    - B: Genetic information and X inactivation\n    - C: Environmental factors and X inactivation\n    - D: Genetic information, X inactivation, and environmental factors\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How can understanding X inactivation provide insights into the development of new treatments for genetic disorders?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for gene therapy\n    - B: By understanding how X inactivation affects gene expression\n    - C: By developing new diagnostic tests for genetic disorders\n    - D: By creating new medications to treat genetic disorders\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment and critique)\n\n1) What is a limitation of genetic information in predicting trait expression?\n    - A: Genetic information is too complex to interpret\n    - B: Genetic information is too simplistic to account for environmental factors\n    - C: Genetic information does not account for the interplay between genes and environment\n    - D: Genetic information is not accurate enough to predict trait expression\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is it important to consider individual genetic profiles when studying disorders associated with X chromosome mutations?\n    - A: Because X inactivation patterns can influence disorder severity\n    - B: Because genetic information is too complex to interpret\n    - C: Because environmental factors have a greater impact on disorder severity\n    - D: Because genetic information is not accurate enough to predict disorder severity\n[Correct answer]: A"
