Definition of acknowledging complexity: considering multiple factors that shape what is true in a text.\n5. Example of Toni Morrison's Beloved to illustrate acknowledging complexity.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The importance of looking beyond the surface level of a text to find deeper meaning.\n2. The role of insight in understanding character behavior and motivations.\n3. The role of acknowledging complexity in avoiding simplistic analyses and considering multiple influences on events.\n4. The relationship between insight and complexity in accessing big ideas and deeper meaning in a text.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Using insight to analyze character behavior and motivations in a literary work.\n2. Applying the concept of acknowledging complexity to a literary analysis to avoid simplistic judgments.\n3. Using the two thinking steps to analyze a literary work and arrive at big ideas.\n4. Writing an essay about literature that incorporates insight and complexity.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1.
