    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a distinctive feature of a healthy liver cell in terms of cell division?\n    - A: It divides continuously.\n    - B: It divides only when stressed.\n    - C: It divides erratically.\n    - D: It does not divide at all.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How does the frequency of cell division in a cancer cell compare to that of a healthy hair cell?\n    - A: Cancer cells divide less frequently than healthy hair cells.\n    - B: Cancer cells divide at the same frequency as healthy hair cells.\n    - C: Cancer cells divide more frequently than healthy hair cells.\n    - D: Cancer cells do not divide at all.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) According to the transcript, what was the cancer researcher's opinion on the visualization of cancer cells in the script?\n    - A: It was one of the worst visualizations he had ever seen.\n    - B: It was an average visualization.\n    - C: It was one of the best visualizations he had ever seen.\n    - D: He did not provide any feedback.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What factor determines whether a storyboard is used in the production process, according to the educator?\n    - A: The method used to produce the piece.\n    - B: The experience level of the team members.\n    - C: The complexity of the topic.\n    - D: The availability of resources.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How did creating a storyboard help the educator clarify the concept of chemotherapy's effect on cell reproduction?\n    - A: It oversimplified the concept.\n    - B: It required an extra level of abstraction to figure out the important parts.\n    - C: It did not help at all.\n    - D: It made the concept more complicated.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-5. However, I suggest adding more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript, such as the importance of collaboration and the challenges of visualizing complex concepts.\n\nAdditional questions:\n\n6) What was the outcome of the educator's collaboration with the team on the visualization of cell reproduction?\n    - A: They decided to use a different approach.\n    - B: They created a new storyboard together.\n    - C: They used the educator's rough storyboard.\n    - D: They did not come to an agreement.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What was the challenge faced by the team when trying to visualize the process of cell division and chemotherapy?\n    - A: It was too simple to visualize.\n    - B: It was too complex to visualize.\n    - C: They did not have enough resources.\n    - D: They did not have enough time.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nThese additional questions can help assess the understanding of the key concepts and the importance of collaboration in the production process."
