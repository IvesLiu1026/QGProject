    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How is pressure typically calculated?\n    - A: Force multiplied by area\n    - B: Force divided by area\n    - C: Area divided by force\n    - D: Force minus area\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate speed, in miles per hour, of an object falling from a 32-story building just before impact?\n    - A: 60 miles per hour\n    - B: 94 miles per hour\n    - C: 120 miles per hour\n    - D: 180 miles per hour\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a major challenge of having 1,000 times the strength in everyday tasks?\n    - A: Lack of energy\n    - B: Increased risk of causing damage due to excessive force\n    - C: Decreased agility\n    - D: Reduced flexibility\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why is it not feasible to catch a person from a great fall, even with super strength?\n    - A: Due to the person's weight\n    - B: Due to the immense pressure exerted on the person's body upon impact\n    - C: Due to the distance of the fall\n    - D: Due to air resistance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what situation would understanding pressure be crucial to avoid causing harm?\n    - A: Shaking hands with someone\n    - B: Performing a medical procedure\n    - C: Lifting heavy weights\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) How could someone with the ability to fly potentially save a person from a great fall?\n    - A: By flying down to them and catching them\n    - B: By flying up to them, matching their speed, and gradually slowing down\n    - C: By flying alongside them and pushing them upwards\n    - D: By using a parachute to slow their descent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between force, area, and pressure?\n    - A: Pressure is directly proportional to force and area\n    - B: Pressure is inversely proportional to force and directly proportional to area\n    - C: Pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to area\n    - D: Pressure is inversely proportional to force and area\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between having super strength and being able to save someone from a great fall?\n    - A: Having super strength guarantees saving someone from a great fall\n    - B: Having super strength has no relation to saving someone from a great fall\n    - C: Having super strength does not necessarily enable one to save a person from a great fall\n    - D: Having super strength makes it impossible to save someone from a great fall\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a hypothetical solution to saving someone from a great fall, considering the concept of pressure and super strength?\n    - A: Using super strength to catch the person\n    - B: Flying up to the person, matching their speed, and gradually slowing down\n    - C: Creating a force field to cushion the person's fall\n    - D: Using a giant net to catch the person\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What would be a potential consequence of having super strength in everyday situations?\n    - A: Increased agility and flexibility\n    - B: Enhanced senses and reflexes\n    - C: Difficulty performing tasks due to increased risk of causing damage\n    - D: Reduced energy and endurance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Is it feasible to save someone from a great fall using super strength?\n    - A: Yes, it is always possible\n    - B: No, it is never possible\n    - C: It depends on the situation, but generally, it is not feasible due to the immense pressure exerted on the person's body\n    - D: It is only possible with additional abilities, such as flight\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it essential to consider the physical limitations of super strength in hypothetical scenarios?\n    - A: To create more realistic stories\n    - B: To avoid exaggerating the capabilities of super strength\n    - C: To understand the potential consequences and challenges associated with such a power\n    - D: To make super strength seem more appealing\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
