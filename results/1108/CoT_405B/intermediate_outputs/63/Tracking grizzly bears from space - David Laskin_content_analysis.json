    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Grizzly bears have big teeth and giant claws.\n2. Grizzly bears play a critical role in the function of ecosystems.\n3. Grizzly bears' habitat is dwindling fast.\n4. Grizzly bears have diverse diets that can include up to 90% vegetation.\n5. Grizzly bears hibernate during winter.\n6. Grizzly bears need to pack on enough body fat to survive the winter.\n7. A large male grizzly can eat up to 200,000 berries in a single day.\n8. NASA satellites carry sensors that record spectral signatures of plants.\n9. Grizzly bears can wear GPS collars to monitor their movements.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. Grizzly bears are not as ferocious as they seem and have a critical role in ecosystems.\n2. Grizzly bears' diets consist mainly of plants, which can be challenging to maintain in northern latitudes.\n3. Grizzly bears' behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons.\n4. Grizzly bears need to be highly effective foragers to gain enough weight for winter.\n5. Dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps can be used for grizzly bear conservation.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Understanding grizzly bears' dietary needs can inform conservation efforts.\n2. Analyzing the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants can help identify areas of high-quality habitat.\n3. Using satellite imagery and GPS collars can aid in creating dynamic habitat maps.\n4. Habitat maps can be used to predict the effects of climate change on grizzly bears.\n5. Conservation efforts for grizzly bears can also benefit other species and ecosystems.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between grizzly bears' diets and their habitat.\n2. The contrast between grizzly bears' ferocious appearance and their plant-based diet.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between climate change and grizzly bears' foraging schedules.\n4. The relationship between grizzly bears' hibernation and their need for body fat.\n5. The connection between grizzly bears' movements and the ebb and flow of nutrition in their habitat.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Integrating data from satellite imagery and GPS collars to create dynamic habitat maps.\n2. Combining knowledge of grizzly bears' diets and behaviors to inform conservation efforts.\n3. Considering the impact of climate change on grizzly bears' habitats and ecosystems.\n4. Using grizzly bears as a charismatic symbol to promote conservation efforts for other species.\n5. Understanding the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the role of grizzly bears within them.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of conservation efforts for grizzly bears.\n2. Justifying the use of satellite imagery and GPS collars in conservation efforts.\n3. Critiquing the impact of human activities on grizzly bears' habitats and ecosystems.\n4. Assessing the importance of preserving grizzly bears and their habitats.\n5. Justifying the need for continued research and conservation efforts for grizzly bears and their ecosystems."
