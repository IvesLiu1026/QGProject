    "content_analysis": "Here's the analysis of the transcript, categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1. Autism is a disruption of social resonance that begins at the beginning of life.\n2. Babies are born in a state of fragility and need caregivers to survive.\n3. Nature endows babies with mechanisms of survival, such as orienting to caregivers and preferring human sounds.\n4. Autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders.\n5. There are over 100 genes associated with autism.\n6. The brain is malleable for just so long, and the window of opportunity for intervention is in the first three years of life.\n7. The median age of diagnosis in the US is around five years.\n8. Early treatment can attenuate the condition and have lifetime consequences for the child, family, and community.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The speaker's journey in autism began when they lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.\n2. Individuals with autism are often isolated from the world around them and have difficulty with social interaction.\n3. Autism is not just a disorder of the brain, but also a disorder of the social mind.\n4. The speaker's research focuses on understanding how babies develop social skills and how this relates to autism.\n5. The concept of growth charts can be applied to social engagement in children.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The speaker's research can be applied to real-world situations, such as identifying children with autism early on and providing them with treatment.\n2. The technologies developed by the speaker and their colleagues can be used to help primary care physicians identify children with autism.\n3. The speaker's work can inform the development of universal screening and universal access to treatment for autism.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The speaker identifies a relationship between the development of social skills in babies and the emergence of autism.\n2. The speaker notes that individuals with autism often have difficulty with social interaction and may be isolated from the world around them.\n3. The speaker suggests that the brain's malleability in the first three years of life provides a window of opportunity for intervention and treatment.\n4. The speaker identifies a contrast between the world of things and the world of people, and notes that individuals with autism may have difficulty navigating this divide.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The speaker combines ideas from psychology, neuroscience, and pediatrics to understand the development of social skills in babies and the emergence of autism.\n2. The speaker suggests that early treatment can attenuate the condition and have lifetime consequences for the child, family, and community.\n3. The speaker's work can inform the development of new technologies and methods for identifying and treating autism.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The speaker critiques the current state of diagnosis and treatment for autism, noting that the median age of diagnosis is too late and that many individuals with autism do not receive adequate treatment.\n2. The speaker argues that early treatment can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with autism and their families.\n3. The speaker suggests that the development of universal screening and universal access to treatment for autism is a moral imperative.\n4. The speaker evaluates the effectiveness of their own research and its potential to inform real-world practice."
