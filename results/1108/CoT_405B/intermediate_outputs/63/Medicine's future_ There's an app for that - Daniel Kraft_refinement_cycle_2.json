    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of DNA haplotype did the speaker discover they shared with Harriet?\n    - A: Mitochondrial DNA haplotype X\n    - B: Mitochondrial DNA haplotype Y\n    - C: Rare type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype K 1 a 1 B 1 a\n    - D: Common type of mitochondrial DNA haplotype\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the current cost trend of genome sequencing?\n    - A: Increasing to $1 billion\n    - B: Staying at $1 million\n    - C: Decreasing to $10,000\n    - D: Approaching $1,000 and expected to decrease further\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the concept of \"stage zero medicine\"?\n    - A: Treating diseases after they occur\n    - B: Preventing or curing diseases before they occur\n    - C: Using mobile devices to monitor health metrics\n    - D: Integrating data from multiple sources to understand and treat diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the idea of \"systems medicine\"?\n    - A: Using mobile devices to monitor health metrics\n    - B: Integrating data from multiple sources to understand and treat diseases\n    - C: Preventing or curing diseases before they occur\n    - D: Using artificial intelligence in healthcare\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can mobile devices be used in healthcare?\n    - A: Only for making phone calls\n    - B: Only for sending emails\n    - C: To monitor health metrics, such as blood glucose levels, and access medical data\n    - D: To diagnose diseases without medical professionals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is an example of the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare?\n    - A: Using robots in surgery\n    - B: Using mobile devices to monitor health metrics\n    - C: Diagnosing diseases with AI-assisted radiology\n    - D: Developing brain-computer interfaces\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the potential outcome of integrating data from multiple sources, including genomics, proteomics, and environmental factors?\n    - A: Better health outcomes\n    - B: Worse health outcomes\n    - C: No impact on health outcomes\n    - D: Only improved traditional treatments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the proposed new era of healthcare that combines exponential technologies, personalized medicine, and regenerative medicine?\n    - A: Stage zero medicine\n    - B: Systems medicine\n    - C: Personalized medicine\n    - D: Regenerative medicine\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What is the impact of exponential technologies on the future of healthcare?\n    - A: Exponential technologies will have no impact on healthcare\n    - B: Exponential technologies will only improve traditional treatments\n    - C: Exponential technologies will revolutionize healthcare by enabling personalized medicine and regenerative medicine\n    - D: Exponential technologies will only increase the cost of healthcare\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the reevaluation of the concept of \"disability\"?\n    - A: Technology cannot enable people with disabilities to live more independently\n    - B: Technology can only improve traditional treatments for people with disabilities\n    - C: Technology can enable people with disabilities to live more independently and potentially enhance their abilities\n    - D: The concept of \"disability\" is not related to technology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not essential to the key concepts in the transcript.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
