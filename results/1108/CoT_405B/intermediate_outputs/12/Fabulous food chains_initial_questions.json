What should be at the base of the diagram?\n    - A: A carnivore\n    - B: A herbivore\n    - C: A plant\n    - D: A decomposer\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do humans participate in multiple food chains?\n    - A: By eating only plants\n    - B: By eating only animals\n    - C: By making dietary choices that include a variety of food sources\n    - D: By living in different ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between a predator and its prey in a food chain?\n    - A: Mutualism\n    - B: Commensalism\n    - C: Parasitism\n    - D: Predator-prey relationship\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the role of producers in an ecosystem?\n    - A: To consume energy from other organisms\n    - B: To decompose organic matter\n    - C: To convert sunlight into chemical energy\n    - D: To regulate the population of other organisms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) How do human activities impact the balance of an ecosystem and the flow of energy through a food chain?\n    - A: By increasing the population of producers\n    - B: By decreasing the population of consumers\n    - C: By altering the relationships between organisms and their environment\n    - D: By having no impact on the ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the result of combining the concepts of food chains and ecosystems?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of living things\n    - B: A greater appreciation for the importance of conservation\n    - C: A more complex diagram of energy flow\n    - D: A simpler model of ecosystem dynamics\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Why is it important to understand food chains and ecosystems in managing natural resources?\n    - A: To maximize energy production\n    - B: To minimize human impact on the environment\n    - C: To maintain the balance of ecosystems and ensure sustainable resource use\n    - D: To prioritize economic growth over environmental concerns\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the justification for conservation efforts to protect ecosystems and maintain the balance of food chains?\n    - A: To preserve biodiversity and ensure ecosystem resilience\n    - B: To promote economic growth and development\n    - C: To protect human health and well-being\n    - D: To maintain the status quo in ecosystem management\n[Correct answer]: A"
