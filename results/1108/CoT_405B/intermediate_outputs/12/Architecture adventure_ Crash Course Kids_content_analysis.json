    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. The engineering process is used to solve problems.\n2. The steps in the engineering process include defining the problem, considering options, weighing options, choosing the best design, building a prototype, testing, and refining.\n3. Architecture is a field that involves designing buildings.\n4. Architects use the same process as engineers when planning buildings.\n5. Variables are factors that can affect the success of a design.\n6. Isolating variables is important when conducting trials.\n7. Failure points are potential weaknesses in a design that can cause it to fail.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The importance of defining a problem and considering multiple solutions.\n2. How the engineering process can be applied to real-world problems, such as designing a private space.\n3. The role of architecture in designing buildings that meet specific needs.\n4. The need to test and refine a design to ensure its success.\n5. The concept of variables and how they can affect a design.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Designing a private space, such as a treehouse or a room, that meets specific needs.\n2. Applying the engineering process to solve real-world problems, such as designing a building or a product.\n3. Considering variables and failure points when designing a solution.\n4. Using the engineering process to improve an existing design or product.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. Comparing and contrasting different design options, such as a box, a room, and a treehouse.\n2. Analyzing the relationships between variables, such as the size of a treehouse and its weight.\n3. Identifying potential failure points in a design and developing strategies to mitigate them.\n4. Evaluating the effectiveness of a design in meeting specific needs and criteria.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Combining different design elements, such as a drop-down rope ladder and windows, to create a unique solution.\n2. Integrating multiple variables, such as soundproofing and weight, into a single design.\n3. Using the engineering process to combine different ideas and create a new solution.\n4. Developing a new design that meets specific needs and criteria.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of a design in meeting specific needs and criteria.\n2. Justifying the choice of a particular design element, such as a treehouse, over other options.\n3. Critiquing a design for its potential weaknesses and failure points.\n4. Defending the use of the engineering process in designing a solution."
