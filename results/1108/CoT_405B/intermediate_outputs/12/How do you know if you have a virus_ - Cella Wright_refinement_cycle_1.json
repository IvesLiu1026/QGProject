    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two main viral testing techniques used to contain the spread of a virus?\n    - A: PCR and spectroscopy\n    - B: PCR and immunoassays\n    - C: Immunoassays and chromatography\n    - D: PCR and ELISA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of genetic material does SARS-CoV-2 use to encode its genetic information?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: RNA\n    - C: Proteins\n    - D: Chromatin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How does PCR work in detecting a virus's genetic material?\n    - A: By targeting virus-specific antibodies generated by the immune system\n    - B: By sequencing the genetic material of the virus\n    - C: By identifying unique regions of the virus\n    - D: By amplifying genetic information to detect the virus's genetic material\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is the importance of immunoassays in diagnosing viral infections?\n    - A: They can only diagnose current infections\n    - B: They can only diagnose past infections\n    - C: They can retroactively diagnose people who were infected but went untested\n    - D: They are not useful in diagnosing viral infections\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A new virus has been identified, and health officials want to contain its spread. Which testing techniques would be most effective in this scenario?\n    - A: PCR only\n    - B: Immunoassays only\n    - C: Both PCR and immunoassays\n    - D: Neither PCR nor immunoassays\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the benefit of using digital PCR in viral testing?\n    - A: It is faster than traditional PCR\n    - B: It is cheaper than traditional PCR\n    - C: It can quantify individual pieces of target DNA and boost accuracy\n    - D: It is less accurate than traditional PCR\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between PCR and immunoassays in containing the spread of a virus?\n    - A: They serve the same purpose and can be used interchangeably\n    - B: They serve different purposes and are both critical for containing the spread of a virus\n    - C: PCR is more important than immunoassays\n    - D: Immunoassays are more important than PCR\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the difference between IgM and IgG antibodies?\n    - A: IgM suggests a past infection, while IgG indicates a current infection\n    - B: IgM suggests a recent infection, while IgG indicates exposure and recovery\n    - C: IgM and IgG are the same type of antibody\n    - D: IgM is more important than IgG\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can combining PCR and immunoassay results help in understanding the spread of a virus?\n    - A: It can help identify the source of the virus\n    - B: It can help develop effective containment strategies\n    - C: It can help diagnose individual cases\n    - D: It is not useful in understanding the spread of a virus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of integrating knowledge of viral genetic material and immune system responses?\n    - A: It can lead to the development of new testing techniques\n    - B: It can lead to the development of new treatments\n    - C: It can lead to a better understanding of the virus\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a limitation of immunoassays in diagnosing viral infections?\n    - A: They are not accurate\n    - B: They are not sensitive\n    - C: They take time to produce detectable amounts of antibodies\n    - D: They are not specific\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential benefit of using self-contained testing devices and digital PCR?\n    - A: They are cheaper than traditional testing methods\n    - B: They are faster than traditional testing methods\n    - C: They are more accurate and efficient than traditional testing methods\n    - D: They are less accurate and efficient than traditional testing methods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo major changes were made to the questions, but some minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
