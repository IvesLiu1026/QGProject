Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two main viral testing techniques used to contain the spread of a virus?\n    - A: PCR and spectroscopy\n    - B: PCR and immunoassays\n    - C: Immunoassays and chromatography\n    - D: PCR and ELISA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of genetic material does SARS-CoV-2 use to encode its genetic information?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: RNA\n    - C: Proteins\n    - D: Chromatin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of PCR in viral testing?\n    - A: To target virus-specific antibodies\n    - B: To sequence the genetic material of the virus\n    - C: To identify unique regions of the virus\n    - D: To amplify genetic information for detection\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) How does PCR work in detecting a virus's genetic material?\n    - A: By targeting virus-specific antibodies generated by the immune system\n    - B: By sequencing the genetic material of the virus\n    - C: By identifying unique regions of the virus\n    - D: By amplifying genetic information to detect the virus's genetic material\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is the importance of immunoassays in diagnosing viral infections?\n    - A: They can only diagnose current infections\n    - B: They can only diagnose past infections\n    - C: They can retroactively diagnose people who were infected but went untested\n    - D: They are not useful in diagnosing viral infections\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A new virus has been identified, and health officials want to contain its spread. Which testing techniques would be most effective in this scenario?\n    - A: PCR only\n    - B: Immunoassays only\n    - C: Both PCR and immunoassays\n    - D: Neither PCR nor immunoassays\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the benefit of using digital PCR in viral testing?\n    - A: It is faster than traditional PCR\n    - B: It is cheaper than traditional PCR\n    - C: It can quantify individual pieces of target DNA and boost accuracy\n    - D: It is less accurate than traditional PCR\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between PCR and immunoassays in containing the spread of a virus?\n    - A: They serve the same purpose and can be used interchangeably\n    - B: They serve different purposes and are both critical for containing the spread of a virus\n    - C: PCR is more important than immunoassays\n    - D: Immunoassays are more important than PCR\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the difference between IgM and IgG antibodies?\n    - A: IgM suggests a past infection, while IgG indicates a current infection\n    - B: IgM suggests a recent infection, while IgG indicates exposure and recovery\n    - C: IgM and IgG are the same type of antibody\n    - D: IgM is more important than IgG\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of integrating knowledge of viral genetic material and immune system responses?\n    - A: It can lead to the development of new testing techniques\n    - B: It can lead to the development of new treatments\n    - C: It can lead to a better understanding of the virus\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a limitation of immunoassays in diagnosing viral infections?\n    - A: They are not accurate\n    - B: They are not sensitive\n    - C: They take time to produce detectable amounts of antibodies\n    - D: They are not specific\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a challenge associated with using immunoassays for diagnosing current infections?\n    - A: Lack of accuracy\n    - B: Limited sensitivity\n    - C: Time required to produce detectable antibodies\n    - D: Cross-reactivity with other viruses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What is a potential benefit of using self-contained testing devices and digital PCR?\n    - A: They are cheaper than traditional testing methods\n    - B: They are faster than traditional testing methods\n    - C: They are more accurate and efficient than traditional testing methods\n    - D: They are less accurate and efficient than traditional testing methods\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 14 and 15 as they were redundant and not providing any new information. I also refined some of the questions to make them more concise and clear. No more refinement needed."
