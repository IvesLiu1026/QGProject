Which testing techniques would be most effective in this scenario?\n    - A: PCR only\n    - B: Immunoassays only\n    - C: Both PCR and immunoassays\n    - D: Neither PCR nor immunoassays\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the benefit of using digital PCR in viral testing?\n    - A: It is faster than traditional PCR\n    - B: It is cheaper than traditional PCR\n    - C: It can quantify individual pieces of target DNA and boost accuracy\n    - D: It is less accurate than traditional PCR\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between PCR and immunoassays in containing the spread of a virus?\n    - A: They serve the same purpose and can be used interchangeably\n    - B: They serve different purposes and are both critical for containing the spread of a virus\n    - C: PCR is more important than immunoassays\n    - D: Immunoassays are more important than PCR\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the difference between IgM and IgG antibodies?\n    - A: IgM suggests a past infection, while IgG indicates a current infection\n    - B: IgM suggests a recent infection, while IgG indicates exposure and recovery\n    - C: IgM and IgG are the same type of antibody\n    - D: IgM is more important than IgG\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) How can combining PCR and immunoassay results help in understanding the spread of a virus?\n    - A: It can help identify the source of the virus\n    - B: It can help develop effective containment strategies\n    - C: It can help diagnose individual cases\n    - D: It is not useful in understanding the spread of a virus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential benefit of integrating knowledge of viral genetic material and immune system responses?\n    - A: It can lead to the development of new testing techniques\n    - B: It can lead to the development of new treatments\n    - C: It can lead to a better understanding of the virus\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) What is a limitation of immunoassays in diagnosing viral infections?\n    - A: They are not accurate\n    - B: They are not sensitive\n    - C: They take time to produce detectable amounts of antibodies\n    - D: They are not specific\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential benefit of using self-contained testing devices and digital PCR?\n    - A: They are cheaper than traditional testing methods\n    - B: They are faster than traditional testing methods\n    - C: They are more accurate and efficient than traditional testing methods\n    - D: They are less accurate and efficient than traditional testing methods\n[Correct answer]: C"
