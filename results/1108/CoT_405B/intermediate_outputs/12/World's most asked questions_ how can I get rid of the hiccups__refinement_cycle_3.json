    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many people use the internet daily?\n    - A: Over 1 billion\n    - B: Over 1.5 billion\n    - C: Over 2 billion\n    - D: Over 2.5 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to the SciShow survey, what percentage of respondents prefer holding their breath to relieve hiccups?\n    - A: 37%\n    - B: 45%\n    - C: 54%\n    - D: 67%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What occurs when the diaphragm contracts suddenly during a hiccup?\n    - A: The vocal folds open, and a gulp of air exits the lungs.\n    - B: The vocal folds clamp shut, and a gulp of air enters the lungs.\n    - C: The diaphragm relaxes, and breathing becomes normal.\n    - D: The vagus nerve is stimulated, and the hiccup stops.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the role of the vagus nerve in regulating the diaphragm during hiccups?\n    - A: To stimulate the diaphragm to contract more frequently\n    - B: To distract the diaphragm from constantly contracting\n    - C: To regulate the heartbeat only\n    - D: To increase CO2 levels in the blood\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) (Removed due to duplication with question 4)\n\n6) What is a possible way to relieve hiccups by stimulating the vagus nerve?\n    - A: Holding one's breath for a long time\n    - B: Drinking a large amount of water\n    - C: Eating a spoonful of sugar\n    - D: Breathing into a paper bag\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How can one relieve hiccups by increasing CO2 levels?\n    - A: By breathing deeply and slowly\n    - B: By holding one's breath or breathing into a paper bag\n    - C: By drinking a large amount of water\n    - D: By eating a spoonful of sugar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between the diaphragm, vagus nerve, and CO2 levels in hiccup formation and relief?\n    - A: The diaphragm and vagus nerve work together to regulate CO2 levels.\n    - B: The diaphragm contracts suddenly, causing the vagus nerve to stimulate and increase CO2 levels.\n    - C: The vagus nerve regulates the diaphragm, which affects CO2 levels and hiccup formation.\n    - D: CO2 levels have no effect on the diaphragm and vagus nerve during hiccups.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) (Removed due to duplication with question 8)\n\n10) What is the main difference between the hiccup remedies of sugar, holding one's breath, and drinking water?\n    - A: Sugar stimulates the vagus nerve, while holding one's breath and drinking water increase CO2 levels.\n    - B: Holding one's breath and drinking water stimulate the vagus nerve, while sugar increases CO2 levels.\n    - C: All three remedies work by stimulating the vagus nerve.\n    - D: All three remedies work by increasing CO2 levels.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How can understanding the diaphragm's role in hiccup formation and the vagus nerve's role in regulating the diaphragm lead to effective hiccup remedies?\n    - A: By developing methods to stimulate the vagus nerve and regulate CO2 levels.\n    - B: By creating remedies that only target the diaphragm.\n    - C: By ignoring the role of the vagus nerve and focusing on CO2 levels.\n    - D: By developing remedies that have no scientific basis.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a potential area of research for new hiccup relief methods?\n    - A: Exploring ways to stimulate the vagus nerve or regulate CO2 levels.\n    - B: Investigating the role of the diaphragm in hiccup formation.\n    - C: Developing remedies that target the vocal folds.\n    - D: Studying the relationship between hiccups and internet usage.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n13) Which of the following statements is true regarding the effectiveness of hiccup remedies?\n    - A: Sugar is the most effective remedy because it stimulates the vagus nerve.\n    - B: Holding one's breath is the most effective remedy because it increases CO2 levels.\n    - C: Drinking water is the most effective remedy because it stimulates the vagus nerve and increases CO2 levels.\n    - D: There is not enough evidence to determine the most effective remedy.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n14) What is a valid critique of some hiccup remedies?\n    - A: They are too expensive.\n    - B: They are not widely available.\n    - C: They lack a scientific basis and require further research.\n    - D: They are too complicated to use.\n[Correct answer]: C"
