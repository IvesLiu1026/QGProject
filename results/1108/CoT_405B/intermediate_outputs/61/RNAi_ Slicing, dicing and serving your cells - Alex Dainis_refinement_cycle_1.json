    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What molecule acts as a messenger between DNA and the ribosome, carrying genetic information for protein synthesis?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: RNA\n    - C: Protein\n    - D: Amino acid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which protein is responsible for chopping up long, double-stranded RNA molecules into smaller pieces during the RNA interference process?\n    - A: Slicer\n    - B: Dicer\n    - C: RISC\n    - D: RNAi\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the RISC complex in RNA interference?\n    - A: To create short snippets of RNA\n    - B: To target matching mRNA for destruction\n    - C: To translate mRNA into protein\n    - D: To replicate DNA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential therapeutic application of RNAi, and how can it be used to treat diseases?\n    - A: To target cancer-causing genes and prevent their expression\n    - B: To improve crop yields and agricultural productivity\n    - C: To understand the function of specific genes in various organisms\n    - D: To develop new treatments for infectious diseases\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) A researcher wants to study the function of a specific gene in the brain. What technique could they use to knock down the gene and observe its effects?\n    - A: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing\n    - B: RNA interference (RNAi)\n    - C: Gene therapy\n    - D: Gene expression analysis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A pharmaceutical company is developing a new treatment for cancer. What technique could they use to target cancer-causing genes in tumor cells?\n    - A: RNA interference (RNAi)\n    - B: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing\n    - C: Gene therapy\n    - D: Chemotherapy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between RNAi and gene expression?\n    - A: RNAi promotes gene expression by increasing mRNA levels\n    - B: RNAi prevents gene expression by targeting and destroying mRNA\n    - C: RNAi has no effect on gene expression\n    - D: RNAi regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin structure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the function of RNA in protein synthesis differ from its function in RNAi?\n    - A: RNA acts as a messenger in both processes, carrying genetic information\n    - B: RNA targets and destroys mRNA in both processes\n    - C: RNA acts as a messenger in protein synthesis, but targets and destroys mRNA in RNAi\n    - D: RNA has no role in protein synthesis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining RNAi with CRISPR technology?\n    - A: Development of new tools for gene editing and regulation\n    - B: Improved crop yields and agricultural productivity\n    - C: Targeted cancer therapy with increased efficacy\n    - D: Increased gene expression and protein production\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What could be a potential application of using RNAi to study non-coding RNAs?\n    - A: Development of new treatments for diseases\n    - B: Understanding the function of non-coding RNAs in regulating gene expression\n    - C: Improving crop yields and agricultural productivity\n    - D: Targeted cancer therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential risk of using RNAi as a therapeutic tool?\n    - A: Unintended off-target effects on non-target genes\n    - B: Increased gene expression and protein production\n    - C: Decreased gene expression and protein production\n    - D: No risks or side effects\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is an important consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of RNAi in targeting specific genes?\n    - A: The specificity of the RNAi construct and its potential off-target effects\n    - B: The efficiency of the delivery method and its potential toxicity\n    - C: The potential for off-target effects and their impact on gene expression\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also added more specific details to some questions to make them more accurate and relevant to the topic."
