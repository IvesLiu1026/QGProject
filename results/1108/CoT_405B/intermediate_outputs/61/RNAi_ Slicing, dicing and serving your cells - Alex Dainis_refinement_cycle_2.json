    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What molecule acts as a messenger between DNA and the ribosome, carrying genetic information for protein synthesis?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: Protein\n    - C: Amino acid\n    - D: RNA\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Which protein is responsible for chopping up long, double-stranded RNA molecules into smaller pieces during the RNA interference process?\n    - A: Slicer\n    - B: RISC\n    - C: RNAi\n    - D: Dicer\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the primary function of the RISC complex in RNA interference?\n    - A: To create short snippets of RNA\n    - B: To translate mRNA into protein\n    - C: To replicate DNA\n    - D: To target matching mRNA for destruction\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is a potential therapeutic application of RNAi?\n    - A: To improve crop yields and agricultural productivity\n    - B: To understand the function of specific genes in various organisms\n    - C: To develop new treatments for infectious diseases\n    - D: To target cancer-causing genes and prevent their expression\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) A researcher wants to study the function of a specific gene in the brain. What technique could they use to knock down the gene and observe its effects?\n    - A: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing\n    - B: Gene therapy\n    - C: Gene expression analysis\n    - D: RNA interference (RNAi)\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) A pharmaceutical company is developing a new treatment for cancer. What technique could they use to target cancer-causing genes in tumor cells?\n    - A: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing\n    - B: Gene therapy\n    - C: Chemotherapy\n    - D: RNA interference (RNAi)\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between RNAi and gene expression?\n    - A: RNAi promotes gene expression by increasing mRNA levels\n    - B: RNAi has no effect on gene expression\n    - C: RNAi regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin structure\n    - D: RNAi prevents gene expression by targeting and destroying mRNA\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) How does the function of RNA in protein synthesis differ from its function in RNAi?\n    - A: RNA acts as a messenger in both processes, carrying genetic information\n    - B: RNA targets and destroys mRNA in both processes\n    - C: RNA has no role in protein synthesis\n    - D: RNA acts as a messenger in protein synthesis, but targets and destroys mRNA in RNAi\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) What could be a potential outcome of combining RNAi with CRISPR technology?\n    - A: Improved crop yields and agricultural productivity\n    - B: Targeted cancer therapy with increased efficacy\n    - C: Increased gene expression and protein production\n    - D: Development of new tools for gene editing and regulation\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What could be a potential application of using RNAi to study non-coding RNAs?\n    - A: Development of new treatments for diseases\n    - B: Understanding the function of non-coding RNAs in regulating gene expression\n    - C: Improving crop yields and agricultural productivity\n    - D: Targeted cancer therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential risk of using RNAi as a therapeutic tool?\n    - A: Decreased gene expression and protein production\n    - B: Increased gene expression and protein production\n    - C: No risks or side effects\n    - D: Unintended off-target effects on non-target genes\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is an important consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of RNAi in targeting specific genes?\n    - A: The specificity of the RNAi construct and its potential off-target effects\n    - B: The efficiency of the delivery method and its potential toxicity\n    - C: The potential for off-target effects and their impact on gene expression\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
