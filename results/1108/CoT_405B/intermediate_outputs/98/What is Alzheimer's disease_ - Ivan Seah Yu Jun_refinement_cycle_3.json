    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure alignment with key concepts, clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who first described the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in 1901?\n    - A: Dr. Alois Alzheimer\n    - B: Dr. Sigmund Freud\n    - C: Dr. James Parkinson\n    - D: Dr. Henry Head\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What protein collapses into twisted strands, forming neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Beta-amyloid\n    - B: Tau\n    - C: Acetylcholine\n    - D: Dopamine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary effect of the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The growth of new nerve cells\n    - B: The disruption of communication between nerve cells\n    - C: The death of nerve cells\n    - D: The formation of new memories\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the current status of a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: A cure has been found and is widely available\n    - B: A cure is in the final stages of development and will be available soon\n    - C: A cure has not yet been found, but temporary treatments are available\n    - D: Researchers have stopped searching for a cure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is one of the primary benefits of understanding the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It allows researchers to develop more effective treatments\n    - B: It enables individuals to seek medical attention and receive timely treatment\n    - C: It helps to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - D: It improves cognitive function in individuals with the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can the study of Alzheimer's disease inform the development of treatments for other disorders?\n    - A: By providing insight into the causes and effects of neurodegenerative diseases\n    - B: By identifying potential treatments that can be applied to other diseases\n    - C: By developing new diagnostic tools for other diseases\n    - D: By understanding the genetic factors that contribute to the disease\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between plaques and tangles in causing Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Plaques and tangles are two separate causes of the disease\n    - B: Plaques cause the disease, while tangles are a secondary effect\n    - C: Tangles cause the disease, while plaques are a secondary effect\n    - D: Plaques and tangles work together to cause the disease\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the impact of Alzheimer's disease on individuals and society?\n    - A: It only affects individuals with the disease\n    - B: It only affects the families of individuals with the disease\n    - C: It has a significant emotional and economic burden on individuals and society\n    - D: It has a minimal impact on individuals and society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the role of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It is responsible for processing logical thoughts\n    - B: It is responsible for controlling emotions\n    - C: It is responsible for regulating heart rate and breathing\n    - D: It is responsible for forming memories\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The cost of the treatment\n    - B: The potential side effects of the treatment\n    - C: The impact of the treatment on the progression of the disease\n    - D: The availability of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the potential benefits and risks of new treatments, such as vaccines?\n    - A: The potential for a cure\n    - B: The potential for slowing down the progression of the disease\n    - C: The potential risks and benefits of the treatment\n    - D: The cost of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the current focus of researchers in terms of finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Developing a vaccine to prevent the disease\n    - B: Developing a treatment to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - C: Understanding the causes and effects of the disease\n    - D: Developing a cure for the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI have removed questions 13-15 as they were redundant or not clearly aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. The refined questions are clear, concise, and accurate, with plausible distractors and correct answers. No further refinement is necessary."
