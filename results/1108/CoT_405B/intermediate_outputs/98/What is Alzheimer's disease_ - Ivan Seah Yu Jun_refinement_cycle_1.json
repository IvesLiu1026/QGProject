    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Who first described the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in 1901?\n    - A: Dr. Alois Alzheimer\n    - B: Dr. Sigmund Freud\n    - C: Dr. James Parkinson\n    - D: Dr. Henry Head\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What protein collapses into twisted strands, forming neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Beta-amyloid\n    - B: Tau\n    - C: Acetylcholine\n    - D: Dopamine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary effect of the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The growth of new nerve cells\n    - B: The death of nerve cells\n    - C: The formation of new memories\n    - D: The improvement of cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the current status of a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: A cure has been found and is widely available\n    - B: A cure is in the final stages of development and will be available soon\n    - C: A cure has not yet been found, but temporary treatments are available\n    - D: A cure is not possible due to the complexity of the disease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is one of the primary benefits of understanding the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It allows researchers to develop more effective treatments\n    - B: It enables individuals to seek medical attention and receive timely treatment\n    - C: It helps to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - D: It improves cognitive function in individuals with the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How can the study of Alzheimer's disease inform the development of treatments for other disorders?\n    - A: By providing insight into the causes and effects of neurodegenerative diseases\n    - B: By identifying potential treatments that can be applied to other diseases\n    - C: By developing new diagnostic tools for other diseases\n    - D: By improving our understanding of the brain and its functions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between plaques and tangles in causing Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Plaques and tangles are two separate causes of the disease\n    - B: Plaques cause the disease, while tangles are a secondary effect\n    - C: Tangles cause the disease, while plaques are a secondary effect\n    - D: Plaques and tangles work together to cause the disease\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the impact of Alzheimer's disease on individuals and society?\n    - A: It only affects individuals with the disease\n    - B: It only affects the families of individuals with the disease\n    - C: It has a significant emotional and economic burden on individuals and society\n    - D: It has no impact on individuals and society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can combining knowledge of the causes and effects of Alzheimer's disease contribute to the development of new treatments?\n    - A: By identifying new targets for treatment\n    - B: By improving our understanding of the disease's progression\n    - C: By developing more effective diagnostic tools\n    - D: By combining all of the above to develop more effective interventions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the potential benefit of integrating understanding of the disease's progression with research on potential treatments?\n    - A: It may lead to the development of a cure\n    - B: It may slow down the progression of the disease\n    - C: It may improve cognitive function in individuals with the disease\n    - D: It may lead to the development of more effective interventions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The cost of the treatment\n    - B: The potential side effects of the treatment\n    - C: The impact of the treatment on the progression of the disease\n    - D: The availability of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the potential benefits and risks of new treatments, such as vaccines?\n    - A: The potential for a cure\n    - B: The potential for slowing down the progression of the disease\n    - C: The potential risks and benefits of the treatment\n    - D: The availability of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 1-4 and 6-12 to improve clarity and concision. I rephrased question 5 to better align with the transcript. No significant changes were made to the distractors or correct answers."
