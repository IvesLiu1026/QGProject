    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following megafauna still survives in parts of Africa and Asia?\n    - A: Ground sloths\n    - B: Saber-toothed cats\n    - C: Elephants\n    - D: Giant armadillos\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What is the estimated wingspan of the bird considered as megafauna?\n    - A: 10 feet\n    - B: 15 feet\n    - C: 20 feet\n    - D: 26 feet\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What are \"ghost ecosystems\" referring to?\n    - A: Ecosystems that have been completely destroyed by human activities\n    - B: Remaining species that adapted to threats from extinct species\n    - C: Ecosystems that have been restored through rewilding initiatives\n    - D: Ecosystems with no biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the primary goal of rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: To reintroduce invasive species into ecosystems\n    - B: To restore ecosystems by reintroducing lost species and letting nature take its course\n    - C: To promote commercial activities in protected areas\n    - D: To control population growth of certain species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) Which of the following is an example of applying the concept of rewilding to restore ecosystems?\n    - A: Creating zoos to conserve endangered species\n    - B: Using abandoned farms to restore ecosystems and reintroduce lost species\n    - C: Implementing strict conservation laws to protect ecosystems\n    - D: Promoting sustainable agriculture practices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) What is one potential way to promote biodiversity in marine ecosystems?\n    - A: Implementing commercial fishing-free zones\n    - B: Creating artificial reefs\n    - C: Introducing invasive species\n    - D: Reducing marine protected areas\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is a primary cause of ecosystem degradation in many cases?\n    - A: Natural disasters\n    - B: Human activities such as hunting and farming\n    - C: Climate change\n    - D: Invasive species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined question:\n7) What is a primary driver of ecosystem degradation and megafauna decline?\n    - A: Natural disasters\n    - B: Human activities such as hunting and farming\n    - C: Climate change\n    - D: Invasive species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) This question is similar to question 7, so it's removed to avoid duplication.\n\n9) What is the potential impact of rewilding on ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity?\n    - A: It can lead to a decrease in biodiversity\n    - B: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - C: It can lead to an increase in biodiversity and promote ecosystem change\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is the potential benefit of combining the concepts of megafauna, ghost ecosystems, and rewilding?\n    - A: It can help understand the potential for ecosystem restoration\n    - B: It can lead to a decrease in biodiversity\n    - C: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the potential outcome of integrating the idea of trophic cascades with rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: It can lead to a decrease in biodiversity\n    - B: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - C: It can promote ecosystem change and increase biodiversity\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is one potential risk of using genetic material to bring back extinct species?\n    - A: It can lead to an increase in biodiversity\n    - B: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - C: It can disrupt the balance of ecosystems and lead to unintended consequences\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n13) How can the effectiveness of rewilding initiatives be assessed?\n    - A: By measuring the increase in human activities in the area\n    - B: By monitoring the decrease in biodiversity\n    - C: By evaluating the increase in ecosystem services and biodiversity\n    - D: By assessing the economic benefits of rewilding\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n14) What is a trophic cascade, and how can it be related to rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: A change in the food chain that has no impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - B: A change at the top of the food chain that affects every level\n    - C: A change in the food chain that only affects certain species\n    - D: A change in the food chain that is only relevant in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n15) Why is it essential to obtain human consent and enthusiasm in rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: To ensure the success of rewilding initiatives\n    - B: To promote commercial activities in protected areas\n    - C: To control population growth of certain species\n    - D: To reintroduce invasive species into ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined question:\n15) Why is human consent and enthusiasm crucial for rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: To ensure the long-term success and sustainability of rewilding efforts\n    - B: To promote commercial activities in protected areas\n    - C: To control population growth of certain species\n    -
