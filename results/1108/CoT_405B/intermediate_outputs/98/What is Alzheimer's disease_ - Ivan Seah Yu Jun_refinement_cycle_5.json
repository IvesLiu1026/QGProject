Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who first described the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in 1901?\n    - A: Dr. Alois Alzheimer\n    - B: Dr. Sigmund Freud\n    - C: Dr. James Parkinson\n    - D: Dr. Henry Head\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What protein collapses into twisted strands, forming neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Beta-amyloid\n    - B: Tau\n    - C: Acetylcholine\n    - D: Dopamine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary effect of the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The disruption of communication between nerve cells\n    - B: The growth of new nerve cells\n    - C: The formation of new memories\n    - D: The increase in cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What is the current status of a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: A cure has been found and is widely available\n    - B: A cure is in the final stages of development and will be available soon\n    - C: A cure has not yet been found, but temporary treatments are available\n    - D: Researchers have stopped searching for a cure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is the primary benefit of understanding the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It enables researchers to develop more effective treatments\n    - B: It allows individuals to seek medical attention and receive timely treatment\n    - C: It helps to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - D: It improves cognitive function in individuals with the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the significance of studying Alzheimer's disease in relation to other neurodegenerative disorders?\n    - A: It provides insight into the causes and effects of neurodegenerative diseases\n    - B: It identifies potential treatments that can be applied to other diseases\n    - C: It develops new diagnostic tools for other diseases\n    - D: It understands the genetic factors that contribute to the disease\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do plaques and tangles contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Plaques and tangles are two separate causes of the disease\n    - B: Plaques cause the disease, while tangles are a secondary effect\n    - C: Tangles cause the disease, while plaques are a secondary effect\n    - D: Plaques and tangles work together to cause the disease\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the impact of Alzheimer's disease on individuals and society?\n    - A: It only affects individuals with the disease\n    - B: It only affects the families of individuals with the disease\n    - C: It has a significant emotional and economic burden on individuals and society\n    - D: It has a minimal impact on individuals and society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the role of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It is responsible for processing logical thoughts\n    - B: It is responsible for controlling emotions\n    - C: It is responsible for regulating heart rate and breathing\n    - D: It is responsible for forming memories\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The cost of the treatment\n    - B: The potential side effects of the treatment\n    - C: The impact of the treatment on the progression of the disease\n    - D: The availability of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the potential benefits and risks of new treatments, such as vaccines?\n    - A: The potential for a cure\n    - B: The potential for slowing down the progression of the disease\n    - C: The potential risks and benefits of the treatment\n    - D: The cost of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the current focus of researchers in terms of finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Developing a vaccine to prevent the disease\n    - B: Developing a treatment to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - C: Understanding the causes and effects of the disease\n    - D: Developing a cure for the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is the role of beta-amyloid proteins in the formation of plaques in Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: They help to break down the brain's structure\n    - B: They contribute to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles\n    - C: They are involved in the disruption of communication between nerve cells\n    - D: They are a type of protein that helps to clear plaques from the brain\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) How do plaques and tangles affect the brain's structure and function in Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: They cause the growth of new nerve cells\n    - B: They disrupt communication between nerve cells and lead to cell death\n    - C: They have no impact on the brain's structure and function\n    - D: They only affect the brain's emotional centers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What is the significance of understanding the progression of Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It helps researchers to develop more effective treatments\n    - B: It enables individuals to seek medical attention and receive timely treatment\n    - C: It helps to slow down the progression of the disease\n    -
