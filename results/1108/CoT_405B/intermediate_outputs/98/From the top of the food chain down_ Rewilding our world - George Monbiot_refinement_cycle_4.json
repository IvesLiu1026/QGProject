    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which of the following megafauna is mentioned as still surviving in parts of Africa and Asia?\n    - A: Ground sloths\n    - B: Saber-toothed cats\n    - C: Elephants\n    - D: Giant armadillos\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the estimated wingspan of the bird considered as megafauna?\n    - A: 10 feet\n    - B: 15 feet\n    - C: 20 feet\n    - D: 26 feet\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What are \"ghost ecosystems\" referring to?\n    - A: Ecosystems that have been completely destroyed by human activities\n    - B: Remaining species that adapted to threats from extinct species\n    - C: Ecosystems that have been restored through rewilding initiatives\n    - D: Ecosystems with no biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary goal of rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: To reintroduce invasive species into ecosystems\n    - B: To restore ecosystems by reintroducing lost species and letting nature take its course\n    - C: To promote commercial activities in protected areas\n    - D: To control population growth of certain species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Which of the following is an example of applying the concept of rewilding to restore ecosystems?\n    - A: Creating zoos to conserve endangered species\n    - B: Using abandoned farms to restore ecosystems and reintroduce lost species\n    - C: Implementing strict conservation laws to protect ecosystems\n    - D: Promoting sustainable agriculture practices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is one potential way to promote biodiversity in marine ecosystems?\n    - A: Implementing commercial fishing-free zones\n    - B: Creating artificial reefs\n    - C: Introducing invasive species\n    - D: Reducing marine protected areas\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is a primary cause of ecosystem degradation and megafauna decline?\n    - A: Natural disasters\n    - B: Human activities such as hunting and farming\n    - C: Climate change\n    - D: Invasive species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the potential impact of rewilding on ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity?\n    - A: It can lead to a decrease in biodiversity\n    - B: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - C: It can lead to an increase in biodiversity and promote ecosystem change\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a trophic cascade, and how can it be related to rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: A change in the food chain that has no impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - B: A change at the top of the food chain that affects every level\n    - C: A change in the food chain that only affects certain species\n    - D: A change in the food chain that is only relevant in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Why is it essential to obtain human consent and enthusiasm in rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: To ensure the long-term success and sustainability of rewilding efforts\n    - B: To promote commercial activities in protected areas\n    - C: To control population growth of certain species\n    - D: To reintroduce invasive species into ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the potential benefit of combining the concepts of megafauna, ghost ecosystems, and rewilding?\n    - A: It can help understand the potential for ecosystem restoration\n    - B: It can lead to a decrease in biodiversity\n    - C: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the potential outcome of integrating the idea of trophic cascades with rewilding initiatives?\n    - A: It can lead to a decrease in biodiversity\n    - B: It can have no significant impact on ecosystem dynamics\n    - C: It can promote ecosystem change and increase biodiversity\n    - D: It can only be successful in certain ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 13-17 as they were either similar to previous questions or not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. The refined questions ensure that each question aligns with the key concepts, is clear and concise, and has plausible but incorrect distractors."
