What should they do to minimize their risk of exposure?\n    - A: Handle the element with bare hands\n    - B: Store the element in a sealed container\n    - C: Work with the element in a crowded area\n    - D: Dispose of the element in a regular trash can\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A patient is undergoing radiation therapy for cancer treatment. What is the goal of this treatment?\n    - A: To slow down cell division\n    - B: To kill cancer cells\n    - C: To develop a vaccine\n    - D: To study genetics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the rate of cell division and the effectiveness of radiation therapy?\n    - A: Radiation therapy is more effective on cells that divide slowly\n    - B: Radiation therapy is more effective on cells that divide quickly\n    - C: Radiation therapy has no effect on cell division\n    - D: Radiation therapy only affects healthy cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is fluorine considered relatively safe despite being a reactive element?\n    - A: Because it is a heavy element\n    - B: Because it is a light element\n    - C: Because it is not radioactive\n    - D: Because it is highly toxic\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1) How can the concepts of radioactivity and cell division be combined to understand the effects of radiation on cancer cells?\n    - A: Radiation slows down cell division, making it ineffective against cancer\n    - B: Radiation kills cells, especially those that are dividing, making it effective against cancer\n    - C: Radiation has no effect on cell division, making it useless against cancer\n    - D: Radiation only affects healthy cells, making it ineffective against cancer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What can be inferred about the risks associated with handling different elements based on their reactivity and danger?\n    - A: More reactive elements are always more dangerous\n    - B: Less reactive elements are always more dangerous\n    - C: Heavier elements tend to be more dangerous, regardless of reactivity\n    - D: There is no relationship between reactivity and danger\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1) Justify the use of radiation therapy for cancer treatment. Which of the following statements is a valid justification?\n    - A: Radiation therapy is a cure-all for cancer\n    - B: Radiation therapy is a relatively safe and effective treatment for cancer\n    - C: Radiation therapy is only effective on healthy cells\n    - D: Radiation therapy is too expensive to be a viable treatment option\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Critique the safety protocols used by researchers who handled radium in the past. Which of the following statements is a valid critique?\n    - A: The researchers took adequate precautions to minimize their exposure\n    - B: The researchers did not take adequate precautions to minimize their exposure\n    - C: The researchers were not aware of the risks associated with radium\n    - D: The researchers were not trained to handle radioactive materials\n[Correct answer]: B"
