    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of the cell membrane?\n    - A: To synthesize proteins\n    - B: To store genetic information\n    - C: To regulate what enters and leaves the cell\n    - D: To generate energy for the cell\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which organelle is responsible for modifying and packaging proteins for delivery outside the cell?\n    - A: Endoplasmic reticulum\n    - B: Nucleus\n    - C: Golgi apparatus\n    - D: Lysosomes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the role of the nucleus in protein production?\n    - A: To synthesize proteins directly\n    - B: To provide instructions for protein production through messenger RNA\n    - C: To regulate protein synthesis\n    - D: To store proteins\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How do plant cells generate energy?\n    - A: Through cellular respiration\n    - B: Through photosynthesis\n    - C: Through fermentation\n    - D: Through glycolysis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A person with a compromised immune system is more susceptible to viral infections. What is the primary reason for this?\n    - A: The immune system is unable to produce antibodies\n    - B: The immune system is unable to recognize viral particles\n    - C: The immune system is unable to respond effectively to viral infections\n    - D: The immune system is unable to produce white blood cells\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A person with a mitochondrial disorder may experience fatigue and muscle weakness. Why is this?\n    - A: Mitochondria are responsible for generating energy for the cell\n    - B: Mitochondria are responsible for synthesizing proteins\n    - C: Mitochondria are responsible for regulating cell growth\n    - D: Mitochondria are responsible for storing genetic information\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the main difference between the structure and function of plant and animal cells?\n    - A: Plant cells have a cell wall, while animal cells do not\n    - B: Plant cells have chloroplasts, while animal cells do not\n    - C: Plant cells have a nucleus, while animal cells do not\n    - D: Plant cells have mitochondria, while animal cells do not\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the relationship between the nucleus, ribosomes, and golgi apparatus in protein synthesis?\n    - A: The nucleus provides instructions, ribosomes synthesize proteins, and the golgi apparatus modifies and packages proteins\n    - B: The nucleus synthesizes proteins, ribosomes provide instructions, and the golgi apparatus packages proteins\n    - C: The nucleus packages proteins, ribosomes synthesize proteins, and the golgi apparatus provides instructions\n    - D: The nucleus provides instructions, ribosomes package proteins, and the golgi apparatus synthesizes proteins\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) How do cells work together to maintain overall health?\n    - A: Cells work independently to maintain overall health\n    - B: Cells communicate with each other through signaling pathways\n    - C: Cells work together to maintain homeostasis and respond to external stimuli\n    - D: Cells are only responsible for their own individual functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the role of the immune system in responding to viral infections?\n    - A: The immune system is always able to eliminate viral infections\n    - B: The immune system is able to eliminate most viral infections, but not all\n    - C: The immune system is able to eliminate some viral infections, but not others\n    - D: The immune system is unable to eliminate viral infections\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the impact of environmental factors, such as pollution or climate change, on cellular health?\n    - A: Environmental factors have no impact on cellular health\n    - B: Environmental factors have a minimal impact on cellular health\n    - C: Environmental factors have a significant impact on cellular health\n    - D: Environmental factors are the primary cause of cellular disease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can knowledge of cellular biology be used to develop new treatments or therapies for diseases?\n    - A: By understanding the genetic basis of disease\n    - B: By understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying disease\n    - C: By developing new drugs that target specific cellular pathways\n    - D: By developing new technologies that allow for the manipulation of cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made some minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some of the questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
