A: Beta-amyloid\n    - B: Tau\n    - C: Acetylcholine\n    - D: Dopamine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary effect of the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The disruption of communication between nerve cells\n    - B: The growth of new nerve cells\n    - C: The formation of new memories\n    - D: The increase in cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n4) What is the current status of a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: A cure has been found and is widely available\n    - B: A cure is in the final stages of development and will be available soon\n    - C: A cure has not yet been found, but temporary treatments are available\n    - D: Researchers have stopped searching for a cure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What is one of the primary benefits of understanding the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It enables researchers to develop more effective treatments\n    - B: It allows individuals to seek medical attention and receive timely treatment\n    - C: It helps to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - D: It improves cognitive function in individuals with the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\n6) How can the study of Alzheimer's disease inform the development of treatments for other disorders?\n    - A: By providing insight into the causes and effects of neurodegenerative diseases\n    - B: By identifying potential treatments that can be applied to other diseases\n    - C: By developing new diagnostic tools for other diseases\n    - D: By understanding the genetic factors that contribute to the disease\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the relationship between plaques and tangles in causing Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Plaques and tangles are two separate causes of the disease\n    - B: Plaques cause the disease, while tangles are a secondary effect\n    - C: Tangles cause the disease, while plaques are a secondary effect\n    - D: Plaques and tangles work together to cause the disease\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the impact of Alzheimer's disease on individuals and society?\n    - A: It only affects individuals with the disease\n    - B: It only affects the families of individuals with the disease\n    - C: It has a significant emotional and economic burden on individuals and society\n    - D: It has a minimal impact on individuals and society\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What is the role of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: It is responsible for processing logical thoughts\n    - B: It is responsible for controlling emotions\n    - C: It is responsible for regulating heart rate and breathing\n    - D: It is responsible for forming memories\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: The cost of the treatment\n    - B: The potential side effects of the treatment\n    - C: The impact of the treatment on the progression of the disease\n    - D: The availability of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is the primary consideration when evaluating the potential benefits and risks of new treatments, such as vaccines?\n    - A: The potential for a cure\n    - B: The potential for slowing down the progression of the disease\n    - C: The potential risks and benefits of the treatment\n    - D: The cost of the treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) What is the current focus of researchers in terms of finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease?\n    - A: Developing a vaccine to prevent the disease\n    - B: Developing a treatment to slow down the progression of the disease\n    - C: Understanding the causes and effects of the disease\n    - D: Developing a cure for the disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and accurate.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding a few more questions to cover other important concepts in the transcript, such as:\n\n13) What is the role of beta-amyloid proteins in the formation of plaques in Alzheimer's disease?\n    -
