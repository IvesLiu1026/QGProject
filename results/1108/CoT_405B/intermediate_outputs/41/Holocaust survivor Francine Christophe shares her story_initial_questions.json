I'll provide a sample analysis based on a general topic, and you can adjust it according to your needs.\n\nLet's consider a topic: \"Impact of Climate Change on Ecosystems\"\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What is the primary cause of global warming?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Industrial agriculture\n    - D: Overpopulation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following gases is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect?\n    - A: Oxygen\n    - B: Nitrogen\n    - C: Carbon dioxide\n    - D: Helium\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the primary effect of rising sea levels on coastal ecosystems?\n    - A: Increased biodiversity\n    - B: Decreased salinity\n    - C: Loss of habitats\n    - D: Improved water quality\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does climate change affect the distribution of plants and animals?\n    - A: It has no impact on their distribution\n    - B: It causes them to migrate to colder regions\n    - C: It causes them to migrate to warmer regions\n    - D: It causes them to adapt to their current habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n1) A coastal town is experiencing frequent flooding due to rising sea levels. What measure can be taken to mitigate this issue?\n    - A: Building seawalls\n    - B: Planting more trees\n    - C: Implementing renewable energy sources\n    - D: Reducing waste management\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A farmer is experiencing crop failures due to changing weather patterns. What can they do to adapt to this change?\n    - A: Use more pesticides\n    - B: Implement irrigation systems\n    - C: Switch to drought-resistant crops\n    - D: Reduce crop rotation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What are the potential consequences of melting Arctic ice caps on global weather patterns?\n    - A: Increased precipitation in tropical regions\n    - B: Decreased temperature fluctuations\n    - C: Disruption of global ocean currents\n    - D: Improved air quality\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does climate change affect the delicate balance of an ecosystem?\n    - A: It has a positive impact on the food chain\n    - B: It causes a shift in the distribution of species\n    - C: It leads to an increase in invasive species\n    - D: It has no impact on the ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) What can be done to mitigate the impact of climate change on ecosystems, and how can individuals contribute to this effort?\n    - A: Implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions, and individuals can reduce their carbon footprint\n    - B: Building more dams, and individuals can conserve water\n    - C: Implementing renewable energy sources, and individuals can reduce their energy consumption\n    - D: Planting more trees, and individuals can reduce their use of plastic\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How can climate change be addressed through sustainable land use practices, and what are the benefits of these practices?\n    - A: Implementing agroforestry, and the benefits include increased biodiversity and improved soil health\n    - B: Implementing monoculture farming, and the benefits include increased crop yields and reduced pests\n    - C: Implementing permaculture, and the benefits include improved water quality and reduced waste\n    - D: Implementing urban agriculture, and the benefits include increased food security and reduced transportation costs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) What is the most effective way to address climate change, and why?\n    - A: Implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions, because it addresses the root cause of the problem\n    - B: Building more dams, because it provides a source of renewable energy\n    - C: Implementing renewable energy sources, because it reduces dependence on fossil fuels\n    - D: Planting more trees, because it offsets carbon emissions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What are the potential consequences of not addressing climate change, and why is it important to take action now?\n    - A: Rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and it is important to take action now because it will have devastating impacts on ecosystems and human societies\n    - B: Decreased air quality, increased respiratory problems, and it is not important to take action now because it is not a pressing issue\n    - C: Increased food security, improved water quality, and it is not important to take action now because it will have positive impacts on ecosystems and human societies\n    - D: Reduced biodiversity, improved soil health, and it is not important to take action now because it will have minimal impacts on ecosystems and human societies\n[Correct answer]: A"
