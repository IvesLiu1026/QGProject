However, I can provide you with a general framework for how the multiple-choice questions would be structured using Bloom's Taxonomy levels. I'll create fictional examples based on a hypothetical transcript about a topic, in this case, \"The Impact of Climate Change on Ecosystems.\"\n\n**1. Knowledge**\n\n1) What is the primary cause of the increase in global temperatures over the past century?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Overpopulation\n    - D: Industrial agriculture\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which of the following organizations is responsible for monitoring global climate change?\n    - A: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n    - B: World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\n    - C: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\n    - D: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**2. Comprehension**\n\n1) What is the main effect of climate change on polar bear habitats?\n    - A: Increased availability of food\n    - B: Decreased sea ice coverage\n    - C: Changes in migration patterns\n    - D: Increased risk of disease\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which of the following best describes the concept of ecosystem resilience?\n    - A: The ability of an ecosystem to recover from disturbances\n    - B: The ability of an ecosystem to adapt to changing conditions\n    - C: The ability of an ecosystem to resist invasive species\n    - D: The ability of an ecosystem to maintain biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**3. Application**\n\n1) A local government is planning to develop a new coastal area for tourism. What should they consider to mitigate the impacts of climate change?\n    - A: Building seawalls to protect against sea-level rise\n    - B: Implementing sustainable fishing practices\n    - C: Creating a marine protected area\n    - D: Increasing the number of hotels and resorts\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A farmer is experiencing decreased crop yields due to changing weather patterns. What could they do to adapt to these changes?\n    - A: Plant drought-resistant crops\n    - B: Increase irrigation\n    - C: Use more fertilizers\n    - D: Switch to a different type of crop\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**4. Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between ocean acidification and coral bleaching?\n    - A: Ocean acidification causes coral bleaching\n    - B: Coral bleaching causes ocean acidification\n    - C: Both are caused by climate change, but are unrelated\n    - D: Neither is related to climate change\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How do changes in precipitation patterns affect the distribution of plant species?\n    - A: Increased precipitation leads to increased plant growth\n    - B: Decreased precipitation leads to decreased plant growth\n    - C: Changes in precipitation patterns lead to shifts in plant distribution\n    - D: Precipitation patterns have no effect on plant distribution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**5. Synthesis**\n\n1) What could be a potential solution to the problem of sea-level rise in coastal cities?\n    - A: Building floating cities\n    - B: Implementing green infrastructure\n    - C: Creating sea walls\n    - D: Relocating cities inland\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How could climate change mitigation efforts be integrated into urban planning?\n    - A: By increasing the number of parks and green spaces\n    - B: By implementing renewable energy sources\n    - C: By designing cities with green infrastructure\n    - D: By increasing the number of roads and highways\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**6. Evaluation**\n\n1) What is a limitation of using carbon offsetting as a climate change mitigation strategy?\n    - A: It is too expensive\n    - B: It is not effective in reducing emissions\n    - C: It can lead to greenwashing\n    - D: It is not widely available\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can the effectiveness of climate change policies be evaluated?\n    - A: By measuring the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: By assessing the economic impacts of the policies\n    - C: By evaluating the social and environmental co-benefits\n    - D: By comparing the policies to a baseline scenario\n[Correct answer]: A"
