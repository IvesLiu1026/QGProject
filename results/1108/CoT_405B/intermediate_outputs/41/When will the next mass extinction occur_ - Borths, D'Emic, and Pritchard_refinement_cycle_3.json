    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how large was the asteroid that struck the Earth 66 million years ago?\n    - A: The size of a small island\n    - B: Roughly the size of Manhattan\n    - C: The size of a large mountain range\n    - D: The size of a small continent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of species went extinct during the largest mass extinction event 252 million years ago?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 75%\n    - C: 95%\n    - D: 100%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What are some common causes of mass extinctions, according to the fossil record and geological evidence?\n    - A: Only asteroid impacts\n    - B: Only volcanic eruptions\n    - C: Various factors, including volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the climate\n    - D: Only changes in ocean currents\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How is the Earth's history divided, based on the fossil record and mass extinctions?\n    - A: Into distinct periods based on the emergence of new species\n    - B: Into distinct periods based on mass extinctions\n    - C: Into continuous and uninterrupted processes\n    - D: Only influenced by human activity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential benefit of studying past extinction events?\n    - A: Understanding the evolution of new species\n    - B: Recognizing what is happening today as environments change and using this knowledge to prevent future extinctions\n    - C: Predicting the emergence of new diseases\n    - D: Understanding the Earth's geological processes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the relationship between the fluctuation of massive ice sheets and the extinction of large mammals?\n    - A: The fluctuation of massive ice sheets has no impact on the extinction of large mammals\n    - B: The fluctuation of massive ice sheets is the sole cause of the extinction of large mammals\n    - C: The fluctuation of massive ice sheets is one of the factors that contributed to the extinction of large mammals\n    - D: The extinction of large mammals is only caused by human activity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the current rate of extinction compare to the natural background rate?\n    - A: The current rate of extinction is lower than the natural background rate\n    - B: The current rate of extinction is the same as the natural background rate\n    - C: The current rate of extinction is hundreds to thousands of times higher than the natural background rate\n    - D: The current rate of extinction is only slightly higher than the natural background rate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a potential outcome of combining the knowledge of past extinction events with the current state of the environment?\n    - A: Predicting the emergence of new diseases\n    - B: Predicting and preventing future mass extinctions by taking steps to mitigate our impact on the environment\n    - C: Understanding the evolution of new species\n    - D: Understanding the Earth's geological processes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a comprehensive approach to addressing the current rate of extinction and mitigating the effects of climate change?\n    - A: Only reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Only conserving natural habitats\n    - C: Taking a multi-faceted approach that includes reducing our impact on the environment, conserving natural habitats, and protecting endangered species\n    - D: Only protecting endangered species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) Why is immediate action necessary to address the current rate of extinction?\n    - A: The current rate of extinction is lower than the natural background rate\n    - B: The current rate of extinction is the same as the natural background rate\n    - C: The current rate of extinction is significantly higher than the natural background rate, threatening the survival of many species\n    - D: The current rate of extinction is only slightly higher than the natural background rate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the potential role of humans in the extinction of large mammals?\n    - A: Humans had no impact on the extinction of large mammals\n    - B: Humans were the sole cause of the extinction of large mammals\n    - C: Humans may have contributed to the extinction of large mammals, but it is not clear if they were the sole cause\n    - D: Humans only protected endangered species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 12-16 as they were redundant or similar to other questions. The refined questions are clear, concise, and align with the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No more refinement needed."
