The massive extinction event that occurred 66 million years ago was caused by massive volcanic eruptions and an asteroid impact.\n2. The asteroid was roughly the size of Manhattan.\n3. The event led to the extinction of three-quarters of the world's species, including dinosaurs, pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles.\n4. The largest mass extinction event occurred 252 million years ago, between the Permian and Triassic periods.\n5. The Earth's land masses gathered together into the single supercontinent Pangaea during this time.\n6. The event led to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean and on land.\n7. The fluctuation of massive ice sheets at the planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall over the last few million years.\n8. The extinction of large mammals, such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths, coincides with changes in the climate and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. Mass extinctions are rare events that occur when the environment changes too quickly for most living creatures to adapt.\n2. These events can be caused by various factors, including volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the climate.\n3. The fossil record shows dramatic changes in the lineages of species that persisted through several geological layers, indicating mass extinctions.\n4. The Earth's history can be divided into distinct periods based on these mass extinctions.\n5. Humans may have contributed to the extinction of large mammals, but it is not clear if they were the sole cause.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. Understanding past extinction events can help us recognize what is happening today as environments change.\n2. By learning from past events, we can take steps to lessen our impact on other species and prevent future mass extinctions.\n3. The same unique ability that makes humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them.\n4. Recognizing the signs of mass extinctions, such as changes in the climate and ecosystem, can help us take action to prevent them.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The relationship between the asteroid impact and the extinction of species 66 million years ago.\n2. The contrast between the Permian and Triassic periods, and the changes that occurred during this time.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the fluctuation of massive ice sheets and the extinction of large mammals.\n4. The comparison between the natural rate of extinction and the current rate, which is hundreds to thousands of times higher.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. Combining the knowledge of past extinction events with the current state of the environment to predict future mass extinctions.\n2. Integrating the understanding of human impact on the environment with the ability to prevent mass extinctions.\n3. Recognizing the interconnectedness of species and ecosystems, and how changes in one area can affect others.\n4. Developing strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change and prevent future mass extinctions.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Judging the impact of human activity on the environment and its contribution to mass extinctions.\n2. Evaluating the effectiveness of current conservation efforts and strategies to prevent mass extinctions.\n3. Justifying the need for immediate action to address the current rate of extinction, which is higher than the natural background rate.\n4. Critiquing the role of humans in the extinction of large mammals and the potential for future extinctions."
