    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge:**\n\n1. The speaker teaches high school math and has been doing so for six years.\n2. The speaker breaks down math into two categories: computation and math reasoning.\n3. Computation is the process of solving math problems using formulas and procedures.\n4. Math reasoning is the application of math processes to the world around us.\n5. The speaker mentions that students in the US are not retaining math reasoning skills.\n6. The speaker quotes David Milch, a TV show creator, who talks about the importance of patient problem-solving.\n7. The speaker mentions that textbooks, particularly mass-adopted textbooks, are not effective in teaching math reasoning.\n8. The speaker shows an example from a physics textbook that demonstrates how it hampers patient problem-solving.\n\n**Comprehension:**\n\n1. The speaker is frustrated with the current state of math education in the US, which focuses on computation rather than math reasoning.\n2. The speaker believes that math reasoning is essential for problem-solving in real life.\n3. The speaker thinks that the way math is taught in the US is \"functionally equivalent to turning on Two and a Half Men and calling it a day.\"\n4. The speaker argues that students are not learning patient problem-solving skills because they are not being taught to think critically.\n5. The speaker believes that math education should focus on developing students' intuition and critical thinking skills.\n\n**Application:**\n\n1. The speaker suggests that teachers should use real-world examples to teach math concepts.\n2. The speaker recommends using multimedia resources, such as videos and images, to bring real-world problems into the classroom.\n3. The speaker encourages teachers to ask open-ended questions that allow students to think critically and develop their own solutions.\n4. The speaker suggests that teachers should be \"less helpful\" and allow students to struggle with problems in order to develop patient problem-solving skills.\n5. The speaker believes that math education should be more focused on developing students' critical thinking skills, rather than just teaching formulas and procedures.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The speaker identifies a problem with the way math is taught in the US, which focuses on computation rather than math reasoning.\n2. The speaker analyzes the consequences of this approach, including students' lack of retention and inability to apply math concepts to real-world problems.\n3. The speaker compares the current state of math education to a TV show that is not challenging or engaging.\n4. The speaker argues that the way math is taught in the US is not effective in preparing students for real-world problems.\n5. The speaker identifies the importance of developing students' intuition and critical thinking skills in math education.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. The speaker combines the ideas of math reasoning and patient problem-solving to create a new approach to math education.\n2. The speaker suggests that teachers should use a combination of real-world examples, multimedia resources, and open-ended questions to teach math concepts.\n3. The speaker encourages teachers to think creatively about how to teach math concepts in a way that develops students' critical thinking skills.\n4. The speaker believes that math education should be more focused on developing students' intuition and critical thinking skills, rather than just teaching formulas and procedures.\n5. The speaker argues that the current state of math education is not effective in preparing students for real-world problems, and that a new approach is needed.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. The speaker critiques the current state of math education in the US, arguing that it is not effective in preparing students for real-world problems.\n2. The speaker evaluates the consequences of the current approach to math education, including students' lack of retention and inability to apply math concepts to real-world problems.\n3. The speaker argues that the way math is taught in the US is not challenging or engaging, and that a new approach is needed.\n4. The speaker believes that math education should be more focused on developing students' critical thinking skills, rather than just teaching formulas and procedures.\n5. The speaker encourages teachers and policymakers to think critically about the current state of math education and to consider new approaches that focus on developing students' intuition and critical thinking skills."
