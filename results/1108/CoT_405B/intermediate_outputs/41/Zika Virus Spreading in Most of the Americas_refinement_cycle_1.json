Based on the information available, here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of the increase in global temperatures over the past century?\n    - A: Burning of fossil fuels\n    - B: Deforestation and land-use changes\n    - C: Overpopulation and consumption patterns\n    - D: Industrial agriculture and food production\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which international organization is responsible for assessing the science and impacts of global climate change?\n    - A: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n    - B: World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\n    - C: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\n    - D: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the main effect of climate change on polar bear habitats?\n    - A: Increased availability of food sources\n    - B: Decreased sea ice coverage and habitat loss\n    - C: Changes in migration patterns and behavior\n    - D: Increased risk of disease and human conflict\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is ecosystem resilience in the context of climate change?\n    - A: The ability of an ecosystem to recover from disturbances and adapt to changing conditions\n    - B: The ability of an ecosystem to resist invasive species and maintain biodiversity\n    - C: The ability of an ecosystem to maintain its current state and function\n    - D: The ability of an ecosystem to undergo rapid changes and transformations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) A local government is planning to develop a new coastal area for tourism. What should they consider to mitigate the impacts of climate change?\n    - A: Building seawalls and coastal protection structures\n    - B: Implementing sustainable fishing and tourism practices\n    - C: Creating a marine protected area and conserving natural habitats\n    - D: Increasing the number of hotels and resorts with minimal environmental regulations\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) A farmer is experiencing decreased crop yields due to changing weather patterns. What could they do to adapt to these changes?\n    - A: Plant drought-resistant crops and implement climate-resilient agricultural practices\n    - B: Increase irrigation and water usage\n    - C: Use more fertilizers and pesticides\n    - D: Switch to a different type of crop without considering climate resilience\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between ocean acidification and coral bleaching?\n    - A: Ocean acidification contributes to coral bleaching and reef degradation\n    - B: Coral bleaching causes ocean acidification and changes in ocean chemistry\n    - C: Both are caused by climate change, but are unrelated and separate impacts\n    - D: Neither is related to climate change or human activities\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How do changes in precipitation patterns affect the distribution of plant species?\n    - A: Increased precipitation leads to increased plant growth and abundance\n    - B: Decreased precipitation leads to decreased plant growth and abundance\n    - C: Changes in precipitation patterns lead to shifts in plant distribution and community composition\n    - D: Precipitation patterns have no effect on plant distribution and ecology\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What could be a potential solution to the problem of sea-level rise in coastal cities?\n    - A: Building floating cities and offshore infrastructure\n    - B: Implementing green infrastructure and nature-based solutions\n    - C: Creating sea walls and coastal protection structures\n    - D: Relocating cities inland and abandoning coastal areas\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How could climate change mitigation efforts be integrated into urban planning?\n    - A: By increasing the number of parks and green spaces\n    - B: By implementing renewable energy sources and reducing energy consumption\n    - C: By designing cities with green infrastructure and climate-resilient systems\n    - D: By increasing the number of roads and highways with minimal environmental regulations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a limitation of using carbon offsetting as a climate change mitigation strategy?\n    - A: It is too expensive and not economically viable\n    - B: It is not effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: It can lead to greenwashing and lack of transparency\n    - D: It is not widely available and not well-developed\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of climate change policies be evaluated?\n    - A: By measuring the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts\n    - B: By assessing the economic impacts and costs of the policies\n    - C: By evaluating the social and environmental co-benefits and synergies\n    - D: By comparing the policies to a baseline scenario and business-as-usual approach\n[Correct answer]: A"
