    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, have plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two categories of math that the speaker breaks down math into?\n    - A: Computation and algebra\n    - B: Computation and math reasoning\n    - C: Math reasoning and geometry\n    - D: Algebra and geometry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who does the speaker quote to emphasize the importance of patient problem-solving in the context of TV shows?\n    - A: David Milch, a mathematician\n    - B: David Milch, a TV show creator\n    - C: Albert Einstein, a physicist\n    - D: Isaac Newton, a mathematician\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the speaker's main concern with the current state of math education in the US?\n    - A: That it focuses too much on math reasoning\n    - B: That it focuses too much on computation and doesn't prepare students for real-world problems\n    - C: That it does not use enough textbooks\n    - D: That it does not use enough technology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What does the speaker believe is essential for problem-solving in real life?\n    - A: Computation skills\n    - B: Math reasoning skills\n    - C: Algebra skills\n    - D: Geometry skills\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What does the speaker suggest teachers use to bring real-world problems into the classroom?\n    - A: Textbooks and worksheets\n    - B: Videos, images, and real-world examples\n    - C: Calculators and computers\n    - D: Pencils and paper\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the speaker suggest teachers should approach helping students with problems?\n    - A: By giving them the answers\n    - B: By providing step-by-step instructions\n    - C: By being \"less helpful\" and allowing students to struggle and develop problem-solving skills\n    - D: By ignoring them\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What does the speaker compare the current state of math education to?\n    - A: A challenging and engaging TV show\n    - B: A boring and unchallenging TV show, such as a sitcom\n    - C: A difficult and complex math problem\n    - D: A simple and easy math problem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What does the speaker argue is a consequence of the current approach to math education?\n    - A: Students are retaining math concepts well\n    - B: Students are able to apply math concepts to real-world problems\n    - C: Students are not retaining math concepts well and lack problem-solving skills\n    - D: Students are not interested in math\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What does the speaker suggest combining to create a new approach to math education?\n    - A: Computation and algebra\n    - B: Math reasoning and patient problem-solving\n    - C: Textbooks and technology\n    - D: Calculators and computers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What does the speaker encourage teachers to do when teaching math concepts?\n    - A: Use a combination of real-world examples, multimedia resources, and open-ended questions\n    - B: Use only textbooks and worksheets\n    - C: Use only calculators and computers\n    - D: Use only pencils and paper\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What does the speaker critique about the current state of math education in the US?\n    - A: That it is too challenging and engaging\n    - B: That it is not effective in preparing students for real-world problems\n    - C: That it focuses too much on math reasoning\n    - D: That it does not use enough textbooks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What does the speaker believe math education should focus on developing in students?\n    - A: Only computation skills\n    - B: Only math reasoning skills\n    - C: Critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and the ability to apply math concepts to real-world problems\n    - D: Only algebra skills\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some of the questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
