    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) What is the condition called when internal organs are flipped, which can be harmless or fatal?\n    - A: Situs asymmetrus\n    - B: Situs inversus\n    - C: Organum inversum\n    - D: Asymmetria fatalis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the difference in the number of lobes between the left and right lungs?\n    - A: The left lung has 3 lobes, and the right lung has 2 lobes.\n    - B: The left lung has 2 lobes, and the right lung has 3 lobes.\n    - C: Both lungs have 2 lobes.\n    - D: Both lungs have 3 lobes.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the relationship between the appearance of the human body and its internal features?\n    - A: The human body appears asymmetrical on the outside and symmetrical on the inside.\n    - B: The human body appears symmetrical on the outside and asymmetrical on the inside.\n    - C: The human body appears symmetrical on both the outside and inside.\n    - D: The human body appears asymmetrical on both the outside and inside.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is chirality, and how does it contribute to the properties of biomolecules?\n    - A: Chirality is a property of biomolecules that contributes to their symmetry.\n    - B: Chirality is a property of biomolecules that contributes to their asymmetry.\n    - C: Chirality is a property of cells that determines their shape.\n    - D: Chirality is a property of biomolecules that determines their function.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) This question is removed as it is a duplicate of question 4.\n\n6) No question was provided.\n\n7) What is the relationship between symmetry and asymmetry in nature?\n    - A: Symmetry is more important than asymmetry in nature.\n    - B: Asymmetry is more important than symmetry in nature.\n    - C: Both symmetry and asymmetry are important in nature.\n    - D: Symmetry and asymmetry are mutually exclusive in nature.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the node, cilia, and gene activation in embryo development?\n    - A: The node's cilia sense fluid flow, which activates genes on the right side of the embryo.\n    - B: The node's cilia sense fluid flow, which activates genes on the left side of the embryo.\n    - C: The node's cilia sense fluid flow, which inhibits gene activation on the left side of the embryo.\n    - D: The node's cilia do not sense fluid flow, and gene activation occurs randomly.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can integrating the concepts of symmetry and asymmetry help us understand natural forms?\n    - A: By recognizing the importance of symmetry in nature\n    - B: By recognizing the importance of asymmetry in nature\n    - C: By recognizing the interplay between symmetry and asymmetry in nature\n    - D: By ignoring the role of asymmetry in nature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is the benefit of considering both symmetry and asymmetry when studying natural forms?\n    - A: It highlights the importance of symmetry in nature.\n    - B: It highlights the importance of asymmetry in nature.\n    - C: It reveals the complex relationships between symmetry and asymmetry in nature.\n    - D: It shows that asymmetry is irrelevant in nature.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What can be gained by combining knowledge of embryonic development with an appreciation for the beauty of asymmetry?\n    - A: A deeper understanding of the importance of symmetry in nature\n    - B: A deeper understanding of the complexity and diversity of natural forms\n    - C: A greater appreciation for the beauty of symmetry\n    - D: A greater appreciation for the simplicity of natural forms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What can be said about the significance of asymmetry in nature and its impact on our understanding of the world?\n    - A: Asymmetry is insignificant in nature and has no impact on our understanding of the world.\n    - B: Asymmetry is significant in nature, but its impact on our understanding of the world is minimal.\n    - C: Asymmetry is significant in nature and has a profound impact on our understanding of the world.\n    - D: Asymmetry is more significant than symmetry in nature and has a greater impact on our understanding of the world.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) How can one critique the idea that symmetry is inherently more beautiful or desirable than asymmetry?\n    - A: By arguing that symmetry is more common in nature\n    - B: By arguing that asymmetry is more common in nature\n    - C: By recognizing the beauty and importance of asymmetry in nature\n    - D: By ignoring the role of asymmetry in nature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-13."
