    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Recall facts or details):\n1. The expedition is at the heart of an ancient temple in The Lost City.\n2. There are eight graduate students and one leader in the expedition.\n3. Two students bump into the altar, triggering green smoke and a curse.\n4. The curse causes two students to be possessed by the spirits of the city's King and Queen.\n5. The possessed students may lie or tell the truth at any time.\n6. The temple will collapse in less than an hour, and the group needs to escape.\n7. The group has five hallways to choose from, including the one to the altar and the one leading outside.\n8. It would take about 20 minutes to reach the exit at a fast pace.\n\n**Comprehension** (Summarize important concepts):\n1. The group needs to find a way to escape the temple before it collapses.\n2. The curse affects the communication of the two possessed students, but not their behavior.\n3. The leader knows they are not possessed and can explore one hallway alone.\n4. The group needs to figure out which hallway leads to the exit without knowing who to trust.\n\n**Application** (Real-world applications):\n1. This scenario can be applied to real-world situations where a group needs to make a decision with incomplete or unreliable information.\n2. The strategy used to solve this problem can be applied to other situations where there are multiple options and uncertain outcomes.\n\n**Analysis** (Relationships, contrasts, or cause-and-effect connections):\n1. The relationship between the number of students in each group and the reliability of their reports.\n2. The contrast between the possessed students' behavior and the behavior of the other students.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the curse and the possessed students' communication.\n\n**Synthesis** (Combine ideas to form new understanding):\n1. Combining the idea of splitting the students into groups with the idea of using the process of elimination to figure out which hallway leads to the exit.\n2. Combining the idea of trusting the majority in each trio with the idea of ignoring the duo if they are arguing.\n\n**Evaluation** (Judgment, critique, or justification):\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of the strategy used to solve the problem.\n2. Critiquing the leader's decision to split the students into groups and explore the hallways.\n3. Justifying the use of the process of elimination to figure out which hallway leads to the exit."
