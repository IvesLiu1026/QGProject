    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What pigment is primarily responsible for giving skin and hair its color?\n    - A: Carotene\n    - B: Melanin\n    - C: Rhodopsin\n    - D: Keratin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of cancer can form in the skin's melanocytes due to severe UV damage?\n    - A: Leukemia\n    - B: Melanoma\n    - C: Carcinoma\n    - D: Lymphoma\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why did humans living near the Equator adapt to have higher melanin production and darker skin tones?\n    - A: To protect against vitamin D deficiency\n    - B: To protect against melanoma\n    - C: To adapt to cold climates\n    - D: To adapt to high altitudes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to skin color as humans migrate northward, away from the Equator?\n    - A: It becomes darker\n    - B: It remains the same\n    - C: It becomes lighter\n    - D: It becomes more sensitive to UV light\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What is a common method used today to protect oneself against UV light damage?\n    - A: Using sunscreen\n    - B: Wearing dark clothing\n    - C: Staying indoors during the day\n    - D: Avoiding vitamin D supplements\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is the role of UV light in vitamin D production?\n    - A: UV light decreases vitamin D production\n    - B: UV light has no effect on vitamin D production\n    - C: UV light increases vitamin D production\n    - D: UV light only affects melanin production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) Why is it essential to maintain adequate levels of vitamin D?\n    - A: To prevent melanoma\n    - B: To protect against UV light damage\n    - C: To maintain bone strength and mineral absorption\n    - D: To reduce the risk of heart disease\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between UV light exposure and melanin production?\n    - A: UV light exposure decreases melanin production\n    - B: UV light exposure has no effect on melanin production\n    - C: UV light exposure increases melanin production\n    - D: UV light exposure only affects vitamin D production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What are the contrasting effects of UV light exposure on human health?\n    - A: Benefits: vitamin D production; drawbacks: skin damage and melanoma\n    - B: Benefits: skin damage and melanoma; drawbacks: vitamin D production\n    - C: Benefits: UV light exposure has no benefits; drawbacks: skin damage and melanoma\n    - D: Benefits: vitamin D production; drawbacks: none\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can be inferred about the relationship between skin color and character?\n    - A: Skin color reflects a person's character\n    - B: Skin color has no relation to a person's character\n    - C: Skin color determines a person's intelligence\n    - D: Skin color affects a person's behavior\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What can be reconstructed by integrating the understanding of skin color adaptation with knowledge of human migration patterns?\n    - A: The history of human evolution\n    - B: The migration patterns of early humans\n    - C: The development of melanoma\n    - D: The discovery of vitamin D\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is the implication of the statement \"skin color is little more than an adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun\" on societal attitudes towards skin color?\n    - A: It promotes racism and discrimination\n    - B: It challenges social and cultural biases associated with skin color\n    - C: It has no impact on societal attitudes\n    - D: It reinforces the importance of skin color in human evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) Why is vitamin D essential for human health, regardless of skin tone or sun exposure?\n    - A: Vitamin D is essential for bone strength and mineral absorption\n    - B: Vitamin D is only important for individuals with dark skin tones\n    - C: Vitamin D is not essential for human health\n    - D: Vitamin D is only important for individuals with light skin tones\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 6 (initial), 10 (initial), 11 (initial), and 14, as they were redundant or not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also rephrased some questions to enhance clarity and conciseness. The distractors were reviewed to ensure they are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers were verified for accuracy."
