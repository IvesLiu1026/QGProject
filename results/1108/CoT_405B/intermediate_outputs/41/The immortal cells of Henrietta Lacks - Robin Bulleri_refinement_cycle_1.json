    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In what year were HeLa cells first discovered?\n    - A: 1940\n    - B: 1951\n    - C: 1960\n    - D: 1970\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many chromosomes do HeLa cells have?\n    - A: 23\n    - B: 46\n    - C: 80\n    - D: 100\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why do scientists grow human cells in labs?\n    - A: To study the structure of cells\n    - B: To understand how diseases develop and test new treatments\n    - C: To study the behavior of cells in different environments\n    - D: To develop new medicines\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What makes HeLa cells unique compared to other cell lines?\n    - A: They are the only cells that can divide indefinitely\n    - B: They can survive and divide outside the human body for an extended period\n    - C: They are the only cells that can be used to study cancer\n    - D: They are the only cells that can be used to test new treatments\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one significant contribution of HeLa cells to scientific research?\n    - A: They helped develop a vaccine for the polio epidemic\n    - B: They were used to study the effects of climate change on human cells\n    - C: They were used to develop new medicines\n    - D: They were used to study the behavior of cells in different environments\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can the study of HeLa cells help scientists understand cancer?\n    - A: By studying the structure of cancer cells\n    - B: By understanding how cancer cells develop and evade destruction\n    - C: By studying the behavior of cancer cells in different environments\n    - D: By developing new medicines to treat cancer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is one key difference between HeLa cells and normal human cells?\n    - A: HeLa cells are smaller than normal human cells\n    - B: HeLa cells have a limited lifespan, whereas normal human cells are immortal\n    - C: HeLa cells are immortal, whereas normal human cells have a limited lifespan\n    - D: HeLa cells have more chromosomes than normal human cells\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between HeLa cells and cancer research?\n    - A: HeLa cells have been used to study the development of cancer\n    - B: HeLa cells have been used to study the treatment of cancer\n    - C: HeLa cells have been used to study both the development and treatment of cancer\n    - D: HeLa cells have not been used to study cancer\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is one potential benefit of combining HeLa cells with genetic research?\n    - A: A better understanding of the genetic basis of cancer\n    - B: A better understanding of the structure of cells\n    - C: A better understanding of the behavior of cells in different environments\n    - D: A better understanding of how to develop new medicines\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What is one potential outcome of using HeLa cells in conjunction with other scientific techniques?\n    - A: A greater understanding of the complex relationships between cells, genetics, and disease\n    - B: A greater understanding of the structure of cells\n    - C: A greater understanding of the behavior of cells in different environments\n    - D: A greater understanding of how to develop new medicines\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is one ethical concern surrounding the use of HeLa cells?\n    - A: The potential risks and consequences of using HeLa cells\n    - B: The ownership and control of human tissue\n    - C: The responsible use of knowledge gained from HeLa cells\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is one consideration that must be taken into account when evaluating the use of HeLa cells for scientific research?\n    - A: The potential benefits of using HeLa cells\n    - B: The potential risks and consequences of using HeLa cells\n    - C: The ethical implications of using HeLa cells\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor adjustments to ensure the questions are clear and concise, and the distractors are plausible but incorrect. No significant changes were necessary, so the refined questions are similar to the initial set."
