    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Approximately how many people and their families are affected by cancer worldwide at any given time?\n    - A: 10 million\n    - B: 14 million\n    - C: 20 million\n    - D: 25 million\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the estimated number of different types of cancer?\n    - A: 50\n    - B: 75\n    - C: 100\n    - D: 150\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why is cancer a complex disease that is difficult to cure?\n    - A: Due to its single form and inability to adapt\n    - B: Due to its many forms and ability to adapt\n    - C: Due to its slow growth rate\n    - D: Due to its limited impact on the body\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to normal cells when they detect mutations or DNA damage?\n    - A: They become cancerous\n    - B: They fix the mutations or self-destruct\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They multiply rapidly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is necessary to develop new, more effective treatments for cancer?\n    - A: Understanding the simplicity of the disease\n    - B: Understanding the complexities of the disease\n    - C: Ignoring the complexities of the disease\n    - D: Focusing solely on surgery as a treatment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What could be a potential benefit of targeting cancer stem cells?\n    - A: It could lead to the growth of new tumors\n    - B: It could help prevent cancers from coming back\n    - C: It could have no impact on cancer treatment\n    - D: It could only be effective in combination with surgery\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What makes cancer cells resistant to treatment?\n    - A: Their inability to adapt and evolve\n    - B: Their ability to adapt and evolve\n    - C: Their slow growth rate\n    - D: Their limited impact on the body\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can be a result of the interaction between cancer cells and the immune system?\n    - A: The immune system's function is enhanced\n    - B: The immune system's function is suppressed\n    - C: The immune system is unaffected\n    - D: The cancer cells are immediately destroyed\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What could be a potential benefit of understanding the complex ecosystem of cancer cells?\n    - A: It could lead to a single, universal treatment for cancer\n    - B: It could lead to new treatment strategies\n    - C: It could have no impact on cancer treatment\n    - D: It could only be effective in combination with radiation therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What could be a potential benefit of developing treatments that target multiple subclones of cancer cells?\n    - A: It could be less effective than targeting a single subclone\n    - B: It could be more effective than targeting a single subclone\n    - C: It could have no impact on cancer treatment\n    - D: It could only be effective in combination with surgery\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) Why is it necessary to continue researching and funding new treatments for cancer?\n    - A: Because current treatments are completely effective\n    - B: Because current treatments have some limitations and there is room for improvement\n    - C: Because cancer is a rare disease\n    - D: Because cancer only affects a small number of people\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What has been the trend in the average mortality rate for most kinds of cancer since the 1970s?\n    - A: It has increased significantly\n    - B: It has remained the same\n    - C: It has dropped significantly\n    - D: It has fluctuated randomly\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed question 11 from the initial set and replaced it with a new question 11, and also modified question 12 to better align with the transcript. No further refinement is needed for the remaining questions."
