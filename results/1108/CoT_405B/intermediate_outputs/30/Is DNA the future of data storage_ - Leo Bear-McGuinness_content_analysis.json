    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) stores biological information.\n2. DNA is composed of four organic bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\n3. Codons are groups of three DNA bases that provide instructions for protein production.\n4. In 1999, scientists created an alphabet using DNA codons to represent letters, numbers, and grammar symbols.\n5. In 2012, UK scientists encoded 739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands.\n6. The theoretical limit of DNA's storage capacity is approximately 100 million HD movies on a pencil eraser.\n7. DNA has a half-life of 500 years.\n8. Conan the Bacterium is a microbe that can survive in extreme conditions.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. DNA can be used to store non-biological information, such as text and digital data.\n2. The sequence of DNA bases determines the instructions for protein production.\n3. DNA cryptography involves encoding and decoding messages using DNA codons.\n4. Synthetic DNA can be used to store large amounts of digital data.\n5. DNA has a longer lifespan than traditional storage methods, such as magnetic tape and discs.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1.

The connection between DNA's lifespan and its potential for long-term information preservation.\n4. The implications of using DNA storage on the preservation of human knowledge and legacy.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Integrating DNA storage with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to create advanced knowledge archives.\n2. Developing methods for automating the encoding and decoding of information stored in DNA.\n3. Exploring the potential for using DNA storage in space exploration and colonization.\n4. Considering the ethical implications of using DNA storage for preserving human knowledge and legacy.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1. Assessing the feasibility and practicality of using DNA storage for large-scale information preservation.\n2. Evaluating the potential risks and challenges associated with using DNA storage, such as data degradation and contamination.\n3. Critiquing the idea of using microorganisms like Conan the Bacterium for storing and preserving information.\n4. Justifying the importance of preserving human knowledge and legacy through DNA storage and other means."
