    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) When do horseshoe crabs typically emerge from the sea to spawn?\n    - A: During the full moon in colder months\n    - B: At night during the full moon in warmer months\n    - C: During the day in warmer months\n    - D: At night during the new moon in warmer months\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary purpose of the LAL test in the medical industry?\n    - A: To detect viral infections in medical devices and medicines\n    - B: To detect endotoxins in medical devices and medicines\n    - C: To detect bacterial infections in medical devices and medicines\n    - D: To detect fungal infections in medical devices and medicines\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is horseshoe crab blood harvested for medical use?\n    - A: Because it contains cells that protect them from infection\n    - B: Because it is rich in oxygen\n    - C: Because it is rich in nutrients\n    - D: Because it has a highly developed immune system similar to humans\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What makes horseshoe crabs vulnerable to bacterial infections?\n    - A: Their closed circulatory system and clean habitats\n    - B: Their open circulatory system and bacteria-filled habitats\n    - C: Their highly developed immune system and clean habitats\n    - D: Their poorly developed immune system and clean habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How is the LAL test used in the medical industry?\n    - A: To ensure the safety of medical devices and medicines by detecting endotoxins\n    - B: To develop new medicines for bacterial infections\n    - C: To test the efficacy of new medical devices\n    - D: To monitor the health of patients with bacterial infections\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is a potential solution to reduce the demand for live horseshoe crabs in the biomedical industry?\n    - A: Developing new medicines that don't require horseshoe crab blood\n    - B: Synthesizing horseshoe crab blood in the lab\n    - C: Reducing the use of medical devices that require LAL testing\n    - D: Increasing conservation efforts for horseshoe crab populations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between horseshoe crab blood and the LAL test?\n    - A: The blood is used to produce a vaccine against bacterial infections\n    - B: The blood is used to produce the LAL extract, which detects endotoxins\n    - C: The blood is used to develop new medicines for bacterial infections\n    - D: The blood is used to monitor the health of patients with bacterial infections\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect relationship between the biomedical industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood and the decline of their populations?\n    - A: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has led to an increase in their populations\n    - B: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has no impact on their populations\n    - C: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has led to a decline in their populations\n    - D: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has led to a stabilization of their populations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What makes horseshoe crab blood an important resource for the medical industry?\n    - A: Its high oxygen content and ability to detect viruses\n    - B: Its unique characteristics and highly sensitive immune response\n    - C: Its ability to detect bacteria and high nutrient content\n    - D: Its ability to detect fungal infections and high oxygen content\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What has led to the development of the LAL test?\n    - A: The combination of horseshoe crabs' vulnerability to viral infections and their highly sensitive immune response\n    - B: The combination of horseshoe crabs' vulnerability to bacterial infections and their highly sensitive immune response\n    - C: The combination of horseshoe crabs' highly developed immune system and their clean habitats\n    - D: The combination of horseshoe crabs' poorly developed immune system and their bacteria-filled habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for the remaining questions as they were removed due to being subjective and open to interpretation."
