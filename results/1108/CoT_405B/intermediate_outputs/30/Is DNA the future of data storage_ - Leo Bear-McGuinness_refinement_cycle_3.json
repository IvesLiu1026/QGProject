    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary function of DNA in living organisms?\n    - A: To regulate cell growth and division\n    - B: To produce proteins and enzymes\n    - C: To respond to environmental stimuli\n    - D: To store and transmit genetic information\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What are the four organic bases that make up DNA?\n    - A: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Uracil\n    - B: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine\n    - C: Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Uracil\n    - D: Cytosine, Guanine, Adenine, and Uracil\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the significance of the sequence of DNA bases?\n    - A: It determines the structure of the DNA molecule\n    - B: It determines the rate of cell division\n    - C: It determines the response to environmental stimuli\n    - D: It provides instructions for protein production\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What is DNA cryptography, and how does it work?\n    - A: It is a method of encrypting messages using DNA codons, where each codon substitutes for a specific letter or symbol\n    - B: It is a method of decrypting messages using DNA codons, where each codon substitutes for a specific letter or symbol\n    - C: It is a method of encoding messages using amino acids, where each amino acid substitutes for a specific letter or symbol\n    - D: It is a method of decoding messages using amino acids, where each amino acid substitutes for a specific letter or symbol\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) A company wants to store its historical documents and videos for long-term preservation. What method of storage would be most suitable?\n    - A: Magnetic tape\n    - B: Hard drive\n    - C: Cloud storage\n    - D: DNA storage\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What microorganism was used in an experiment to create a living, growing knowledge archive?\n    - A: E. coli\n    - B: Conan the Bacterium\n    - C: Yeast\n    - D: Virus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does DNA's structure allow it to store information?\n    - A: DNA's structure is unrelated to its ability to store information\n    - B: DNA's structure determines the rate of information storage\n    - C: DNA's structure affects the accuracy of information storage\n    - D: DNA's structure allows it to store information in the form of codons\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) How does DNA's storage capacity compare to traditional storage methods?\n    - A: DNA's storage capacity is lower than traditional storage methods\n    - B: DNA's storage capacity is similar to traditional storage methods\n    - C: DNA's storage capacity is significantly higher than traditional storage methods\n    - D: DNA's storage capacity is variable and depends on the specific method\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What are the potential benefits of using DNA storage for large-scale information preservation?\n    - A: High storage capacity\n    - B: Low cost\n    - C: Long lifespan\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What are the potential risks associated with using DNA storage?\n    - A: Data degradation\n    - B: Data contamination\n    - C: Data loss\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefinements made:\n- Minor wording changes to improve clarity and concision\n- Ensured distractors are plausible but incorrect\n- Confirmed correct answers are accurate\n\nNo more refinement needed."
