A: VOCs react with nitrogen oxides to form acid rain\n    - B: VOCs react with sunlight to form secondary pollutants\n    - C: VOCs are not involved in smog formation\n    - D: VOCs are the primary cause of smog\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the impact of smog on crops?\n    - A: Smog has no impact on crops\n    - B: Smog can damage and weaken crops\n    - C: Smog can increase crop yields\n    - D: Smog can reduce the need for pesticides\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the purpose of the Clean Air Act of 1956?\n    - A: To reduce the number of parks and green spaces\n    - B: To promote the use of mass transit\n    - C: To ban burning coal in certain areas\n    - D: To increase the number of coal-burning power plants\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What strategy can rapidly developing cities implement to reduce smog levels?\n    -
