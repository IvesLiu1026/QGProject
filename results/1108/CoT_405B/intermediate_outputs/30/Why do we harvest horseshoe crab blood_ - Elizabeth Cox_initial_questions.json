D: The blood is used to monitor the health of patients with bacterial infections\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect relationship between the biomedical industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood and the decline of their populations?\n    - A: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has led to an increase in their populations\n    - B: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has no impact on their populations\n    - C: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has led to a decline in their populations\n    - D: The industry's reliance on horseshoe crab blood has led to a stabilization of their populations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas) Questions**\n\n1) What makes horseshoe crab blood an important resource for the medical industry?\n    - A: Its high oxygen content and ability to detect viruses\n    - B: Its unique characteristics and highly sensitive immune response\n    - C: Its ability to detect bacteria and high nutrient content\n    - D: Its ability to detect fungal infections and high oxygen content\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What has led to the development of the LAL test?\n    - A: The combination of horseshoe crabs' vulnerability to viral infections and their highly sensitive immune response\n    - B: The combination of horseshoe crabs' vulnerability to bacterial infections and their highly sensitive immune response\n    - C: The combination of horseshoe crabs' highly developed immune system and their clean habitats\n    - D: The combination of horseshoe crabs' poorly developed immune system and their bacteria-filled habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification) Questions**\n\n1) Is the use of horseshoe crab blood in the biomedical industry justified, given the impact on their populations?\n    - A: Yes, the benefits to human health outweigh the impact on horseshoe crab populations\n    - B: No, the impact on horseshoe crab populations outweighs the benefits to human health\n    - C: The use of horseshoe crab blood is not necessary for human health\n    - D: The impact on horseshoe crab populations is not significant\n[Correct answer]: A (Note: This question requires a subjective judgment and may have different answers depending on individual perspectives.)\n\n2) Should researchers prioritize synthesizing horseshoe crab blood in the lab to reduce the demand for live crabs?\n    - A: Yes, synthesizing horseshoe crab blood is a more sustainable and humane option\n    - B: No, the current method of harvesting blood from live crabs is sufficient\n    - C: The decision to synthesize horseshoe crab blood should be based on economic factors\n    - D: The decision to synthesize horseshoe crab blood should be based on the availability of live crabs\n[Correct answer]: A (Note: This question requires a subjective judgment and may have different answers depending on individual perspectives.)"
