    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary cause of the unpleasant symptoms experienced during an illness, such as the flu?\n    - A: The infection itself\n    - B: The body's immune response\n    - C: The virus spreading to vital organs\n    - D: The brain's inability to function properly\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n2) Which type of cell is responsible for the initial attack on infected cells and viruses in the immune system's response to infection?\n    - A: Cytokines\n    - B: Macrophages\n    - C: T-cells\n    - D: Neutrophils\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the question more specific and added plausible distractors.\n\n3) What is the primary role of cytokines in the immune system's response to infection?\n    - A: To destroy infected cells directly\n    - B: To recruit and organize more virus-busting cells\n    - C: To increase body temperature\n    - D: To reduce inflammation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the question more specific and added plausible distractors.\n\n4) Which part of the brain is responsible for regulating body temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep?\n    - A: Hypothalamus\n    - B: Cerebral cortex\n    - C: Limbic system\n    - D: Brain stem\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n5) What is a possible benefit of the rise in body temperature during an illness?\n    - A: It increases energy levels\n    - B: It reduces pain\n    - C: It slows bacterial growth and helps the immune system destroy pathogens\n    - D: It increases appetite\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n6) Why does the body's reduced thirst during an illness lead to mild dehydration?\n    - A: To increase transmission of the infection\n    - B: To reduce the effectiveness of the immune system\n    - C: To diminish transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea\n    - D: To increase the severity of symptoms\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n7) What can occur when the immune system mistakenly treats normal bodily cues as threats?\n    - A: Autoimmune diseases\n    - B: Increased energy levels\n    - C: Improved immune function\n    - D: Reduced symptoms\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\n8) How do cytokines and prostaglandin affect the brain's neurotransmitters during an illness?\n    - A: They increase the production of neurotransmitters\n    - B: They disrupt the activity of neurotransmitters\n    - C: They have no effect on neurotransmitters\n    - D: They reduce the severity of symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined for clarity, no changes needed.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
