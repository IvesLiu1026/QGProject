What is an example of how the brain's different systems can conflict and lead to unexpected behaviors?\n    - A: Hiccups and yawning\n    - B: The photic sneeze reflex and hypnagogic myoclonus\n    - C: The pee shivers and post-micturition convulsion syndrome\n    - D: Sleep starts and the autopilot system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. What is an example of how the body's systems can work together to regulate breathing and other functions?\n    - A: The photic sneeze reflex and hypnagogic myoclonus\n    - B: Hiccups and yawning\n    - C: The pee shivers and post-micturition convulsion syndrome\n    - D: Sleep starts and the autopilot system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\n1. What can understanding the human body's involuntary behaviors help us appreciate?\n    - A: The complex and intricate systems that work together to keep us alive and functioning\n    - B: The social cues of yawning and other behaviors\n    - C: The need for control over our bodies\n    - D: The underlying medical issues of the pee shivers\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2. What can recognizing the social cues of yawning and other behaviors help us do?\n    - A: Develop strategies to manage or prevent involuntary behaviors\n    - B: Synchronize our biological clocks and stay alert\n    - C: Understand the complex and intricate systems of the human body\n    - D: Identify the underlying medical issues of the pee shivers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n1. Is the photic sneeze reflex a useful adaptation or simply a quirk of the human body?\n    - A: It is a useful adaptation that helps us regulate our breathing.\n    - B: It is a quirk of the human body with no known function.\n    - C: It is an evolutionary remnant from a few hundred million years ago.\n    - D: It is a sign of an underlying medical issue.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. Are hiccups and yawning essential functions or vestigial remnants of our evolutionary past?\n    - A: They are essential functions that regulate our breathing and other functions.\n    - B: They are vestigial remnants of our evolutionary past with no known function.\n    - C: They are signs of underlying medical issues.\n    - D: They are social cues that help us synchronize our biological clocks.\n[Correct answer]: B"
