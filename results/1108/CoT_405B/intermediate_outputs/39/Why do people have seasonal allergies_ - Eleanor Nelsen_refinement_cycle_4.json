    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is another term commonly used to describe seasonal allergies?\n    - A: Allergic asthma\n    - B: Hay fever or allergic rhinitis\n    - C: Food intolerance\n    - D: Autoimmune disorder\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which chemical is released by the immune system during an allergic reaction, causing blood vessels to swell and leak fluid?\n    - A: Serotonin\n    - B: Histamine\n    - C: Dopamine\n    - D: Adrenaline\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary reason the immune system releases histamine during an allergic reaction?\n    - A: To reduce inflammation\n    - B: To fight off an infection\n    - C: To cause blood vessels to swell and leak fluid, leading to symptoms such as itchiness and congestion\n    - D: To produce antibodies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) At what stage of life do allergies often first appear?\n    - A: Adulthood\n    - B: Old age\n    - C: Childhood\n    - D: Infancy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can understanding how allergies work help individuals do?\n    - A: Develop new allergies\n    - B: Take steps to prevent or manage their symptoms\n    - C: Ignore their allergy symptoms\n    - D: Blame their genetics for their allergies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Recognizing the signs of anaphylaxis and knowing how to respond can be:\n    - A: Life-threatening\n    - B: Ineffective\n    - C: Life-saving\n    - D: Unnecessary\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) The relationship between the immune system and allergies is best described as:\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and multifaceted\n    - C: Non-existent\n    - D: Only related to genetics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) The contrast between the immune system's response to harmless substances and its response to actual threats highlights the need for a:\n    - A: Stronger immune response\n    - B: Weaker immune response\n    - C: Balanced immune response that can distinguish between harmless and harmful substances\n    - D: No immune response\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the primary function of antihistamines in treating allergies?\n    - A: To reduce inflammation\n    - B: To fight off an infection\n    - C: To block histamine receptors and prevent symptoms such as itchiness and congestion\n    - D: To produce antibodies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) According to the hygiene hypothesis, what is one possible reason why people in industrialized countries are more likely to develop allergies?\n    - A: Lack of exposure to allergens\n    - B: Overexposure to allergens\n    - C: Reduced exposure to beneficial microorganisms\n    - D: Increased use of antibiotics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the goal of immunotherapy as a treatment for allergies?\n    - A: To eliminate the immune system's response to allergens\n    - B: To reduce the severity of allergic reactions\n    - C: To re-educate the immune system to recognize allergens as harmless\n    - D: To increase the immune system's response to allergens\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the primary factor that contributes to the development of allergies, according to the transcript?\n    - A: Genetics\n    - B: Environment\n    - C: Both genetics and environment\n    - D: Neither genetics nor environment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) How do steroids help in treating allergies?\n    - A: By increasing the immune system's response to allergens\n    - B: By reducing the immune system's response to allergens\n    - C: By blocking histamine receptors\n    - D: By producing antibodies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is anaphylaxis, and what are its typical symptoms?\n    - A: A mild allergic reaction with symptoms such as itchiness and congestion\n    - B: A severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as severe swelling, shortness of breath, and low blood pressure\n    - C: An autoimmune disorder with symptoms such as joint pain and fatigue\n    - D: A type of asthma with symptoms such as wheezing and coughing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What is the hygiene hypothesis, and what does it propose as a possible reason for the increased prevalence of allergies in industrialized countries?\n    - A: The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the increased use of antibiotics is the primary reason for the increased prevalence of allergies.\n    - B: The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the reduced exposure to beneficial microorganisms is the primary reason for the increased prevalence of allergies.\n    - C: The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the increased exposure to allergens is the primary reason for the increased prevalence of allergies.\n    - D: The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the decreased use of antibiotics is the primary reason for the increased prevalence of allergies.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-11. Questions 12-15 have been refined to better align with the key concepts and ensure clarity and conciseness."
