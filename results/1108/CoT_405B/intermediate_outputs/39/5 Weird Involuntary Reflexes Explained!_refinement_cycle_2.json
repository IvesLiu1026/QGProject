    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions as follows:\n\n1) What is the common term for the involuntary twitching of the muscles around the eye, which can be caused by dry eyes, caffeine, bright lights, or fatigue?\n    - A: Photogenic sneeze reflex\n    - B: Hypnagogic myoclonus\n    - C: Eye twitch\n    - D: Blepharospasm\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) According to the transcript, what percentage of people experience the photic sneeze reflex, also known as the Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst (ACHOO)?\n    - A: 1 in 10\n    - B: 1 in 4\n    - C: 1 in 2\n    - D: 3 in 4\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the term for the sudden, involuntary contraction of the muscles that occurs when a person is about to fall asleep, often causing them to wake up with a start?\n    - A: Hypnagogic myoclonus\n    - B: Sleep start\n    - C: Hiccup\n    - D: Yawn\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) What are two possible explanations for the origin of hiccups, according to the transcript?\n    - A: An evolutionary remnant from a few hundred million years ago and a way to clear air from the stomach\n    - B: A result of eating too quickly and a symptom of a serious medical condition\n    - C: A way to synchronize biological clocks and a social cue\n    - D: A method to cool the brain and a way to release noxious fumes\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) According to the transcript, what are some common remedies for getting rid of hiccups?\n    - A: Drinking water\n    - B: Holding one's breath\n    - C: Breathing into a paper bag\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What are two theories about the purpose of yawning, according to the transcript?\n    - A: To release noxious fumes from the body and to signal boredom\n    - B: To synchronize biological clocks and to cool the brain slightly\n    - C: To signal boredom and to cool the brain slightly\n    - D: To release noxious fumes and to synchronize biological clocks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the term for the involuntary shivering that occurs after urination, which may be caused by the exposure of sensitive areas to cold temperatures or conflicts between the autonomous nervous system and the conscious mind?\n    - A: Post-micturition convulsion syndrome\n    - B: Pee shivers\n    - C: Urination-induced shivering\n    - D: Autonomous nervous system response\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI made the following changes:\n- Clarified the questions to make them more concise and accurate.\n- Changed question 4 to include two possible explanations for the origin of hiccups.\n- Changed question 6 to include two theories about the purpose of yawning.\n- Made minor adjustments to the wording of the questions and options to improve clarity and consistency."
