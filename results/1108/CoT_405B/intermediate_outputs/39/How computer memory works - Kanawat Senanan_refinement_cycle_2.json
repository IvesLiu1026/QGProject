Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two possible values of a bit in computer memory?\n    - A: 0, 2\n    - B: 0, 1\n    - C: 1, 2\n    - D: -1, 1\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of RAM is made up of six interlocked transistors that don't need refreshing?\n    - A: Dynamic RAM (DRAM)\n    - B: Static RAM (SRAM)\n    - C: Magnetic RAM (MRAM)\n    - D: Optical RAM (ORAM)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the central processing unit (CPU) in a computer system?\n    - A: To store data in memory\n    - B: To process millions of bits to execute programs and tasks\n    - C: To provide power to the system\n    - D: To connect peripherals to the system\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main difference between short-term memory (RAM) and long-term memory (storage devices)?\n    - A: RAM is used for permanent storage, while storage devices are used for immediate tasks\n    - B: RAM is used for immediate tasks, while storage devices are used for more permanent storage\n    - C: RAM is faster than storage devices\n    - D: RAM is cheaper than storage devices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A company needs to design a computer system that can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. What type of storage device would be most suitable for this application?\n    - A: Magnetic storage\n    - B: Optical storage\n    - C: Solid-state drive\n    - D: Dynamic RAM (DRAM)\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) A developer wants to create an application that can run on a device with limited memory. What strategy could they use to optimize memory usage?\n    - A: Use more memory-intensive algorithms\n    - B: Store data in long-term memory instead of short-term memory\n    - C: Use compression algorithms to reduce data size\n    - D: Use caching to reduce memory access\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is a trade-off that computer designers often face when designing computer systems?\n    - A: Increasing size always increases cost and speed\n    - B: Decreasing size always decreases cost and speed\n    - C: Increasing speed often increases cost and size\n    - D: Decreasing cost always decreases size and speed\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a disadvantage of using dynamic RAM (DRAM) compared to static RAM (SRAM)?\n    - A: DRAM is faster than SRAM\n    - B: DRAM is cheaper than SRAM\n    - C: DRAM needs to be refreshed periodically\n    - D: DRAM uses more power than SRAM\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) A company wants to create a hybrid storage system that combines the benefits of magnetic storage and solid-state drives. What could be a potential design for this system?\n    - A: Use magnetic storage for frequently accessed data and solid-state drives for infrequently accessed data\n    - B: Use solid-state drives for frequently accessed data and magnetic storage for infrequently accessed data\n    - C: Use a combination of magnetic storage and dynamic RAM (DRAM)\n    - D: Use a combination of solid-state drives and static RAM (SRAM)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) A developer wants to create a new memory technology that addresses the limitations of current systems. What could be a potential approach?\n    - A: Develop a new type of dynamic RAM (DRAM) that is faster and cheaper\n    - B: Develop a new type of static RAM (SRAM) that is more energy-efficient\n    - C: Develop a new type of storage device that combines the benefits of magnetic storage and solid-state drives\n    - D: Develop a new type of memory that uses a different type of storage medium, such as phase-change memory\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) A company is considering using solid-state drives instead of magnetic storage for their data center. What factor should they consider when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of this decision?\n    - A: The initial cost of the solid-state drives\n    - B: The total cost of ownership, including maintenance and replacement costs\n    - C: The speed of the solid-state drives\n    - D: The capacity of the solid-state drives\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) A developer is considering using a new memory technology for their application. What factor should they consider when evaluating the reliability and durability of this technology?\n    - A: The manufacturer's reputation\n    - B: The technology's performance in benchmark tests\n    - C: The technology's mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR)\n    - D: The technology's cost\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and conciseness, but overall, the questions are well-written and align with the key concepts in the transcript. No more refinement needed."
