D: Autoimmune disorder\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Which chemical is released by the immune system during an allergic reaction, causing blood vessels to swell and leak fluid?\n    - A: Serotonin\n    - B: Histamine\n    - C: Dopamine\n    - D: Adrenaline\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary reason the immune system releases histamine during an allergic reaction?\n    - A: To reduce inflammation\n    - B: To fight off an infection\n    - C: To cause blood vessels to swell and leak fluid, leading to symptoms such as itchiness and congestion\n    - D: To produce antibodies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined question: What is the primary effect of histamine release during an allergic reaction?\n    -

A: Life-threatening\n    - B: Ineffective\n    - C: Life-saving\n    - D: Unnecessary\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) The relationship between the immune system and allergies is best described as:\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and multifaceted\n    - C: Non-existent\n    - D: Only related to genetics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) The contrast between the immune system's response to harmless substances and its response to actual threats highlights the need for a:\n    - A: Stronger immune response\n    - B: Weaker immune response\n    - C: Balanced immune response that can distinguish between harmless and harmful substances\n    - D: No immune response\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) Combining the ideas of the hygiene hypothesis and immunotherapy could lead to:\n    - A: New approaches to treating autoimmune disorders\n    - B: New approaches to treating allergies by re-educating the immune system\n    - C: New approaches to treating infections\n    - D: New approaches to treating cancer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) Understanding the role of genetics and environment in allergies could lead to:\n    - A: Generalized treatment plans\n    - B: Personalized treatment plans that take into account an individual's genetic and environmental factors\n    - C: No treatment plans\n    - D: Ineffective treatment plans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) To evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy as a treatment for allergies, it is essential to:\n    - A: Consider only the benefits of the approach\n    - B: Consider only the risks of the approach\n    - C: Consider both the benefits and risks of the approach to determine its overall effectiveness\n    - D: Ignore the risks and benefits of the approach\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n12) To assess the validity of the hygiene hypothesis, it is crucial to:\n    - A: Consider only the evidence supporting the theory\n    - B: Consider only the limitations of the theory\n    - C: Consider both the evidence supporting and potential limitations of the theory to determine its validity\n    - D: Ignore the evidence and limitations of the theory\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nAdditional refined questions:\n\n13) What is the primary function of antihistamines in treating allergies?\n    - A: To reduce inflammation\n    - B: To fight off an infection\n    - C: To block histamine receptors and prevent symptoms such as itchiness and congestion\n    - D: To produce antibodies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) According to the hygiene hypothesis, what is one possible reason why people in industrialized countries are more likely to develop allergies?\n    - A: Lack of exposure to allergens\n    - B: Overexposure to allergens\n    - C: Reduced exposure to beneficial microorganisms\n    - D: Increased use of antibiotics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is the goal of immunotherapy as a treatment for allergies?\n    -
