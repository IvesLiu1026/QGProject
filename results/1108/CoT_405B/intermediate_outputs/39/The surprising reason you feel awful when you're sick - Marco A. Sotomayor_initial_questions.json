What type of cells are the first line of defense against infection?\n    - A: T-cells\n    - B: Macrophages\n    - C: Neurons\n    - D: Platelets\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. Which part of the brain controls temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep?\n    - A: Cerebral cortex\n    - B: Limbic system\n    - C: Hypothalamus\n    - D: Brainstem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. What is the primary function of cytokines in the immune system?\n    - A: To produce prostaglandin E2\n    - B: To regulate body temperature\n    - C: To trigger a coordinated effort to fight infection\n    - D: To transmit information from the immune system to the brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is the result of the immune system's response to infection on the body?\n    - A: Only physical symptoms are affected\n    - B: Only emotions and cognitive function are affected\n    - C: Both physical symptoms and emotions/cognitive function are affected\n    - D: Neither physical symptoms nor emotions/cognitive function are affected\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. How can understanding the immune system's response to infection inform the development of treatments for autoimmune diseases?\n    - A: By targeting the infection itself\n    - B: By regulating the body's response to infection\n    - C: By suppressing the immune system entirely\n    - D: By ignoring the immune system's response\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. What can recognizing the role of cytokines and prostaglandin E2 in the immune response lead to?\n    - A: New therapeutic strategies for managing symptoms of illness\n    - B: A cure for autoimmune diseases\n    - C: A way to prevent all infections\n    - D: A better understanding of the limbic system\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1. What is the relationship between the immune system's response to infection and the symptoms of illness?\n    - A: The symptoms are solely a result of the infection itself\n    - B: The symptoms are solely a result of the immune system's response\n    - C: The symptoms are a result of both the infection and the immune system's response\n    - D: There is no relationship between the two\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What is the contrast between the immune system's response to infection and autoimmune diseases?\n    - A: The immune system attacks the body's own cells in both cases\n    - B: The immune system only attacks foreign cells in both cases\n    - C: The immune system attacks foreign cells in response to infection, but its own cells in autoimmune diseases\n    - D: The immune system does not respond to infection in autoimmune diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1. What can be inferred about the symptoms of illness based on the immune system's response to infection?\n    - A: They are solely a physical response\n    - B: They are solely an emotional response\n    - C: They are a complex interaction between physical, emotional, and cognitive components\n    - D: They are not related to the immune system's response\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What approach to managing symptoms of illness can be informed by the understanding that the immune system's response has both positive and negative effects on the body?\n    - A: A solely pharmaceutical approach\n    - B: A solely holistic approach\n    - C: A balanced approach that considers both the benefits and costs of the immune system's response\n    - D: A approach that ignores the immune system's response\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. How can the effectiveness of the immune system's response to infection be evaluated in different scenarios?\n    - A: By solely considering the physical symptoms\n    - B: By solely considering the emotional and cognitive effects\n    - C: By considering both the benefits (e.g., fighting off the infection) and costs (e.g., unpleasant symptoms)\n    - D: By ignoring the immune system's response\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What justification can be made for using certain treatments or therapies based on an understanding of the immune system's response to infection?\n    - A: They can cure all infections\n    - B: They can prevent all autoimmune diseases\n    - C: They can manage symptoms of illness by regulating the immune system's response\n    - D: They can suppress the immune system entirely\n[Correct answer]: C"
