    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is another term commonly used to describe seasonal allergies?\n    - A: Allergic asthma\n    - B: Hay fever or allergic rhinitis\n    - C: Food intolerance\n    - D: Autoimmune disorder\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which chemical is released by the immune system during an allergic reaction, causing blood vessels to swell and leak fluid?\n    - A: Serotonin\n    - B: Histamine\n    - C: Dopamine\n    - D: Adrenaline\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary reason the immune system releases histamine during an allergic reaction?\n    - A: To reduce inflammation\n    - B: To fight off an infection\n    - C: To cause blood vessels to swell and leak fluid\n    - D: To produce antibodies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) At what stage of life do allergies often first appear?\n    - A: Adulthood\n    - B: Old age\n    - C: Childhood\n    - D: Infancy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can understanding how allergies work help individuals do?\n    - A: Develop new allergies\n    - B: Take steps to prevent or manage their symptoms\n    - C: Ignore their allergy symptoms\n    - D: Blame their genetics for their allergies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Recognizing the signs of anaphylaxis and knowing how to respond can be:\n    - A: Life-threatening\n    - B: Ineffective\n    - C: Life-saving\n    - D: Unnecessary\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) The relationship between the immune system and allergies is best described as:\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and multifaceted\n    - C: Non-existent\n    - D: Only related to genetics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) The contrast between the immune system's response to harmless substances and its response to actual threats highlights the need for a:\n    - A: Stronger immune response\n    - B: Weaker immune response\n    - C: Balanced immune response\n    - D: No immune response\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) Combining the ideas of the hygiene hypothesis and immunotherapy could lead to:\n    - A: New approaches to treating autoimmune disorders\n    - B: New approaches to treating allergies\n    - C: New approaches to treating infections\n    - D: New approaches to treating cancer\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) Understanding the role of genetics and environment in allergies could lead to:\n    - A: Generalized treatment plans\n    - B: Personalized treatment plans\n    - C: No treatment plans\n    - D: Ineffective treatment plans\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) To evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy as a treatment for allergies, it is essential to:\n    - A: Consider only the benefits of the approach\n    - B: Consider only the risks of the approach\n    - C: Consider the risks and benefits of the approach\n    - D: Ignore the risks and benefits of the approach\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) To assess the validity of the hygiene hypothesis, it is crucial to:\n    - A: Consider only the evidence supporting the theory\n    - B: Consider only the limitations of the theory\n    - C: Consider the evidence and potential limitations of the theory\n    - D: Ignore the evidence and limitations of the theory\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, while ensuring the distractors remain plausible but incorrect. No significant changes were necessary, as the initial questions effectively covered the key concepts in the transcript."
