Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is self-assembly in the context of biological and chemical processes?\n    - A: A system where ordered parts come together in a random structure.\n    - B: A process that requires external direction or intervention.\n    - C: A system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure on their own.\n    - D: A method of manufacturing that relies on external energy sources.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What are proteins composed of that self-assemble into 3D structures?\n    - A: Sequences of DNA links\n    - B: Sequences of amino acid links\n    - C: Sequences of molecular microchips\n    - D: Sequences of cellular components\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is one of the ways self-assembly enables our bodies to function?\n    - A: By allowing our bodies to grow and adapt to new environments.\n    - B: By enabling our bodies to regrow and repair themselves, and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n    - C: By providing our bodies with the ability to design and build technologies.\n    - D: By giving our bodies the capacity to create complex structures with external direction.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the potential benefits of self-assembly in various fields?\n    - A: The ability to rely more heavily on fossil fuels.\n    - B: The potential to revolutionize the way we design and build technologies.\n    - C: The capacity to create simple structures with external direction.\n    - D: The ability to limit the creation of complex structures.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one potential application of self-assembly in the field of medicine?\n    -
