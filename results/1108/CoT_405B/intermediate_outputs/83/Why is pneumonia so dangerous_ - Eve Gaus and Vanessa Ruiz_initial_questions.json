    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the primary function of the alveoli in the lungs?\n    - A: To filter the air we breathe\n    - B: To facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\n    - C: To produce mucus and trap invaders\n    - D: To regulate body temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which of the following is a common pathogen that can cause pneumonia?\n    - A: Fungus\n    - B: Virus\n    - C: Bacteria\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) How does pneumonia disrupt the normal breathing process?\n    - A: By causing the trachea to constrict\n    - B: By filling the alveoli with fluid, making gas exchange more difficult\n    - C: By increasing the production of mucus\n    - D: By reducing the surface area of the lungs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the role of the immune system in responding to pneumonia?\n    - A: To release white blood cells and generate inflammation\n    - B: To produce antibodies and fight off the infection\n    - C: To increase the production of mucus and trap invaders\n    - D: To reduce the body's temperature\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1) A person with pneumonia is experiencing rapid breathing and coughing. What is the most likely course of treatment?\n    - A: Antibiotics and rest\n    - B: Surgery to remove the infected tissue\n    - C: Oxygen therapy to increase oxygen levels\n    - D: Physical therapy to improve lung function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A healthcare professional is trying to determine the cause of a patient's pneumonia. What information would be most useful in making a diagnosis?\n    - A: The patient's symptoms and medical history\n    - B: The patient's lifestyle and habits\n    - C: The patient's family history\n    - D: The patient's age and sex\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and Contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the mucociliary escalator and the immune system's response to pneumonia?\n    - A: The escalator traps invaders, while the immune system releases white blood cells to fight the infection\n    - B: The escalator produces mucus, while the immune system generates inflammation\n    - C: The escalator regulates body temperature, while the immune system fights off the infection\n    - D: The escalator increases oxygen levels, while the immune system reduces carbon dioxide levels\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How does smoking affect the risk of pneumonia?\n    - A: Smoking reduces the risk of pneumonia by damaging the cilia\n    - B: Smoking increases the risk of pneumonia by damaging the cilia\n    - C: Smoking has no effect on the risk of pneumonia\n    - D: Smoking reduces the risk of pneumonia by increasing mucus production\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1) What is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia?\n    - A: Getting vaccinated and washing hands regularly\n    - B: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding smoking\n    - C: Taking antibiotics regularly and getting vaccinated\n    - D: Combining a healthy lifestyle, vaccination, and good hygiene practices\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How do the immune system, the mucociliary escalator, and the alveoli work together to respond to pneumonia?\n    - A: The immune system releases white blood cells, the escalator traps invaders, and the alveoli facilitate gas exchange\n    - B: The immune system generates inflammation, the escalator produces mucus, and the alveoli regulate body temperature\n    - C: The immune system fights off the infection, the escalator increases oxygen levels, and the alveoli reduce carbon dioxide levels\n    - D: The immune system releases antibodies, the escalator reduces mucus production, and the alveoli increase surface area\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and Critique)**\n\n1) Are antibiotics effective in treating both viral and bacterial pneumonia?\n    - A: Yes, antibiotics are equally effective in treating both types of pneumonia\n    - B: No, antibiotics are only effective in treating bacterial pneumonia\n    - C: Yes, antibiotics are more effective in treating viral pneumonia\n    - D: No, antibiotics are not effective in treating either type of pneumonia\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the impact of lack of access to healthcare on pneumonia outcomes?\n    - A: Limited access to care has no effect on pneumonia outcomes\n    - B: Limited access to care increases mortality rates and worsens outcomes\n    - C: Limited access to care reduces mortality rates and improves outcomes\n    - D: Limited access to care has a variable effect on pneumonia outcomes\n[Correct answer]: B"
