    "initial_questions": "Here are the multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the name of the world's largest hydroelectric plant?\n    - A: The Itaipu Dam\n    - B: The Three Gorges Dam\n    - C: The Hoover Dam\n    - D: The Grand Coulee Dam\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many turbines does the Three Gorges Dam have?\n    - A: 20 turbines\n    - B: 25 turbines\n    - C: 32 turbines\n    - D: 40 turbines\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) How do hydroelectric dams generate electricity?\n    - A: By burning fossil fuels to power a turbine\n    - B: By redirecting a river's natural flow through a large pipe called a penstock, which turns the blades of a turbine\n    - C: By harnessing the energy of the sun to power a turbine\n    - D: By using nuclear reactions to power a turbine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is one of the benefits of the Three Gorges Dam's design?\n    - A: It can only produce power during stormy seasons\n    - B: It can produce power regardless of the weather\n    - C: It can only produce power during dry seasons\n    - D: It can only produce power at night\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) What is one of the ways that hydroelectric dams can be used to benefit the environment?\n    - A: By causing floods and destroying habitats\n    - B: By preventing floods and improving the navigability of rivers\n    - C: By polluting the air and water\n    - D: By destroying historical sites\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is the Three Gorges Dam a reliable source of energy?\n    - A: Because it can only produce power during stormy seasons\n    - B: Because it can produce power regardless of the weather\n    - C: Because it is powered by fossil fuels\n    - D: Because it is powered by nuclear reactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What determines a dam's energy output?\n    - A: The number of turbines alone\n    - B: The force and frequency of water moving through the turbines alone\n    - C: The relationship between the number of turbines and the force and frequency of water moving through them\n    - D: The location of the dam alone\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is one of the reasons why the Itaipu Dam can outperform the Three Gorges Dam in terms of energy output?\n    - A: Because it has fewer turbines\n    - B: Because it is located in a area with a constant flow of water\n    - C: Because it is powered by fossil fuels\n    - D: Because it is powered by nuclear reactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What is one of the considerations that must be taken into account when constructing large dams?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits of hydroelectric power\n    - B: Only the environmental impacts\n    - C: Only the human impacts\n    - D: Both the environmental and human impacts, as well as the potential benefits of hydroelectric power\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) Why is the development of sustainable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, important?\n    - A: Because it will increase our reliance on finite fossil fuels\n    - B: Because it will mitigate the impacts of climate change\n    - C: Because it will destroy historical sites\n    - D: Because it will cause floods and destroy habitats\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) Was the construction of the Three Gorges Dam a justified decision?\n    - A: No, because it displaced people and destroyed historical sites\n    - B: Yes, because it provides hydroelectric power and prevents floods\n    - C: Maybe, because it has both positive and negative impacts\n    - D: Only if it is powered by fossil fuels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is one of the costs that must be weighed against the benefits of the Three Gorges Dam's construction?\n    - A: The cost of building the dam\n    - B: The cost of maintaining the dam\n    - C: The displacement of 1.4 million people and the destruction of historical sites\n    - D: The cost of powering the dam with fossil fuels\n[Correct answer]: C"
