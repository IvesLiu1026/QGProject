    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) In a 1990s study, what percentage of participants recalled false memories of getting lost in a shopping mall as children after being told they had gotten lost?\n    - A: 10%\n    - B: 25%\n    - C: 50%\n    - D: 75%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the term for attributing information from one context to another, resulting in incorrect memories?\n    - A: Suggestibility\n    - B: Misattribution\n    - C: False memory\n    - D: Memory bias\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What did the study on university campus images demonstrate about human memory?\n    - A: Suggestibility can lead to false memories\n    - B: Misattribution can lead to incorrect memories\n    - C: Our memories are objective representations of reality\n    - D: The problems with memory arise from treating it as subjective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to the transcript, what is the fundamental nature of our memories?\n    - A: Objective representations of reality\n    - B: Subjective perceptions\n    - C: Factual accounts of past events\n    - D: Completely reliable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) In what context can the fallibilities of memory have significant consequences, such as incorrect identifications or unreliable confessions?\n    - A: Medical settings\n    - B: Courtrooms\n    - C: Police interrogations\n    - D: Historical research\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How can recognizing the subjective nature of memory benefit us in our daily lives?\n    - A: By making us more confident in our memories\n    - B: By making us more critical of our own memories and considering alternative perspectives\n    - C: By allowing us to ignore external influences on our memories\n    - D: By making us more reliant on our memories\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What relationship was highlighted by the study on the legalization of marijuana?\n    - A: Between suggestibility and false memories\n    - B: Between misattribution and incorrect memories\n    - C: Between our current opinions and our memories of how we felt in the past\n    - D: Between knowledge of the outcome and our perceptions of the past\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What contrast is emphasized throughout the transcript?\n    - A: Between the subjective nature of memory and the objective nature of reality\n    - B: Between suggestibility and misattribution\n    - C: Between false memories and correct memories\n    - D: Between our current opinions and our past opinions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What can be concluded by combining the concepts of suggestibility, misattribution, and bias?\n    - A: That our memories are completely reliable\n    - B: That our memories are influenced by various factors and can lead to incorrect or false memories\n    - C: That our memories are objective representations of reality\n    - D: That the problems with memory arise from treating it as subjective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can understanding the subjective nature of memory help us develop?\n    - A: Strategies for improving our memory and reducing the influence of external factors\n    - B: Methods for ignoring external influences on our memories\n    - C: Techniques for making our memories more objective\n    - D: Ways to make our memories more reliable\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the main argument presented by the transcript regarding the nature of memory?\n    - A: That our memories are objective representations of reality\n    - B: That our memories are subjective perceptions\n    - C: That our memories are completely reliable\n    - D: That the problems with memory arise from treating it as subjective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) According to the transcript, what is the consequence of treating memory as fact?\n    - A: It makes our memories more reliable\n    - B: It allows us to ignore external influences on our memories\n    - C: It leads to problems with memory\n    - D: It makes our memories more objective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, as they already aligned with the key concepts in the transcript and had plausible distractors. Minor refinements were made to enhance clarity and conciseness."
