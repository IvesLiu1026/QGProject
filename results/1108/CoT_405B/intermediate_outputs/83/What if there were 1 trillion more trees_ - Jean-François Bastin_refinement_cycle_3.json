Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated age of the giant sequoia nicknamed General Sherman?\n    - A: 1,500 years\n    - B: 2,000 years\n    - C: 2,500 years\n    - D: 3,000 years\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What process do plants use to release carbon back into the atmosphere?\n    - A: Respiration\n    - B: Photosynthesis\n    - C: Decomposition\n    - D: Transpiration\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What role do trees play in combating climate change?\n    - A: They produce greenhouse gases.\n    - B: They sequester carbon from the atmosphere.\n    - C: They have no impact on climate change.\n    - D: They only provide shade.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to some of the carbon stored in trees when they die and decay?\n    - A: It is released back into the atmosphere.\n    - B: It is stored in the soil forever.\n    - C: It is converted into oxygen.\n    - D: It is absorbed by other plants.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is a sustainable way to promote biodiversity and carbon sequestration in depleted ecosystems?\n    - A: Introducing non-native tree species.\n    - B: Restoring depleted ecosystems with native tree species.\n    - C: Clear-cutting forests to make way for new growth.\n    - D: Using pesticides to control pests.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What tool can be used to identify areas suitable for reforestation efforts?\n    - A: Satellite imagery and climate data.\n    - B: Soil sampling and tree surveys.\n    - C: Aerial photography and topographic maps.\n    - D: Ground-penetrating radar and thermal imaging.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between tree growth and carbon sequestration?\n    - A: As trees grow, they release more carbon into the atmosphere.\n    - B: As trees grow, they sequester more carbon from the atmosphere.\n    - C: Tree growth has no impact on carbon sequestration.\n    - D: Tree growth only affects carbon sequestration in certain climates.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the carbon sequestration of General Sherman compare to humanity's carbon production?\n    - A: General Sherman sequesters more carbon than humanity produces in a year.\n    - B: General Sherman sequesters a similar amount of carbon to humanity's production in a year.\n    - C: General Sherman sequesters a small fraction of the carbon that humanity produces in a minute.\n    - D: General Sherman has no impact on the carbon cycle.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a key consideration when developing effective climate change mitigation strategies?\n    - A: Focusing solely on reducing fossil fuel emissions.\n    - B: Focusing solely on restoring depleted ecosystems.\n    - C: Combining carbon sequestration, ecosystem diversity, and sustainable forest management.\n    - D: Ignoring the potential interactions between restored ecosystems and the global carbon cycle.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential benefit of integrating satellite imagery, climate data, and ecological research?\n    - A: Identifying areas suitable for urban development.\n    - B: Identifying areas suitable for reforestation efforts.\n    - C: Predicting weather patterns.\n    - D: Monitoring wildlife populations.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is an important consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of reforestation efforts?\n    - A: Only considering the number of trees planted.\n    - B: Only considering the cost of the project.\n    - C: Assessing the impact on the global carbon cycle and ecosystem diversity.\n    - D: Ignoring potential unintended consequences.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it essential to protect existing forests?\n    - A: To promote urban development.\n    - B: To support agriculture and livestock.\n    - C: To maintain ecosystem diversity and prevent further carbon emissions.\n    - D: To ignore the potential risks and benefits of different management practices.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What is a potential risk of large-scale reforestation efforts?\n    - A: Increased biodiversity\n    - B: Decreased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: Unintended consequences, such as accelerated climate change\n    - D: Increased forest fires\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) Why is it essential to consider the long-term protection and management of restored ecosystems?\n    - A: To ensure the survival of newly planted trees\n    - B: To maintain ecosystem diversity and prevent further carbon emissions\n    - C: To support agriculture and livestock\n    - D: To promote urban development\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What is the importance of ecosystem diversity in combating climate change?\n    - A: Ecosystem diversity has no impact on climate change\n    - B: Ecosystem diversity can exacerbate climate change\n    - C: Ecosystem diversity can help mitigate climate change\n    - D: Ecosystem diversity is only important for biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
