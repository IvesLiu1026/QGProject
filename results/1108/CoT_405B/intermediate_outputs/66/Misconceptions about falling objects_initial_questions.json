What would be a suitable approach?\n    - A: Dropping objects of different masses from the same height and measuring their fall times.\n    - B: Measuring the force of gravity on objects of different masses using a spring scale.\n    - C: Rolling objects of different masses down an inclined plane and measuring their speeds.\n    - D: Using a pendulum to measure the period of oscillation for objects of different masses.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis Level Questions**\n\n1) What is a common misconception about the motion of objects under the influence of gravity?\n    - A: Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.\n    - B: Objects fall at a constant speed.\n    - C: Gravity only affects objects on Earth.\n    - D: All of the above.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How does inertia relate to the acceleration of objects under the influence of gravity?\n    - A: Inertia causes objects to accelerate faster.\n    - B: Inertia causes objects to accelerate slower.\n    - C: Inertia has no effect on the acceleration of objects.\n    - D: Inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its motion.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis Level Questions**\n\n1) A projectile is launched from the ground with an initial velocity. How would you explain the motion of the projectile in terms of gravity, acceleration, and inertia?\n    - A: The projectile accelerates upward due to gravity, and its inertia causes it to maintain its velocity.\n    - B: The projectile accelerates downward due to gravity, and its inertia causes it to resist changes in its motion.\n    - C: The projectile moves in a straight line due to its initial velocity, and gravity has no effect on its motion.\n    - D: The projectile accelerates upward due to its initial velocity, and gravity causes it to slow down.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A physicist wants to design a new experiment to test the effects of gravity on objects of different masses. What would be a suitable approach that combines the concepts of gravity, acceleration, and inertia?\n    - A: Dropping objects of different masses from the same height and measuring their fall times.\n    - B: Using a centrifuge to measure the effect of gravity on objects of different masses.\n    - C: Designing a roller coaster track to test the effects of gravity and inertia on objects of different masses.\n    - D: Creating a computer simulation to model the motion of objects under the influence of gravity.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation Level Questions**\n\n1) A student claims that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. What would be a suitable response to evaluate the validity of this claim?\n    - A: That's correct, because heavier objects have more mass and therefore more gravity.\n    - B: That's incorrect, because the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass.\n    - C: That's partially correct, because the force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object.\n    - D: That's irrelevant, because the concept of gravity is not applicable in this scenario.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A researcher designs an experiment to test the effects of gravity on objects of different masses by dropping them from the same height and measuring their fall times. What would be a suitable critique of this experiment?\n    - A: The experiment is flawed because it doesn't account for air resistance.\n    - B: The experiment is flawed because it doesn't use a large enough sample size.\n    - C: The experiment is flawed because it doesn't measure the force of gravity directly.\n    - D: The experiment is well-designed and will produce accurate results.\n[Correct answer]: A"
