Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many years ago did humans branch off from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees?\n    - A: 1-2 million years ago\n    - B: 6-8 million years ago\n    - C: 10-12 million years ago\n    - D: 20-25 million years ago\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What was the cost of the human genome project?\n    - A: $1.5 billion\n    - B: $2.7 billion\n    - C: $3.5 billion\n    - D: $4.5 billion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the speaker, what is \"neo-evolution\" about?\n    - A: Studying the past evolution of humans\n    - B: Guiding and choosing human evolution through genetic changes\n    - C: Understanding the evolution of other species\n    - D: Analyzing the environment's impact on evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main idea behind \"directed evolution\"?\n    - A: Encouraging the natural process of evolution to work slower and less efficiently\n    - B: Encouraging the natural process of evolution to work faster and more efficiently\n    - C: Studying the evolution of humans in the past\n    - D: Analyzing the environment's impact on evolution\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) According to the speaker, what are some potential uses of genetic engineering?\n    - A: Creating viruses that can induce immunity against other viruses\n    - B: Eliminating diseases such as diabetes or Alzheimer's\n    - C: Enhancing physical abilities such as memory or athletic performance\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is a potential consequence of genetic changes made to humans?\n    - A: The changes will only affect the individual who undergoes the procedure\n    - B: The changes will be passed on to future generations\n    - C: The changes will have no impact on society\n    - D: The changes will only affect the environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) According to the speaker, what is the main difference between the goals of evolution and the goals of medicine?\n    - A: Evolution focuses on preserving the body, while medicine focuses on passing on the genome\n    - B: Evolution focuses on passing on the genome, while medicine focuses on preserving the body\n    - C: Evolution focuses on adapting to the environment, while medicine focuses on changing the environment\n    - D: Evolution focuses on creating a more uniform society, while medicine focuses on creating a more robust society\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) According to the speaker, how have humans affected their environment, and how has the environment affected humans?\n    - A: Humans have adapted to their environment, and the environment has had no impact on humans\n    - B: Humans have adapted to their environment, and the environment has also been affected by humans\n    - C: The environment has adapted to humans, and humans have had no impact on the environment\n    - D: The environment has adapted to humans, and humans have also been affected by the environment\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What concept does the speaker propose by combining the ideas of evolution, genetic engineering, and medicine?\n    - A: Neo-evolution\n    - B: Directed evolution\n    - C: Genetic drift\n    - D: Natural selection\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) According to the speaker, what are some potential possibilities of combining the ideas of directed evolution and genetic engineering?\n    - A: The possibility of creating a more uniform society\n    - B: The possibility of creating a more robust society\n    - C: The possibility of guiding and choosing human evolution\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) According to the speaker, what is a potential critique of the idea that evolution is solely about the past?\n    - A: Evolution is only about the past and has no relevance to the present or future\n    - B: Evolution is only about the present and has no relevance to the past or future\n    - C: Evolution is also about the future and has relevance to humans as well as other species\n    - D: Evolution is only about humans and has no relevance to other species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) According to the speaker, what is a necessary consideration when making decisions about genetic engineering?\n    - A: The potential benefits of genetic engineering\n    - B: The potential risks of genetic engineering\n    - C: The need for wisdom and caution in making such decisions\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined questions 1-12 are clear and concise, and the distractors are plausible but incorrect. The correct answers are accurate and align with the key concepts in the transcript. No more refinement needed."
