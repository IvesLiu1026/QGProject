Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated megapixel equivalent of the human eye?\n    - A: 100 megapixels\n    - B: 500 megapixels\n    - C: 1000 megapixels\n    - D: 2000 megapixels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Who used photography to solve the galloping horse mystery around 150 years ago?\n    - A: Ã‰tienne-Jules Marey\n    - B: Eadweard Muybridge\n    - C: Louis Le Prince\n    - D: William Henry Fox Talbot\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is one of the limitations of the human eye?\n    - A: It can see in complete darkness\n    - B: It can keep up with extremely fast-moving objects\n    - C: It can see underwater with perfect clarity\n    - D: It cannot keep up with fast-moving objects\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) How has photography enhanced our understanding of the world?\n    - A: By allowing us to capture and analyze phenomena that are too slow or large for the naked eye\n    - B: By allowing us to capture and analyze phenomena that are too fast, small, or complex for the naked eye\n    - C: By allowing us to capture and analyze phenomena that are only visible in complete darkness\n    - D: By allowing us to capture and analyze phenomena that are only visible underwater\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A researcher wants to study the movement patterns of a specific bird species. What tool could they use to capture and analyze the birds' movements?\n    - A: Binoculars\n    - B: Camera\n    - C: Microscope\n    - D: Radar\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A scientist wants to track the recession of a glacier over time. What method could they use to document their findings?\n    - A: Taking notes by hand\n    - B: Using a camera to take regular photographs\n    - C: Creating a diagram by hand\n    - D: Using satellite imaging\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is one of the benefits of using photography in scientific research?\n    - A: It can only capture phenomena that are visible to the naked eye\n    - B: It can only capture phenomena that are too slow or large for the naked eye\n    - C: It can capture phenomena that are too fast, small, or complex for the naked eye\n    - D: It can only capture phenomena that are visible underwater\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is one of the limitations of the human eye compared to cameras?\n    - A: The human eye can see in complete darkness, while cameras cannot\n    - B: The human eye can keep up with extremely fast-moving objects, while cameras cannot\n    - C: The human eye can see underwater with perfect clarity, while cameras cannot\n    - D: The human eye cannot keep up with fast-moving objects, while cameras can\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) A researcher wants to study the impact of environmental changes on plant growth. What methods could they combine to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon?\n    - A: Photography and microscopy\n    - B: Photography and spectrometry\n    - C: Photography and statistical analysis\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the term for the growth of plants towards light?\n    - A: Phototropism\n    - B: Photosynthesis\n    - C: Transpiration\n    - D: Respiration\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) A scientist wants to develop a new photographic technique to capture and analyze phenomena that are currently beyond our capabilities. What could they consider combining?\n    - A: Photography and microscopy\n    - B: Photography and spectrometry\n    - C: Photography and other scientific tools\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is one of the contributions of photography to scientific research?\n    - A: It has hindered our understanding of the world\n    - B: It has not contributed significantly to scientific research\n    - C: It has enhanced our understanding of the world by allowing us to capture and analyze phenomena that are too fast, small, or complex for the naked eye\n    - D: It has only contributed to the field of environmental science\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) What is one potential limitation of photography as a scientific tool?\n    - A: It can capture phenomena that are too fast, small, or complex for the naked eye\n    - B: It can only capture phenomena that are visible to the naked eye\n    - C: It can be subjective and prone to bias\n    - D: It can only capture phenomena that are visible underwater\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more significant refinements are needed, but minor adjustments can be made based on further feedback."
