Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the speaker's profession at the University of Pennsylvania?\n    - A: Electrical engineering professor\n    - B: Mechanical engineering professor\n    - C: Computer science professor\n    - D: Photography professor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the term used to describe the technique of capturing and recreating the feel of objects developed by the speaker?\n    - A: Haptics\n    - B: Haptography\n    - C: Kinesthetic sensations technology\n    - D: Tactile feedback technology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to the speaker, what is the significance of the sense of touch in physical interactions?\n    - A: It is involved in some manipulation tasks\n    - B: It is involved in every manipulation task\n    - C: It is not crucial for physical interactions\n    - D: It is only crucial for certain physical interactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the applications of haptics mentioned by the speaker in collaboration with Dr. Margrit Maggio?\n    - A: Teaching dental students to identify cavities using visual feedback\n    - B: Teaching dental students to identify cavities using haptic feedback\n    - C: Teaching medical students to identify organs using haptic feedback\n    - D: Teaching sports students to improve movement using haptic feedback\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can haptics be used in online shopping, according to the speaker?\n    - A: To allow customers to see the texture of products\n    - B: To allow customers to feel the texture of products\n    - C: To allow customers to hear the sound of products\n    - D: To allow customers to read reviews of products\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is the purpose of using haptics in medical training, as mentioned by the speaker?\n    - A: To simulate the sound of different medical procedures\n    - B: To simulate the sight of different medical procedures\n    - C: To simulate the feel of different tissues and organs\n    - D: To simulate the smell of different medical procedures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between tactile sensations and kinesthetic sensations in the sense of touch?\n    - A: They are two separate senses\n    - B: They are two main components of the sense of touch\n    - C: They are only involved in some physical interactions\n    - D: They are not crucial for physical interactions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a potential benefit of using haptics in sports training, as mentioned by the speaker?\n    - A: Reduced performance and increased cost\n    - B: Improved performance and increased cost\n    - C: Reduced performance and reduced cost\n    - D: Improved performance and reduced cost\nRefined answer options: \n    - A: Reduced performance and increased cost\n    - B: Improved performance and increased cost\n    - C: Reduced performance and reduced cost\n    - D: Improved performance through more efficient practice\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n9) This question was removed as it was not directly related to the transcript.\n\n10) How can haptics be used to enhance human-computer interaction?\n    - A: By providing only visual feedback\n    - B: By providing only auditory feedback\n    - C: By providing tactile and kinesthetic feedback\n    - D: By providing only kinesthetic feedback\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) This question was removed as it was not directly related to the transcript.\n\n12) What is the main goal of the speaker's research in haptics?\n    - A: To improve the sense of sight\n    - B: To improve the sense of hearing\n    - C: To leverage the human capability with the sense of touch\n    - D: To reduce the importance of the sense of touch\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nAdditionally, I have removed questions 9 and 11 as they were not directly related to the transcript. I have refined question 8 to have more accurate answer options."
