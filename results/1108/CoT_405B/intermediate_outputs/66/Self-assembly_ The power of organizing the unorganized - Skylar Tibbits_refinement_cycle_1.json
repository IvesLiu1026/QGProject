    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is self-assembly?\n    - A: A process where ordered parts come together in a disorganized structure.\n    - B: A system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure on their own.\n    - C: A method of manufacturing complex structures using external direction and control.\n    - D: A technique used only in robotics and social networks.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) In which fields does self-assembly occur?\n    - A: Only in biology and chemistry.\n    - B: Only in magnets and snowflakes.\n    - C: In various fields, including biology, chemistry, magnets, snowflakes, robotics, social networks, city formations, and galaxies.\n    - D: Only in biotechnology and engineering.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What enables our bodies to regrow and repair themselves, and pass on genes from one generation to the next?\n    - A: External direction and control.\n    - B: Self-assembly.\n    - C: Adaptation and evolution.\n    - D: Genetic mutation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is self-assembly being used as in the development of next-generation technologies?\n    - A: A new design, science, and engineering tool.\n    - B: A traditional manufacturing method.\n    - C: A technique for creating simple structures.\n    - D: A method for external direction and control.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How can self-assembly be used to create complex structures, such as spheres?\n    - A: Through traditional manufacturing methods.\n    - B: By designing connections between components, such as magnets, to facilitate self-assembly.\n    - C: Using external direction and control.\n    - D: Only in biology and chemistry.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is one of the applications of self-assembly in the field of biotechnology?\n    - A: Creating adaptive materials.\n    - B: Developing molecular microchips and 3-D structures with DNA.\n    - C: Designing more efficient and sustainable systems.\n    - D: Creating self-healing systems.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What determines the 3-D structure of a protein?\n    - A: The sequence of amino acid links alone.\n    - B: The environment alone.\n    - C: The relationship between the amino acids in a protein chain and the environment.\n    - D: The design of the components alone.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What allows sub-units in a virus to fit together precisely and form a complex structure?\n    - A: External direction and control.\n    - B: The attraction between sub-units.\n    - C: The design of the components alone.\n    - D: The environment alone.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What could be the result of combining self-assembly with other technologies, such as 3-D printing?\n    - A: The creation of simple structures with unique properties.\n    - B: The creation of complex structures with unique properties.\n    - C: The development of self-healing materials and systems.\n    - D: The integration of self-assembly with artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How could the concept of self-assembly be applied to social networks and city planning?\n    - A: To create more rigid and inflexible systems.\n    - B: To create more adaptive and efficient systems.\n    - C: To design more traditional and hierarchical systems.\n    - D: To develop more complex and disorganized systems.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of self-assembly?\n    - A: Only the potential benefits.\n    - B: Only the potential challenges and limitations.\n    - C: Both the potential benefits and the potential challenges and limitations.\n    - D: Neither the potential benefits nor the potential challenges and limitations.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What should be evaluated when considering the development of self-assembly technologies?\n    - A: Only their potential to address global challenges.\n    - B: Only their potential impact on various industries and societies.\n    - C: Both their potential to address global challenges and their potential impact on various industries and societies.\n    - D: Neither their potential to address global challenges nor their potential impact on various industries and societies.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 5 and 9 to improve clarity and concision. The other questions remain unchanged, as they already meet the refinement criteria."
