    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What happens when two objects of different masses are dropped from the same height at the same time?\n    - A: The heavier object hits the ground first.\n    - B: The lighter object hits the ground first.\n    - C: Both objects hit the ground at the same time.\n    - D: It depends on the mass of the objects.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the primary force responsible for causing objects to accelerate towards the ground?\n    - A: Electromagnetic force\n    - B: Frictional force\n    - C: Gravitational force\n    - D: Normal force\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is a fundamental concept about the acceleration due to gravity?\n    - A: It varies depending on the mass of the object.\n    - B: It is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass or weight.\n    - C: It only applies to objects on Earth.\n    - D: It is constant over time but varies with altitude.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the force of gravity affect objects as they fall towards the ground?\n    - A: It slows them down.\n    - B: It keeps their speed constant.\n    - C: It causes them to speed up.\n    - D: It has no effect on their motion.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A skydiver and a bowling ball are dropped from the same height at the same time. What can be expected to happen, assuming no air resistance?\n    - A: The bowling ball will hit the ground first.\n    - B: The skydiver will hit the ground first.\n    - C: Both the skydiver and the bowling ball will hit the ground at the same time.\n    - D: It depends on the mass of the skydiver and the bowling ball.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a common misconception about the motion of objects under the influence of gravity?\n    - A: Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.\n    - B: Objects fall at a constant speed.\n    - C: Gravity only affects objects on Earth.\n    - D: All of the above.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) How does inertia relate to the acceleration of objects under the influence of gravity?\n    - A: Inertia causes objects to accelerate faster.\n    - B: Inertia causes objects to accelerate slower.\n    - C: Inertia has no effect on the acceleration of objects.\n    - D: Inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its motion.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What would be a suitable approach to test the effects of gravity on objects of different masses?\n    - A: Dropping objects of different masses from the same height and measuring their fall times in a vacuum.\n    - B: Measuring the force of gravity on objects of different masses using a spring scale.\n    - C: Rolling objects of different masses down an inclined plane and measuring their speeds.\n    - D: Using a pendulum to measure the period of oscillation for objects of different masses.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) A student claims that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. What would be a suitable response to evaluate the validity of this claim?\n    - A: That's correct, because heavier objects have more mass and therefore more gravity.\n    - B: That's incorrect, because the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass.\n    - C: That's partially correct, because the force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object.\n    - D: That's irrelevant, because the concept of gravity is not applicable in this scenario.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a limitation of an experiment that involves dropping objects of different masses from the same height and measuring their fall times?\n    - A: The experiment is flawed because it doesn't account for air resistance.\n    - B: The experiment is flawed because it doesn't use a large enough sample size.\n    - C: The experiment is flawed because it doesn't measure the force of gravity directly.\n    - D: The experiment is well-designed and will produce accurate results.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were similar to questions 9 and 10, respectively. I also refined the wording of some questions to make them clearer and more concise. Additionally, I changed the correct answer for question 5 to assume no air resistance, as this is a crucial assumption in the context of the question."
