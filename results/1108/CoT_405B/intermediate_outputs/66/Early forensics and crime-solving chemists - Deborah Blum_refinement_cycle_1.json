    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, enhance clarity and conciseness, and confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) When did the United States start training scientists in forensics?\n    - A: 1910s\n    - B: 1920s\n    - C: 1930s\n    - D: 1940s\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who was appointed as the first trained medical examiner in New York City in 1918?\n    - A: Alexander Gettler\n    - B: Charles Norris\n    - C: Albert Einstein\n    - D: Sigmund Freud\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the state of the coroner system in New York City in the early 20th century?\n    - A: Efficient and accurate\n    - B: Corrupt and often inaccurate\n    - C: Understaffed and underfunded\n    - D: Overstaffed and overfunded\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was the significance of Charles Norris and Alexander Gettler's appointments in 1918?\n    - A: They marked the end of forensic science in the US\n    - B: They marked a significant turning point in the development of forensic science in the US\n    - C: They had no impact on the development of forensic science\n    - D: They were irrelevant to the field of forensic science\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How has the development of forensic science impacted the investigation of crimes involving poison?\n    - A: It has made it more difficult to detect poison-related crimes\n    - B: It has had no impact on the investigation of poison-related crimes\n    - C: It has led to a greater understanding of the effects of poison and its detection\n    - D: It has only been useful in solving minor crimes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What has been the result of the collaboration between scientists and law enforcement in the investigation of crimes?\n    - A: A decrease in the accuracy of death certificates\n    - B: An increase in the number of unsolved crimes\n    - C: An improvement in the accuracy of death certificates and the investigation of crimes\n    - D: No impact on the investigation of crimes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What was the primary cause of the high rate of unsolved crimes and inaccurate death certificates in the early 20th century?\n    - A: The lack of funding for law enforcement\n    - B: The corrupt coroner system and lack of understanding about poison\n    - C: The lack of trained medical examiners\n    - D: The limited use of forensic science\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How has the development of forensic science impacted the approach to crime scenes and investigations?\n    - A: It has led to a more disorganized approach to crime scenes\n    - B: It has had no impact on the approach to crime scenes\n    - C: It has led to a shift in the way police approach crime scenes and investigations\n    - D: It has only been useful in solving minor crimes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What has been the result of the collaboration between scientists and law enforcement in terms of the development of new techniques and technologies?\n    - A: A decrease in the development of new techniques and technologies\n    - B: No impact on the development of new techniques and technologies\n    - C: An increase in the development of new techniques and technologies for detecting and analyzing evidence\n    - D: Only minor improvements in the development of new techniques and technologies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What was the significance of the case solved by Alexander Gettler in 1923?\n    - A: It marked the end of forensic science in the US\n    - B: It was a minor case with no impact on the development of forensic science\n    - C: It was a significant case that demonstrated the importance of forensic science in solving crimes\n    - D: It was irrelevant to the field of forensic science\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) How has the use of forensic science impacted the accuracy of investigations and the sense of justice?\n    - A: It has led to a decrease in the accuracy of investigations and a sense of injustice\n    - B: It has had no impact on the accuracy of investigations and the sense of justice\n    - C: It has led to an improvement in the accuracy of investigations and a greater sense of justice\n    - D: It has only been useful in solving minor crimes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What was the impact of the corrupt coroner system on the investigation of crimes in the early 20th century?\n    - A: It had a minor impact on the investigation of crimes\n    - B: It had a significant impact on the investigation of crimes, leading to inaccurate death certificates and unsolved crimes\n    - C: It had no impact on the investigation of crimes\n    - D: It was irrelevant to the investigation of crimes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-5 and 7-12. However, I made minor adjustments to questions 6 and added a new question 10 to make it more specific and relevant to the transcript."
