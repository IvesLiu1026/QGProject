    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of sensory neurons are responsible for detecting spiciness in food?\n    - A: Mechanoreceptors\n    - B: Thermoreceptors\n    - C: Polymodal nociceptors\n    - D: Chemoreceptors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the Scoville heat unit measurement for a sweet bell pepper?\n    - A: 100-200 units\n    - B: 1,200-2,400 units\n    - C: 0 units\n    - D: 1.5-2 million units\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary concept related to the sensation of spiciness?\n    - A: The activation of sound-sensitive receptors\n    - B: The activation of heat-sensitive receptors, triggering a fight-or-flight response\n    - C: The activation of light-sensitive receptors\n    - D: The activation of smell-sensitive receptors\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary purpose of the Scoville scale?\n    - A: To measure the nutritional value of foods\n    - B: To measure the spiciness of foods\n    - C: To measure the temperature of foods\n    - D: To measure the texture of foods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How does the type of compound in spicy food affect the sensation of spiciness?\n    - A: Alkylamides and isothiocyanates produce the same sensation of spiciness\n    - B: Alkylamides produce a more intense sensation of spiciness than isothiocyanates\n    - C: The type of compound (alkylamides vs. isothiocyanates) affects the location and sensation of spiciness\n    - D: The type of compound has no impact on the sensation of spiciness\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential reason why humans started adding spices to food?\n    - A: To enhance the flavor of food\n    - B: To kill off bacteria in food\n    - C: To add color to food\n    - D: To reduce the nutritional value of food\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How do people who regularly eat spicy food perceive the pain associated with it?\n    - A: They rate the pain as less intense over time\n    - B: They become desensitized to the pain\n    - C: They rate the pain as equally intense, but learn to enjoy it\n    - D: They experience no pain at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between the Scoville scale and the perceived spiciness of food?\n    - A: The Scoville scale is a direct measure of perceived spiciness\n    - B: The Scoville scale is an indirect measure of perceived spiciness\n    - C: The Scoville scale is not related to perceived spiciness\n    - D: The Scoville scale is only relevant to certain types of spicy food\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How does understanding the science behind spiciness help individuals appreciate spicy foods?\n    - A: It helps them avoid spicy foods altogether\n    - B: It helps them appreciate the differences between various spicy foods\n    - C: It helps them prepare only extremely spicy dishes\n    - D: It helps them ignore the Scoville scale\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be gained by integrating the psychological and physiological aspects of enjoying spicy food?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and the reasons behind enjoying spicy food\n    - B: A better understanding of the Scoville scale\n    - C: A deeper appreciation for non-spicy food\n    - D: A complete avoidance of spicy food\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I also refined questions 5, 6, 7, and 8 to enhance clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I confirmed that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
