What might they do?\n    - A: Use zirconium as a fuel source\n    - B: Use a different cladding material that is less reactive with steam\n    - C: Increase the temperature of the reactor\n    - D: Decrease the pressure of the reactor\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A researcher wants to use zirconium oxide as a material in a new application. What might they use it for?\n    - A: As a conductor\n    - B: As a semiconductor\n    - C: As a ceramic\n    - D: As a catalyst\n[Correct answer]: C (Note: Zirconium oxide can be used as a ceramic or a catalyst, but ceramic is a more specific and correct answer)\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is a key similarity between zirconium and hafnium that makes them challenging to separate?\n    - A: They have similar atomic masses\n    - B: They have similar chemical properties\n    - C: They have similar electron configurations\n    - D: They have similar physical properties\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a potential trade-off of using zirconium as a cladding material in nuclear reactors?\n    - A: It is very expensive\n    - B: It is very heavy\n    - C: It can react with steam and produce hydrogen\n    - D: It is not very effective at preventing the fuel from coming into contact with the coolant\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) A researcher wants to design a new material that combines the properties of zirconium and another element. What might they create?\n    - A: A new metal alloy that is highly reactive with steam\n    - B: A new ceramic material that is highly resistant to corrosion\n    - C: A new catalyst that is highly effective at promoting chemical reactions\n    - D: A new semiconductor material that is highly efficient at conducting electricity\n[Correct answer]: B (Note: This question requires the test-taker to think creatively and come up with a plausible new material that combines the properties of zirconium and another element)\n\n2) A nuclear engineer wants to integrate zirconium into a new technology. What might they use it for?\n    - A: As a fuel source in a new type of nuclear reactor\n    - B: As a cladding material in a new type of nuclear reactor\n    - C: As a component in a new type of energy storage system\n    - D: As a component in a new type of medical device\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is a potential risk of using zirconium as a cladding material in nuclear reactors?\n    - A: It can react with steam and produce hydrogen\n    - B: It is very expensive\n    - C: It is very heavy\n    - D: It is not very effective at preventing the fuel from coming into contact with the coolant\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) A researcher wants to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods for separating zirconium from hafnium. What criteria might they use?\n    - A: Cost, efficiency, and purity of the final product\n    - B: Cost, efficiency, and yield of the final product\n    - C: Purity of the final product, yield of the final product, and environmental impact\n    - D: Efficiency, purity of the final product, and simplicity of the process\n[Correct answer]: A"
