    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the origin of the name \"bromine\"?\n    - A: From the Greek word \"bromos,\" meaning stench\n    - B: From the Latin word \"bromus,\" meaning red\n    - C: From the Greek word \"chloros,\" meaning green\n    - D: From the Latin word \"fluor,\" meaning flow\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Where is bromine commonly found in concentrated solutions?\n    - A: In the Dead Sea\n    - B: In the Red Sea\n    - C: In the Mediterranean Sea\n    - D: In the Pacific Ocean\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What distinguishes bromine from other elements?\n    - A: Its solid state and pleasant smell\n    - B: Its liquid state and unpleasant smell\n    - C: Its gas state and neutral smell\n    - D: Its high melting point\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the result of the reaction between bromine and aluminum?\n    - A: The production of aluminum oxide\n    - B: The production of aluminum tribromide and release of energy\n    - C: The production of aluminum chloride\n    - D: The production of aluminum fluoride\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a common use of bromine in the production of plastics?\n    - A: To make them more flammable\n    - B: To make them less flammable\n    - C: To make them more flexible\n    - D: To make them more rigid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What type of reaction is demonstrated by the reaction between bromine and aluminum?\n    - A: Reduction reaction\n    - B: Oxidation reaction\n    - C: Acid-base reaction\n    - D: Precipitation reaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is unique about bromine's isotopic composition?\n    - A: It has only one isotope\n    - B: It has two isotopes with significantly different masses\n    - C: It has two isotopes with almost equal quantities in nature\n    - D: It has multiple isotopes with varying masses\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does bromine's reactivity compare to that of chlorine?\n    - A: Bromine is more reactive than chlorine\n    - B: Bromine is less reactive than chlorine\n    - C: Bromine and chlorine have similar reactivity\n    - D: Bromine and chlorine have opposite reactivity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be observed when bromine reacts with aluminum?\n    - A: A slow and endothermic reaction\n    - B: A fast and exothermic reaction\n    - C: A neutral and non-reactive interaction\n    - D: A slow and non-reactive interaction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What should be considered when evaluating the safety risks associated with handling bromine?\n    - A: Only its toxicity\n    - B: Only its reactivity\n    - C: Both its toxicity and reactivity\n    - D: Neither its toxicity nor reactivity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a key factor in bromine's safety profile compared to chlorine?\n    - A: Its higher reactivity\n    - B: Its lower reactivity\n    - C: Its liquid state at room temperature\n    - D: Its gas state at room temperature\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a common application of bromine in everyday products?\n    - A: In the production of food packaging\n    - B: In the production of plastics for electronics\n    - C: In the production of flame retardants for plastics\n    - D: In the production of medical equipment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made some changes to enhance clarity and conciseness, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also rephrased some questions to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
