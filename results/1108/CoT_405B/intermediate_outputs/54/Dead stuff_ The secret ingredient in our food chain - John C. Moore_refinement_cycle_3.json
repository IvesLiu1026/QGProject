What would be an effective way to do this?\n    - A: Adding more pesticides to the soil\n    - B: Incorporating detritus into the soil through composting\n    - C: Reducing the amount of water used for irrigation\n    - D: Increasing the amount of synthetic fertilizers used\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A conservationist wants to restore a degraded ecosystem. What would be a crucial step in this process?\n    - A: Introducing invasive species to the ecosystem\n    - B: Removing detritus from the ecosystem\n    - C: Promoting decomposition and nutrient cycling\n    - D: Reducing the amount of sunlight entering the ecosystem\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between the green food chain and the brown food chain?\n    - A: They are two separate and independent food chains.\n    - B: The green food chain is a subset of the brown food chain.\n    - C: The brown food chain is a subset of the green food chain.\n    - D: They are interconnected and interdependent food chains.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the effect of decomposing detritus on ecosystem productivity?\n    - A: It leads to a decrease in ecosystem productivity.\n    - B: It has no impact on ecosystem productivity.\n    - C: It leads to an increase in ecosystem productivity.\n    - D: It leads to a decrease in biodiversity.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How are human food sources connected to detritus?\n    - A: Humans only consume food from the green food chain.\n    - B: Humans only consume food from the brown food chain.\n    - C: Humans consume food from both the green and brown food chains, which are connected through detritus.\n    - D: Humans do not consume food that is connected to detritus.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What concept is illustrated by the idea that one organism's waste can be another's energy source?\n    - A: The law of conservation of energy\n    - B: The concept of symbiosis\n    - C: The concept of food webs\n    - D: The interconnectedness of ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) Why is decomposition important in natural ecosystems?\n    - A: It leads to a decrease in ecosystem productivity.\n    - B: It has no impact on ecosystem productivity.\n    - C: It leads to an increase in ecosystem productivity and supports the food web.\n    - D: It leads to a decrease in biodiversity.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the role of detritus in supporting ecosystems and the food chain?\n    - A: Detritus is only a minor component of ecosystems.\n    - B: Detritus is only important for certain species.\n    - C: Detritus is a critical component of ecosystems, providing energy and nutrients for many organisms.\n    - D: Detritus has no impact on ecosystems or the food chain.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
