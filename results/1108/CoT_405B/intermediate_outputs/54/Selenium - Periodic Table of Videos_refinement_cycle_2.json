Which element would be a suitable choice?\n    - A: Sulphur\n    - B: Selenium\n    - C: Oxygen\n    - D: Nitrogen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A person is experiencing dandruff and is looking for a shampoo that can help treat the condition. What type of shampoo would be a good option?\n    - A: One containing only sulphur\n    - B: One containing a combination of sulphur and selenium\n    - C: One containing oxygen\n    - D: One containing nitrogen\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How do the molecular structures of selenium and sulphur differ?\n    - A: Selenium exists in S8 rings, while sulphur exists in long chains\n    - B: Selenium exists in long chains, while sulphur exists in S8 rings\n    - C: Selenium and sulphur both exist in S8 rings\n    - D: Selenium and sulphur both exist in long chains\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between selenium's conductivity and its use in photo cells?\n    - A: Selenium's conductivity is not related to its use in photo cells\n    - B: Selenium's conductivity when exposed to light makes it suitable for use in photo cells\n    - C: Selenium's conductivity when exposed to heat makes it suitable for use in photo cells\n    - D: Selenium's conductivity when exposed to sound makes it suitable for use in photo cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) This question has been removed as it was not specific enough.\n\n10) A company is looking to develop new applications for selenium-based materials in the field of renewable energy. What type of device could be a potential application?\n    - A: Solar panels\n    - B: Wind turbines\n    - C: Hydroelectric dams\n    - D: Geothermal power plants\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential drawback of taking selenium as a dietary supplement?\n    - A: Its high cost\n    - B: Its potential to cause unpleasant body odor\n    - C: Its low effectiveness\n    - D: Its high reactivity with other elements\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) A person is considering taking selenium as a dietary supplement. What should they do before making a decision?\n    - A: Consult with a doctor\n    - B: Read online reviews\n    - C: Ask friends for advice\n    - D: Start taking the supplement immediately\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
