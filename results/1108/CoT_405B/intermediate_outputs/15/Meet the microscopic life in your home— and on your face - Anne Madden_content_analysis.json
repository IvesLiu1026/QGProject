Thousands of microscopic creatures live on our faces and fingers.\n2. 100 billion bacterial cells live on our skin.\n3. Fecal bacteria can be found on our skin, possibly from toilet flushing or water pipes.\n4. Two species of mites live on our faces.\n5. Over 600 species of bugs live in USA homes.\n6. Over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi live in our dust bunnies.\n7. Microorganisms can be found inside the bodies of bugs in our homes.\n8. Many microorganisms remain unknown and unnamed.\n9. The speaker discovered a new fungus species, \"mucor nidicola\", which lives in the nest of a paper wasp.\n\n**Comprehension** (Important concepts that require understanding or interpretation):\n1. The concept of microscopic life existing all around us, even on our own bodies.\n2. The idea that humans have had an adversarial relationship with microscopic life for the past 100 years.\n3. The shift in perspective from viewing microorganisms as problems to be eradicated to seeing them as potential solutions to human problems.\n4. The diversity of life in our homes and environments is a rich source of new technologies and solutions.\n5. Microorganisms have the ability to transform their environment and produce valuable products.\n\n**Application** (Scenarios or real-world applications where the content can be applied):\n1.
