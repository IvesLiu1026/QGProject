Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary driver of climate change?\n    - A: Natural climate variability\n    - B: Human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation\n    - C: Solar radiation and volcanic eruptions\n    - D: Changes in Earth's orbit\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the name of the international agreement signed in 2015 to address global climate change?\n    - A: The Kyoto Protocol\n    - B: The Paris Agreement\n    - C: The Copenhagen Accord\n    - D: The Montreal Protocol\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the expected impact of rising sea levels on coastal areas?\n    - A: Increased biodiversity and improved water quality\n    - B: Reduced risk of droughts and heatwaves\n    - C: Coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion\n    - D: Improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does climate change affect ecosystems?\n    - A: Increases stability and resilience\n    - B: Reduces biodiversity and disrupts ecosystem services\n    - C: Improves air quality and enhances water cycles\n    - D: Has no significant impact on ecosystems\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can individuals do to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change?\n    - A: Increase energy consumption and use more fossil fuels\n    - B: Reduce meat consumption, use public transport, and increase energy efficiency\n    - C: Use more water and reduce recycling\n    - D: Increase air travel and reduce use of renewable energy sources\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential consequence of not transitioning to renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions?\n    - A: Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality\n    - B: Increased energy security and reduced energy costs\n    - C: More frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms\n    - D: Improved water quality and reduced risk of flooding\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between climate change and biodiversity?\n    - A: Climate change has no significant impact on biodiversity\n    - B: Climate change leads to increased biodiversity and ecosystem resilience\n    - C: Climate change has a negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services\n    - D: Climate change has a neutral impact on biodiversity\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the cause-and-effect connection between burning fossil fuels and climate change?\n    - A: Burning fossil fuels reduces greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates climate change\n    - B: Burning fossil fuels has no significant impact on climate change\n    - C: Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, leading to climate change\n    - D: Burning fossil fuels improves air quality and reduces the risk of heatwaves\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change on coastal communities?\n    - A: Building sea walls and increasing coastal development\n    - B: Implementing sustainable agriculture practices and reducing deforestation\n    - C: Developing climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting eco-tourism, and supporting climate change adaptation\n    - D: Increasing fossil fuel consumption and reducing energy efficiency\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can governments, organizations, and individuals work together to address climate change?\n    - A: By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable land use\n    - B: By increasing energy consumption, promoting deforestation, and reducing recycling\n    - C: By implementing climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and supporting climate change adaptation\n    - D: By reducing meat consumption, using public transport, and increasing energy efficiency\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is the justification for transitioning to renewable energy sources?\n    - A: To reduce energy costs and increase energy security\n    - B: To improve air quality and reduce the risk of heatwaves\n    - C: To mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development\n    - D: To increase energy consumption and reduce recycling\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the critique of the current global response to climate change?\n    - A: It is too ambitious and unrealistic, and may lead to economic disruption\n    - B: It is too slow and inadequate, and may not meet the goals of the Paris Agreement\n    - C: It is too expensive and economically unfeasible, and may lead to increased energy costs\n    - D: It is too focused on mitigation and not enough on adaptation, and may not address the root causes of climate change\n[Correct answer]: B"
