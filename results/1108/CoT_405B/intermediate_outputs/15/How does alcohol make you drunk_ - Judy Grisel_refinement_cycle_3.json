    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary active ingredient in alcoholic beverages responsible for causing drunkenness?\n    - A: Acetate\n    - B: Ethanol\n    - C: Acetaldehyde\n    - D: Glutamate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) How does eating a big meal affect the level of alcohol that reaches the blood compared to drinking on an empty stomach?\n    - A: It remains the same\n    - B: It doubles\n    - C: It increases by a quarter\n    - D: It decreases to a quarter\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary function of the enzyme ADH in the liver's breakdown of alcohol?\n    - A: To convert acetaldehyde to acetate\n    - B: To convert alcohol to acetaldehyde\n    - C: To convert acetate to acetaldehyde\n    - D: To convert acetaldehyde to alcohol\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the effect of alcohol on the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate in the brain?\n    - A: It turns down GABA and turns up glutamate\n    - B: It turns up GABA and turns down glutamate\n    - C: It has no effect on GABA and glutamate\n    - D: It turns down both GABA and glutamate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) What happens when the liver's breakdown of alcohol outpaces the brain's absorption?\n    - A: Drunkenness intensifies\n    - B: Drunkenness fades away\n    - C: The body becomes more sensitive to alcohol\n    - D: The body becomes less sensitive to alcohol\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n6) Why do women generally have higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) than men after drinking the same amount?\n    - A: Women have more blood volume than men\n    - B: Women have less blood volume than men due to a higher percentage of fat\n    - C: Women have the same blood volume as men\n    - D: Women have a lower percentage of fat than men\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) How does regular drinking affect the production of liver enzymes that process alcohol?\n    - A: It decreases production\n    - B: It has no effect on production\n    - C: It increases production\n    - D: It stops production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the result of the brain adapting to chronic alcohol consumption?\n    - A: It increases GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission\n    - B: It reduces GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, and enhances glutamate activity\n    - C: It has no effect on neurotransmitter transmission\n    - D: It decreases glutamate activity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\nHowever, I suggest adding more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript. Here are some additional questions:\n\n9) What is the role of the enzyme ALDH in the liver's breakdown of alcohol?\n    - A: To convert acetaldehyde to acetate\n    - B: To convert alcohol to acetaldehyde\n    - C: To convert acetate to acetaldehyde\n    - D: To convert acetaldehyde to alcohol\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How does alcohol affect the release of endorphins in the brain?\n    - A: It decreases the release of endorphins\n    - B: It has no effect on the release of endorphins\n    - C: It increases the release of endorphins\n    - D: It stops the release of endorphins\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the effect of genetic differences in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission on the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder?\n    - A: It decreases the risk\n    - B: It has no effect on the risk\n    - C: It increases the risk\n    - D: It stops the risk\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How does the brain's adaptation to chronic alcohol consumption contribute to disordered drinking?\n    - A: It reduces the desire to drink\n    - B: It has no effect on the desire to drink\n    - C: It increases the desire to drink\n    - D: It stops the desire to drink\n[Correct answer]: C"
