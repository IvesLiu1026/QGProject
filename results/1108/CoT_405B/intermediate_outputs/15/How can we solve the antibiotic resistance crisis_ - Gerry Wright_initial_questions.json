A more accurate answer would be \"integrating phages and vaccines into antibiotic development,\" but that is not a concise option.)\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is a justification for increased investment in antibiotic development and research?\n    - A: The current antibiotic pipeline is sufficient\n    - B: The threat of resistant bacteria is overstated\n    - C: The development of new antibiotics is not cost-effective\n    - D: The rise of resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to public health\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is a critique of the role of pharmaceutical companies in the development and marketing of antibiotics?\n    - A: They prioritize profit over public health\n    - B: They invest sufficient resources in antibiotic development\n    - C: They effectively balance profit and public health\n    - D: They have no impact on the development and marketing of antibiotics\n[Correct answer]: A"
