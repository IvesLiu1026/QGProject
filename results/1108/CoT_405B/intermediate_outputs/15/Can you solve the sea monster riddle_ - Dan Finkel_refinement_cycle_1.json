    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) How many Leviathan Lords are threatening the city of Atlantartica?\n    - A: 5\n    - B: 7\n    - C: 10\n    - D: 12\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the least common multiple of 7, 11, and 13?\n    - A: 100\n    - B: 500\n    - C: 1001\n    - D: 2000\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) Why must the division of pearls among the sea monsters be done in a specific way?\n    - A: To ensure each sea monster gets an equal share\n    - B: To avoid leftover pearls, which would lead to the city's doom\n    - C: To make the sea monsters happy\n    - D: To follow an ancient tradition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens when you multiply 1001 by a three-digit number?\n    - A: The result is always an even number\n    - B: The result is always a prime number\n    - C: The original number is repeated in a peculiar pattern\n    - D: The result is always a negative number\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) How can the concept of divisibility by 7, 11, and 13 be applied in real-world scenarios?\n    - A: Only in cryptography\n    - B: Only in coding theory\n    - C: In division of resources or quantities\n    - D: Only in mathematics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What problem-solving strategy can be applied to various mathematical or scientific problems?\n    - A: Trying concrete examples to gain intuition\n    - B: Using patterns to decode unknown numeral systems\n    - C: Dividing resources or quantities\n    - D: Using cryptography\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between the number of pearls, the Leviathan Lords, kraken, and mermites?\n    - A: The number of pearls must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13\n    - B: The number of pearls must be equal to the number of sea monsters\n    - C: The number of pearls must be greater than the number of sea monsters\n    - D: The number of pearls must be less than the number of sea monsters\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What is the significance of the pattern resulting from multiplying 1001 by a three-digit number?\n    - A: It is a random pattern\n    - B: It is a prime number pattern\n    - C: It is a pattern that repeats the original number\n    - D: It is a pattern that has no significance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be created by combining the concepts of divisibility, patterns, and problem-solving strategies?\n    - A: A new approach to cryptography\n    - B: A new understanding of how to approach similar problems\n    - C: A new mathematical theorem\n    - D: A new scientific theory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be said about the effectiveness of the problem-solving strategy used to find the correct chest?\n    - A: It is ineffective because it relies on trial and error\n    - B: It is effective because it uses patterns to decode the unknown numeral system\n    - C: It is ineffective because it does not use cryptography\n    - D: It is effective because it uses divisibility to find the correct chest\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were similar to questions 9 and 8, respectively. I also rephrased some questions to make them more concise and clear. No more refinement needed."
