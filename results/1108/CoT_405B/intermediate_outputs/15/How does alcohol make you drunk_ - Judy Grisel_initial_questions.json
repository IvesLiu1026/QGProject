A person who has eaten a large meal may experience:\n    - A: Increased effects of alcohol due to faster absorption into the bloodstream\n    - B: Reduced effects of alcohol due to slower absorption into the bloodstream\n    - C: No change in the effects of alcohol\n    - D: Withdrawal symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. A person with a family history of alcoholism may be more prone to developing an alcohol use disorder due to:\n    - A: Genetic differences in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission\n    - B: Environmental factors such as peer pressure\n    - C: A combination of genetic and environmental factors\n    - D: A lack of access to treatment\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1. What determines the level of intoxication in an individual?\n    - A: The liver's breakdown of alcohol alone\n    - B: The brain's absorption of alcohol alone\n    - C: The relationship between the liver's breakdown of alcohol and the brain's absorption of alcohol\n    - D: The rate of kidney filtration\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. Why do women generally experience higher BACs than men?\n    - A: Due to a larger blood volume\n    - B: Due to a smaller blood volume\n    - C: Due to a higher rate of liver metabolism\n    - D: Due to a lower rate of kidney filtration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. What can lead to changes in the brain's neurotransmitter systems and increase the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder?\n    - A: Genetic factors alone\n    - B: Environmental factors alone\n    - C: The combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as regular drinking\n    - D: A lack of access to treatment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2. What can lead to varying levels of intoxication and affect the development of tolerance?\n    - A: The liver's breakdown of alcohol alone\n    - B: The brain's absorption of alcohol alone\n    - C: The interaction between the liver's breakdown of alcohol and the brain's absorption of alcohol\n    - D: The rate of kidney filtration\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1. What is a potential consequence of chronic alcohol consumption on the brain and body?\n    - A: Improved cognitive function\n    - B: Increased risk of developing an alcohol use disorder\n    - C: Reduced risk of developing an alcohol use disorder\n    - D: No significant effects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2. Why is it important to consider individual differences in the body's processing of alcohol when assessing the risks and effects of drinking?\n    - A: Because individual differences have no impact on the risks and effects of drinking\n    - B: Because individual differences can lead to varying levels of intoxication and affect the development of tolerance\n    - C: Because individual differences can lead to a reduced risk of developing an alcohol use disorder\n    - D: Because individual differences can lead to improved cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: B"
