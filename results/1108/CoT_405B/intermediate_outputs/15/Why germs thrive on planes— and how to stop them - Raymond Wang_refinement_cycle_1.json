    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many people travel by plane every year?\n    - A: Over 1 billion\n    - B: Over 2 billion\n    - C: Over 3 billion\n    - D: Over 4 billion\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What types of diseases can be spread on airplanes, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Only viral diseases\n    - B: Only bacterial diseases\n    - C: Diseases like Ebola, H1N1, and SARS\n    - D: Only fungal diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What sparked the speaker's interest in the topic of disease transmission on airplanes?\n    - A: Learning about the SARS epidemic\n    - B: Learning about the Ebola outbreak\n    - C: Conducting research on airplane cabins\n    - D: Reading about computational fluid dynamics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the Global Inlet Director work to reduce disease transmission?\n    - A: By creating a single airflow pattern throughout the cabin\n    - B: By creating walls of air that come down between passengers to create personalized breathing zones\n    - C: By filtering out all pathogens from the air\n    - D: By reducing the amount of fresh air in the cabin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential benefit of installing the Global Inlet Director?\n    - A: Reducing the transmission of diseases on airplanes\n    - B: Increasing the air pressure in airplane cabins\n    - C: Decreasing the amount of fresh air in airplane cabins\n    - D: Creating a single airflow pattern throughout the cabin\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What is an advantage of the Global Inlet Director in terms of installation?\n    - A: It requires significant modifications to existing airplane cabins\n    - B: It can be installed overnight and is cost-effective\n    - C: It only works on new airplane models\n    - D: It reduces the amount of fresh air in the cabin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the mixing airflow pattern in conventional airplane cabins affect the spread of pathogens?\n    - A: It reduces the spread of pathogens\n    - B: It has no effect on the spread of pathogens\n    - C: It can cause pathogens to spread to multiple people before being filtered out\n    - D: It only affects the spread of viral diseases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a key difference between the conventional cabin and the cabin with the Global Inlet Director installed?\n    - A: The conventional cabin has a single airflow pattern, while the cabin with the Global Inlet Director has a mixing airflow pattern\n    - B: The conventional cabin has a mixing airflow pattern, while the cabin with the Global Inlet Director has personalized breathing zones\n    - C: The conventional cabin has more fresh air, while the cabin with the Global Inlet Director has less fresh air\n    - D: The conventional cabin has less fresh air, while the cabin with the Global Inlet Director has more fresh air\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What technologies did the speaker use to create simulations of airflow patterns in airplane cabins?\n    - A: Computational fluid dynamics and 2D modeling\n    - B: Computational fluid dynamics and 3D modeling\n    - C: Experimental testing and 2D modeling\n    - D: Experimental testing and 3D modeling\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential integration of the Global Inlet Director?\n    - A: Integrating it into new airplane models only\n    - B: Integrating it into existing airplane cabins to create a more efficient and effective system\n    - C: Integrating it into hospitals only\n    - D: Integrating it into public transportation only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What was the estimated economic impact of the SARS epidemic?\n    - A: $10 billion\n    - B: $20 billion\n    - C: $30 billion\n    - D: $40 billion\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What are the benefits of installing the Global Inlet Director, according to the speaker?\n    - A: Reducing the amount of fresh air in the cabin\n    - B: Increasing the risk of disease transmission\n    - C: Reducing pathogen transmission and increasing fresh-air inhalation\n    - D: Having no effect on disease transmission\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor changes to the questions to improve clarity and concision, while ensuring that the correct answers and distractors remain accurate and plausible. No more refinement needed."
