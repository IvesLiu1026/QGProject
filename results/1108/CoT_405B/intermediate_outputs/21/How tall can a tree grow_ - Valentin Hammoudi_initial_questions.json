A: They work together to distribute necessary substances throughout the tree\n    - B: They work independently to regulate different aspects of tree growth\n    - C: Phloem sap is more important for tree growth, while xylem sap is secondary\n    - D: Xylem sap is more important for tree growth, while phloem sap is secondary\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between tree height and the dwindling supply of vital fluids?\n    - A: As trees grow taller, the supply of vital fluids increases, allowing for continued growth.\n    - B: As trees grow taller, the supply of vital fluids remains constant, and growth is unaffected.\n    - C: As trees grow taller, the supply of vital fluids dwindles, and the tree eventually stops growing.\n    - D: As trees grow taller, the supply of vital fluids becomes irrelevant, and growth is determined by other factors.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1) What new insights can be gained by integrating the concepts of sap circulation, hydraulic limitation, and gravity's role in shaping tree growth?\n    -
