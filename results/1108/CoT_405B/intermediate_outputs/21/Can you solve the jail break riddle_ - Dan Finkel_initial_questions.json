    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n1) What are the fuses made of, and how long do they burn for?\n    - A: Flammable paper, 30 seconds\n    - B: Flammable twine, 1 minute\n    - C: Electric wire, 2 minutes\n    - D: Plastic fiber, 45 seconds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What happens to the electric fence circuit after a short period of time?\n    - A: It stays off permanently\n    - B: It takes 45 seconds to restart\n    - C: It restarts after a second or two\n    - D: It malfunctions and sparks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension**\n1) What is the key insight to solving the timing problem using the fuses and lighter?\n    - A: Cutting the fuses in half guarantees even burning\n    - B: Lighting a fuse from both ends simultaneously will double its burning time\n    - C: Lighting a fuse from both ends simultaneously will halve its burning time\n    - D: The fuses' length guarantees even burning\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the problem that requires finding a way to time exactly 45 seconds using the fuses and lighter?\n    - A: To fix a broken clock\n    - B: To time a recipe in a cookbook\n    - C: To escape a high-pressure situation like a prison break\n    - D: To conduct a science experiment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application**\n1) In what type of situation could the technique of using the fuses and lighter to time 45 seconds be applied?\n    - A: Only in a prison break scenario\n    - B: Any situation where precise timing is crucial, and conventional timing methods are unavailable\n    - C: Only in a science laboratory setting\n    - D: Only in a cooking competition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What could be a real-world application of using the fuses and lighter to time 45 seconds?\n    - A: Escaping a high-pressure situation like a prison break\n    - B: Conducting a science experiment in a laboratory\n    - C: Timing a recipe in a cooking competition\n    - D: Fixing a broken clock\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Analysis**\n1) What is the relationship between the fuses' burning time and their length?\n    - A: The fuses burn for 60 seconds from end to end, and cutting them in half guarantees even burning\n    - B: The fuses burn for 60 seconds from end to end, but cutting them in half does not guarantee even burning\n    - C: The fuses burn for 30 seconds from end to end, and cutting them in half guarantees even burning\n    - D: The fuses burn for 30 seconds from end to end, but cutting them in half does not guarantee even burning\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection when lighting the fuses from both ends simultaneously?\n    - A: The fuses will burn out in double the time\n    - B: The fuses will burn out in half the time\n    - C: The fuses will burn out in the same amount of time\n    - D: The fuses will not burn at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n1) How can the ideas of lighting a fuse from both ends and using two fuses be combined to achieve the desired time of 45 seconds?\n    - A: Using one fuse to time 45 seconds\n    - B: Using the first fuse to time 30 seconds and the second fuse to time the remaining 15 seconds\n    - C: Using the first fuse to time 15 seconds and the second fuse to time the remaining 30 seconds\n    - D: Using two fuses to time 60 seconds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a possible way to use the fuses to time 45 seconds?\n    - A: Cutting one fuse in half and lighting it from one end\n    - B: Lighting one fuse from both ends and using a second fuse to time the remaining time\n    - C: Using one fuse to time 30 seconds and then estimating the remaining 15 seconds\n    - D: Using two fuses to time 60 seconds and then subtracting 15 seconds\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n1) Is using the fuses and lighter the best way to time 45 seconds in a high-pressure situation like a prison break?\n    - A: Yes, it is the most reliable method\n    - B: No, there are other more reliable methods available\n    - C: Maybe, it depends on the situation\n    - D: It is not possible to time 45 seconds using the fuses and lighter\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What assumption is made when using the fuses and lighter to time 45 seconds?\n    - A: The fuses will burn consistently when lit from one end\n    - B: The fuses will burn consistently when lit from both ends\n    - C: The fuses will not burn consistently when lit from either end\n    - D: The fuses will not burn at all\n[Correct answer]: B"
