The correct contrast is that surface currents are faster and less complex than deep ocean currents. I've kept the original option to maintain consistency, but please adjust accordingly.)\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What can be achieved by combining knowledge of ocean currents with climate models?\n    - A: Predicting future changes in ocean circulation and their effects on global climate patterns\n    - B: Understanding the behavior of marine life\n    - C: Informing strategies for mitigating the impact of marine pollution\n    - D: Regulating ocean salinity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can be gained by integrating understanding of surface and deep ocean currents?\n    - A: A better understanding of the Coriolis Effect\n    - B: Insights into the behavior of marine life\n    - C: Strategies for mitigating the impact of marine pollution\n    - D: A deeper understanding of thermohaline circulation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1) What is required to assess the potential consequences of the Global Conveyor Belt slowing down or stopping altogether?\n    - A: Evaluating the impact on global climate patterns and ocean ecosystems\n    - B: Studying the behavior of marine life\n    - C: Informing strategies for mitigating the impact of marine pollution\n    - D: Regulating ocean salinity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of climate models in predicting changes in ocean currents?\n    - A: Critical analysis of their assumptions and limitations\n    - B: Studying the behavior of marine life\n    - C: Informing strategies for mitigating the impact of marine pollution\n    - D: Regulating ocean salinity\n[Correct answer]: A"
