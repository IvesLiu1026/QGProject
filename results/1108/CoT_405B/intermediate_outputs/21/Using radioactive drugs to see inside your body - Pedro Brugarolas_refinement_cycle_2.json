    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is FDG commonly used to detect in medical diagnostics?\n    - A: Heart conditions\n    - B: Cancer, infections, and dementia\n    - C: Autoimmune diseases\n    - D: Genetic disorders\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of water is used as a target in a cyclotron to produce fluorine-18?\n    - A: Oxygen-16\n    - B: Oxygen-18\n    - C: Oxygen-20\n    - D: Deuterium\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What can the rate at which cells consume glucose signal in the body?\n    - A: The presence of cancer, infections, or dementia\n    - B: The onset of autoimmune diseases\n    - C: The progression of genetic disorders\n    - D: The development of heart conditions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n4) How do PET scans compare to other types of imaging in detecting cancer?\n    - A: They are less effective\n    - B: They are equally effective\n    - C: They can detect cancer before it can be spotted with other types of imaging\n    - D: They are only used for detecting dementia\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A patient is suspected to have cancer, and a doctor wants to use a PET scan to confirm the diagnosis. What would be the next step?\n    - A: Administering chemotherapy\n    - B: Conducting a biopsy\n    - C: Injecting the patient with a PET tracer, such as FDG\n    - D: Performing surgery\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a primary application of PET scan technology in the field of medicine?\n    - A: Developing new vaccines\n    - B: Diagnosing and treating various illnesses\n    - C: Studying the effects of climate change on human health\n    - D: Creating new prosthetic limbs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the cyclotron, oxygen-18, and fluorine-18 in producing PET tracers?\n    - A: The cyclotron uses oxygen-18 to produce fluorine-18, which is then attached to a molecule to create a PET tracer\n    - B: The cyclotron uses fluorine-18 to produce oxygen-18, which is then attached to a molecule to create a PET tracer\n    - C: The cyclotron uses oxygen-18 and fluorine-18 to produce a PET tracer\n    - D: The cyclotron is not involved in the production of PET tracers\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) How does the radiation exposure from a PET scan compare to natural radioactive sources or cosmic radiation?\n    - A: It is much higher\n    - B: It is much lower\n    - C: It is comparable to about two to three years of natural exposure or 20-30 transatlantic flights\n    - D: It is nonexistent\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of using PET scan technology in medical diagnostics?\n    - A: Reduced diagnostic accuracy\n    - B: Increased radiation exposure\n    - C: Improved diagnostic accuracy\n    - D: Higher costs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential use of PET scan data in medical research?\n    - A: Informing research on disease progression and treatment development\n    - B: Developing new vaccines\n    - C: Studying the effects of climate change on human health\n    - D: Creating new prosthetic limbs\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential justification for using PET scans in medical diagnostics despite the risks associated with radiation exposure?\n    - A: PET scans are the only diagnostic tool available\n    - B: The benefits of PET scans outweigh the risks\n    - C: PET scans are less expensive than other diagnostic tools\n    - D: PET scans are more widely available than other diagnostic tools\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a key criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of PET scans in detecting and treating various illnesses?\n    - A: The cost of the PET scan\n    - B: The availability of the PET scan\n    - C: The diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes\n    - D: The radiation exposure from the PET scan\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
