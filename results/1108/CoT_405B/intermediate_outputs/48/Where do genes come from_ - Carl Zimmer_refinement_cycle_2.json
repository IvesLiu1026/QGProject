Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many genes do humans have in their DNA?\n    - A: 10,000\n    - B: 20,000\n    - C: 30,000\n    - D: 40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What molecule do plants have that helps them make food from sunlight?\n    - A: Keratin\n    - B: Collagen\n    - C: Dopamine\n    - D: Chlorophyll\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What can happen to genes when they are duplicated and mutated?\n    - A: They become inactive and are deleted from the genome\n    - B: They remain unchanged and continue to perform the same function\n    - C: They can take on new functions and contribute to the evolution of new traits\n    - D: They are only expressed in specific tissues or organs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What type of genes did early life forms have?\n    - A: Genes for complex structures and specialized functions\n    - B: Basic genes for fundamental biological processes and survival\n    - C: Genes for advanced cognitive abilities and intelligence\n    - D: Genes for specialized senses and perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is the relationship between gene duplication and the emergence of new functions?\n    - A: Gene duplication leads to a loss of function and reduced fitness\n    - B: Gene duplication has no impact on function and does not contribute to evolution\n    - C: Gene duplication can lead to new functions and contribute to the evolution of new traits\n    - D: Gene duplication only occurs in response to environmental pressures and selection\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) How do the genetic makeups of humans and apes compare?\n    - A: They are identical and have not changed since the common ancestor\n    - B: They are very similar, but with some key differences and variations\n    - C: They are very different, with few similarities and many distinct features\n    - D: They are not comparable due to the complexity of the genomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What might happen to an organism's genes if it is exposed to a new environmental pressure?\n    - A: The genes will remain unchanged and not respond to the pressure\n    - B: The genes will mutate and become less functional, leading to reduced fitness\n    - C: The genes may duplicate and mutate, leading to new functions and adaptations\n    - D: The genes will be deleted from the genome, leading to a loss of function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the significance of genetic mutations in the emergence of new traits and functions?\n    - A: They are insignificant and do not contribute to evolution\n    - B: They are somewhat significant, but only in certain cases and under specific conditions\n    - C: They are very significant and play a key role in the evolution of new traits and functions\n    - D: They are the only factor that contributes to the emergence of new traits and functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How do scientists think life started on Earth?\n    - A: Through the emergence of complex organisms and ecosystems\n    - B: Through the creation of basic genes and primitive microbes\n    - C: Through the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities and intelligence\n    - D: Through the development of specialized senses and perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can happen to a gene that is duplicated and mutated over time?\n    - A: It will remain unchanged and continue to perform the same function\n    - B: It will become inactive and be deleted from the genome\n    - C: It can take on new functions and contribute to the evolution of new traits\n    - D: It will only be expressed in specific tissues or organs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is an example of a gene that has evolved to take on a new function?\n    - A: A gene for chlorophyll in plants\n    - B: A gene for keratin in humans\n    - C: A gene for venom in snakes\n    - D: A gene for dopamine in humans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is the role of random DNA sequences in the emergence of new genes?\n    - A: They are irrelevant and do not contribute to the emergence of new genes\n    - B: They can mutate and become functional genes\n    - C: They are only found in non-coding regions of the genome\n    - D: They are only found in coding regions of the genome\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) How long does it take for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes?\n    - A: A few thousand years\n    - B: A few million years\n    - C: Over a million years\n    - D: Instantaneously\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What is the result of gene duplication and mutation in the example of the snake venom gene?\n    - A: The gene became inactive and was deleted from the genome\n    - B: The gene remained unchanged and continued to perform the same function\n    - C: The gene took on a new function and contributed to the evolution of a new trait\n    - D: The gene was only expressed in specific tissues or organs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is the outcome of the process of gene duplication and mutation in the example of the human sense of smell?\n    - A: A reduced ability to perceive different smells\n    - B: An increased ability to perceive different smells\n    - C: No change in the ability to perceive different smells\n    - D: A loss of the sense of smell\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
