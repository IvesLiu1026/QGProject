A: Comets are just random lights in the sky with no connection to humanity or the Earth.\n    - B: Comets are a source of danger, potentially causing harm to humans and the planet.\n    - C: Comets have a deep connection to humanity and the Earth, potentially delivering life-building molecules.\n    - D: Comets are mere omens with no scientific significance.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the role of the solar wind in relation to comets?\n    - A: The solar wind has no effect on comets.\n    - B: The solar wind pushes comets away from the Sun.\n    - C: The solar wind pulls comets towards the Sun.\n    - D: The solar wind plays a crucial role in shaping comets and their tails.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) What can the study of comets provide insights into?\n    - A: The origins of the universe\n    - B: The formation of black holes\n    - C: The origins of life on Earth\n    - D: The composition of the Moon\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How can understanding comets and their composition inform the search for extraterrestrial life?\n    - A: By providing information on the potential dangers of comets\n    - B: By revealing the presence of water on other planets\n    - C: By identifying the types of organic molecules that comets can deliver to other planets\n    - D: By studying the atmospheric conditions on other planets\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between comets and the Solar System's formation?\n    - A: Comets formed after the Solar System was fully formed.\n    - B: Comets played no role in the Solar System's formation.\n    - C: Comets are leftovers from the formation of the Solar System.\n    - D: Comets were the primary building blocks of the Solar System.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the contrast between ancient views of comets and modern understanding of their role?\n    - A: Ancient views saw comets as benevolent signs, while modern understanding sees them as omens.\n    - B: Ancient views saw comets as omens, while modern understanding sees them as potentially delivering life-building molecules.\n    - C: Ancient views saw comets as random lights, while modern understanding sees them as connected to the Solar System's formation.\n    - D: Ancient views saw comets as connected to the Solar System's formation, while modern understanding sees them as random lights.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) What is the possible connection between comets, amino acids, and the emergence of life on Earth?\n    - A: Comets delivered amino acids to Earth, which then combined to form proteins, leading to the emergence of life.\n    - B: Comets delivered proteins to Earth, which then combined to form amino acids, leading to the emergence of life.\n    - C: Comets had no role in delivering amino acids or proteins to Earth.\n    - D: Comets delivered life-building molecules to other planets, but not to Earth.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the possible implication of comets delivering organic molecules to other planets?\n    - A: It would make the origins of life a unique phenomenon on Earth.\n    - B: It would make the origins of life a more universal phenomenon, potentially seeding life on other planets.\n    - C: It would have no impact on the origins of life on other planets.\n    - D: It would only lead to the emergence of simple life forms on other planets.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is the significance of continued research into comets and their composition?\n    - A: It is insignificant, as comets are just random lights in the sky.\n    - B: It is somewhat significant, as comets may provide insights into the Solar System's formation.\n    - C: It is highly significant, as comets may hold the key to understanding the emergence of life on Earth and potentially elsewhere.\n    - D: It is only significant for understanding the composition of the Solar System.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the implication of comets delivering organic molecules to other planets in terms of the potential for extraterrestrial life?\n    - A: It would make the existence of extraterrestrial life highly unlikely.\n    - B: It would have no impact on the potential for extraterrestrial life.\n    - C: It would make the existence of extraterrestrial life more plausible.\n    - D: It would only lead to the emergence of simple life forms on other planets.\n[Correct answer]: C"
