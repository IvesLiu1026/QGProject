    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript and the initial questions, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the primary functions of vitamins in the human body?\n    - A: To regulate body temperature and blood pressure\n    - B: To build muscle and bone, make use of nutrients, capture and use energy, and heal wounds\n    - C: To provide energy and oxygen to cells exclusively\n    - D: To support immune function only\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which type of vitamins are typically found dissolved in the watery parts of fruits, vegetables, and grains?\n    - A: Lipid-soluble vitamins\n    - B: Water-soluble vitamins\n    - C: Fat-soluble vitamins\n    - D: Carbohydrate-soluble vitamins\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How do fat-soluble vitamins enter the bloodstream?\n    - A: They are dissolved in water and absorbed directly into the bloodstream\n    - B: They are broken down by stomach acid and absorbed through the intestinal wall\n    - C: They are transported by proteins that attach to the vitamins and act like couriers after being broken down by bile\n    - D: They are not absorbed into the bloodstream\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What happens to excess water-soluble vitamins in the body?\n    - A: They are stored in the liver and fat cells\n    - B: They are passed out of the body via the kidneys\n    - C: They are converted into fat-soluble vitamins\n    - D: They are used to produce energy exclusively\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one of the primary roles of vitamin C in the human body?\n    - A: To make white blood cells and improve vision\n    - B: To fight infection and make collagen\n    - C: To gather calcium and phosphorus to make bones\n    - D: To work as an antioxidant exclusively in energy production\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding two more questions to cover other important concepts in the transcript:\n\n6) What is the primary difference between water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins in terms of their storage and excretion in the body?\n    - A: Water-soluble vitamins are stored in the liver and fat cells, while fat-soluble vitamins are excreted via the kidneys\n    - B: Water-soluble vitamins are excreted via the kidneys, while fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the liver and fat cells\n    - C: Water-soluble vitamins are converted into fat-soluble vitamins for storage and excretion\n    - D: Fat-soluble vitamins are converted into water-soluble vitamins for storage and excretion\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What can happen if the body has too much of any vitamin?\n    - A: The excess vitamins are stored in the liver and fat cells for later use\n    - B: The excess vitamins are excreted via the kidneys without any harm\n    - C: The excess vitamins can cause toxicity in the body\n    - D: The excess vitamins are converted into other essential nutrients\n[Correct answer]: C"
