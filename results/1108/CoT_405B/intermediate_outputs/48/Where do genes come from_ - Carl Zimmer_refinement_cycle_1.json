    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how many genes do humans have in their DNA?\n    - A: 10,000\n    - B: 20,000\n    - C: 30,000\n    - D: 40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) What molecule do plants have that helps them make food from sunlight?\n    - A: Keratin\n    - B: Collagen\n    - C: Dopamine\n    - D: Chlorophyll\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What can happen to genes when they are duplicated and mutated?\n    - A: They become inactive and are deleted from the genome\n    - B: They remain unchanged and continue to perform the same function\n    - C: They can take on new functions and contribute to the evolution of new traits\n    - D: They are only expressed in specific tissues or organs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and the distractors more plausible.\n\n4) What type of genes did early life forms have?\n    - A: Genes for complex structures and specialized functions\n    - B: Basic genes for fundamental biological processes and survival\n    - C: Genes for advanced cognitive abilities and intelligence\n    - D: Genes for specialized senses and perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and the distractors more plausible.\n\n5) This question was removed as it is not directly related to the transcript.\n\n6) This question was removed as it is not directly related to the transcript.\n\n7) What is the relationship between gene duplication and the emergence of new functions?\n    - A: Gene duplication leads to a loss of function and reduced fitness\n    - B: Gene duplication has no impact on function and does not contribute to evolution\n    - C: Gene duplication can lead to new functions and contribute to the evolution of new traits\n    - D: Gene duplication only occurs in response to environmental pressures and selection\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and the distractors more plausible.\n\n8) How do the genetic makeups of humans and apes compare?\n    - A: They are identical and have not changed since the common ancestor\n    - B: They are very similar, but with some key differences and variations\n    - C: They are very different, with few similarities and many distinct features\n    - D: They are not comparable due to the complexity of the genomes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What might happen to an organism's genes if it is exposed to a new environmental pressure?\n    - A: The genes will remain unchanged and not respond to the pressure\n    - B: The genes will mutate and become less functional, leading to reduced fitness\n    - C: The genes may duplicate and mutate, leading to new functions and adaptations\n    - D: The genes will be deleted from the genome, leading to a loss of function\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and the distractors more plausible.\n\n10) This question was removed as it is not directly related to the transcript.\n\n11) What is the significance of genetic mutations in the emergence of new traits and functions?\n    - A: They are insignificant and do not contribute to evolution\n    - B: They are somewhat significant, but only in certain cases and under specific conditions\n    - C: They are very significant and play a key role in the evolution of new traits and functions\n    - D: They are the only factor that contributes to the emergence of new traits and functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific and the distractors more plausible.\n\n12) This question was removed as it is not directly related to the transcript.\n\nNew questions were added to replace the removed ones:\n\n13) How do scientists think life started on Earth?\n    - A: Through the emergence of complex organisms and ecosystems\n    - B: Through the creation of basic genes and primitive microbes\n    - C: Through the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities and intelligence\n    - D: Through the development of specialized senses and perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What can happen to a gene that is duplicated and mutated over time?\n    - A: It will remain unchanged and continue to perform the same function\n    - B: It will become inactive and be deleted from the genome\n    - C: It can take on new functions and contribute to the evolution of new traits\n    - D: It will only be expressed in specific tissues or organs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is an example of a gene that has evolved to take on a new function?\n    - A: A gene for chlorophyll in plants\n    - B: A gene for keratin in humans\n    - C: A gene for venom in snakes\n    - D: A gene for dopamine in humans\n[Correct answer]: C"
