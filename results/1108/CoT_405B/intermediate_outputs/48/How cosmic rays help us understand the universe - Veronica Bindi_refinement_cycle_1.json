    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) How far can the Hubble Telescope see objects in space?\n    - A: 1,000,000,000 light years away\n    - B: 5,000,000,000 light years away\n    - C: 13,000,000,000 light years away\n    - D: 20,000,000,000 light years away\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Who first discovered cosmic rays in 1912?\n    - A: Albert Einstein\n    - B: Victor Hess\n    - C: Galileo Galilei\n    - D: Isaac Newton\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What can cosmic rays provide from distant parts of the cosmos?\n    - A: Physical data and visible light\n    - B: Physical data and radio waves\n    - C: Physical data\n    - D: Only visible light\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What did Victor Hess discover increases at greater altitudes and does not come from the Earth's atmosphere or the sun?\n    - A: Radiation from the Earth's core\n    - B: Radiation from the sun\n    - C: Radiation from cosmic rays\n    - D: Atmospheric pressure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can the study of cosmic rays help scientists mitigate the effects of?\n    - A: Cosmic radiation on space travel\n    - B: Solar radiation on space travel\n    - C: Atmospheric radiation on space travel\n    - D: Gravity on space travel\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) What can the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer provide information about that can be useful for space travel?\n    - A: Antimatter, dark matter, and cosmic radiation\n    - B: Antimatter, dark matter, and solar radiation\n    - C: Cosmic radiation, solar radiation, and gravity\n    - D: Antimatter, dark matter, and gravity\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do magnetic shockwaves generated by violent disturbances in space affect cosmic rays?\n    - A: They slow down cosmic rays\n    - B: They accelerate cosmic rays\n    - C: They have no effect on cosmic rays\n    - D: They create cosmic rays\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What can the study of the frequency of different particles in cosmic rays provide insights into?\n    - A: The relative abundance of elements in the Earth's atmosphere\n    - B: The relative abundance of elements in the universe\n    - C: The relative abundance of elements in the sun\n    - D: The relative abundance of elements in black holes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be gained by combining the data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer with other observations of the universe?\n    - A: A complete understanding of the Earth's atmosphere\n    - B: A complete understanding of the sun's structure\n    - C: A more complete understanding of the universe's composition and structure\n    - D: A complete understanding of black holes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be developed by using the insights gained from the study of cosmic rays?\n    - A: New theories about the Earth's atmosphere\n    - B: New theories about the sun's structure\n    - C: New theories about the universe and its evolution\n    - D: New theories about black holes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the significance of the discovery of cosmic rays?\n    - A: It provided new insights into the Earth's atmosphere\n    - B: It provided new insights into the sun's structure\n    - C: It provided new insights into the universe and its composition\n    - D: It provided no new insights\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is continued research into cosmic rays important?\n    - A: It can help us understand the Earth's atmosphere\n    - B: It can help us understand the sun's structure\n    - C: It can help us understand the universe and its evolution\n    - D: It is not important\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo major changes were made to the questions, but some minor adjustments were made to improve clarity and concision. The distractors remain plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
