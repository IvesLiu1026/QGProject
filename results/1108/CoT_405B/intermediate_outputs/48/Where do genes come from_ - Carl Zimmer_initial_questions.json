    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge**\n\n1) Approximately how many genes do humans have in their DNA?\n    - A: 10,000\n    - B: 20,000\n    - C: 30,000\n    - D: 40,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What molecule do plants have that helps them make food from sunlight?\n    - A: Keratin\n    - B: Collagen\n    - C: Dopamine\n    - D: Chlorophyll\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1) What happens to genes when they are duplicated and mutated?\n    - A: They become inactive\n    - B: They are deleted from the genome\n    - C: They can take on new functions\n    - D: They remain unchanged\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What type of genes did early life forms have?\n    - A: Complex genes for specialized functions\n    - B: Basic genes for survival\n    - C: Genes for advanced cognitive abilities\n    - D: Genes for specialized senses\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application**\n\n1) A genetic mutation has been linked to a new disease. What is a potential consequence of this mutation?\n    - A: The disease will be more easily treatable\n    - B: The disease will be more resistant to treatment\n    - C: The disease will have no impact on the population\n    - D: The disease will only affect a small subset of the population\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why is genetic diversity important in populations?\n    - A: It increases the risk of genetic disorders\n    - B: It decreases the fitness of individuals\n    - C: It allows populations to adapt to changing environments\n    - D: It has no impact on the population\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between gene duplication and the emergence of new functions?\n    - A: Gene duplication leads to a loss of function\n    - B: Gene duplication has no impact on function\n    - C: Gene duplication can lead to new functions\n    - D: Gene duplication only occurs in response to environmental pressures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How do the genetic makeups of humans and apes compare?\n    - A: They are identical\n    - B: They are very similar, but with some key differences\n    - C: They are very different, with few similarities\n    - D: They are not comparable\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What might happen to an organism's genes if it is exposed to a new environmental pressure?\n    - A: The genes will remain unchanged\n    - B: The genes will mutate and become less functional\n    - C: The genes may duplicate and mutate, leading to new functions\n    - D: The genes will be deleted from the genome\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How might genetic information be used to develop new treatments for diseases?\n    - A: By ignoring genetic information and focusing on symptoms\n    - B: By using genetic information to understand disease mechanisms and develop targeted treatments\n    - C: By using genetic information to develop treatments that are not tailored to individual needs\n    - D: By not using genetic information at all\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1) What is the significance of genetic mutations in the emergence of new traits and functions?\n    - A: They are insignificant and have no impact\n    - B: They are somewhat significant, but only in certain cases\n    - C: They are very significant and play a key role\n    - D: They are the only factor that contributes to the emergence of new traits and functions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the potential risk of genetic engineering and gene editing technologies?\n    - A: There is no risk\n    - B: There is a small risk, but it is outweighed by the benefits\n    - C: There is a significant risk that must be carefully considered\n    - D: The risk is too great, and these technologies should not be used\n[Correct answer]: C"
