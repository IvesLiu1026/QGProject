    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, enhance clarity and conciseness, confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect, and ensure correct answers are accurate. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who is considered the \"father of parapsychology\" and conducted experiments on telekinesis in the 1930s?\n    - A: Sigmund Freud\n    - B: Joseph Banks Rhine\n    - C: Carl Jung\n    - D: Charles Darwin\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What discipline studies psychic phenomena, including telekinesis?\n    - A: Psychology\n    - B: Parapsychology\n    - C: Physics\n    - D: Biology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why do scientists disagree with parapsychologists regarding the field of parapsychology?\n    - A: Parapsychologists do not use empirical evidence.\n    - B: Parapsychologists regard their field as a science, but other scientists disagree.\n    - C: Parapsychologists have not conducted enough experiments.\n    - D: Parapsychologists have not published their findings.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the main reason why the idea of telekinesis is not supported by science?\n    - A: There is a lack of funding for research.\n    - B: The idea of telekinesis contradicts established scientific laws and lacks strong evidence.\n    - C: Scientists are not interested in studying telekinesis.\n    - D: The concept of telekinesis is too complex to study.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How have researchers used brain signals to help stroke patients?\n    - A: By controlling their heart rate\n    - B: By controlling a robotic arm to move objects\n    - C: By controlling their breathing\n    - D: By controlling their blood pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Why do organizations offer prize money for anyone who can prove that psychic abilities, including telekinesis, are real?\n    - A: To promote the field of parapsychology\n    - B: To encourage people to develop their psychic abilities\n    - C: To provide evidence for the existence of psychic abilities\n    - D: To challenge claims of psychic abilities and promote a scientific approach\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between brain waves and physical objects in the context of telekinesis?\n    - A: Brain waves can control physical objects directly.\n    - B: Brain waves can control physical objects indirectly.\n    - C: Brain waves are not strong or far-reaching enough to influence physical objects.\n    - D: Brain waves have no effect on physical objects.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a key challenge in studying telekinesis?\n    - A: The lack of anecdotal claims\n    - B: The difficulty in applying the scientific method\n    - C: The lack of consensus on what is being measured\n    - D: The limited availability of research funding\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the result of evaluating telekinetic claims through a scientific lens?\n    - A: Telekinesis is supported by empirical evidence.\n    - B: Telekinesis is not supported by empirical evidence.\n    - C: Telekinesis is a scientifically proven concept.\n    - D: Telekinesis is a matter of personal conviction.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the justification for considering telekinesis as a matter of personal conviction rather than a scientific fact?\n    - A: The lack of scientific evidence supporting telekinesis.\n    - B: The existence of anecdotal claims supporting telekinesis.\n    - C: The limitations of science in studying psychic phenomena.\n    - D: The need for a more rigorous approach to studying psychic phenomena.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) How do researchers explain the ability of stroke patients to control a robotic arm using their thoughts?\n    - A: Through the power of telekinesis\n    - B: Through the use of measurable brain signals and wires\n    - C: Through the application of magnetic forces\n    - D: Through the use of gravitational forces\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the relationship between telekinesis and the laws of physics?\n    - A: Telekinesis is supported by the laws of physics.\n    - B: Telekinesis contradicts the laws of physics.\n    - C: Telekinesis is not related to the laws of physics.\n    - D: Telekinesis is an exception to the laws of physics.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions that were redundant or unclear and rephrased some questions to improve clarity and concision. I also ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect and that the correct answers are accurate."
