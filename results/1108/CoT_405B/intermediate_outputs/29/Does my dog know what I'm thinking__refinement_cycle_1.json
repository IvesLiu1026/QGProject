Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is unique about Chaser, a border collie, compared to other animals?\n    - A: Chaser can only understand nouns.\n    - B: Chaser has a vocabulary of over 1,000 words, similar to a 4-year-old child.\n    - C: Chaser can only process verbal meaning in her right hemisphere.\n    - D: Chaser is the only dog that seeks out eye contact with humans.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which part of the brain do dogs use to process verbal meaning?\n    - A: Right hemisphere\n    - B: Left hemisphere\n    - C: Both hemispheres equally\n    - D: Neither hemisphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What does the Clever Hans phenomenon demonstrate about language and communication?\n    - A: Language is only about sound frequencies.\n    - B: Language is only about non-verbal cues.\n    - C: Language involves both sound frequencies and non-verbal cues.\n    - D: Language is irrelevant to animal behavior.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) According to Darwin's theory, what is universal and innate across species?\n    - A: Language and verbal communication\n    - B: Emotional expression and interpretation\n    - C: Problem-solving abilities\n    - D: Memory and learning\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can understanding how dogs process language and emotions improve human-dog relationships?\n    - A: By ignoring non-verbal cues\n    - B: By only using verbal commands\n    - C: By recognizing the importance of both verbal and non-verbal communication\n    - D: By reducing interaction with dogs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can recognizing the Clever Hans phenomenon help humans avoid in animal behavior?\n    - A: Misinterpreting animal behavior\n    - B: Understanding animal behavior\n    - C: Ignoring animal behavior\n    - D: Overreacting to animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What does the study of dog cognition and behavior reveal about humans and dogs?\n    - A: Only similarities between humans and dogs\n    - B: Only differences between humans and dogs\n    - C: Both similarities and differences between humans and dogs\n    - D: Neither similarities nor differences between humans and dogs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What does the left-gaze bias in dogs suggest about human-dog communication and interaction?\n    - A: Dogs are not interested in human emotions and intentions\n    - B: Dogs are only interested in human verbal communication\n    - C: Dogs genuinely want to understand human emotions and intentions\n    - D: Dogs are indifferent to human emotions and intentions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can combining the understanding of dog language and emotions with the concept of Clever Hans provide?\n    - A: New insights into human-dog communication\n    - B: Confusion about human-dog relationships\n    - C: A complete understanding of dog behavior\n    - D: A dismissal of the importance of non-verbal cues\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) What can integrating Darwin's theory with modern research on dog cognition shed light on?\n    - A: The evolution of human-dog relationships\n    - B: The irrelevance of emotional expression and interpretation\n    - C: The superiority of human intelligence\n    - D: The limitations of dog cognition\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is necessary to advance our understanding of human-dog relationships?\n    - A: Ignoring research findings\n    - B: Critically evaluating the methods and conclusions of studies on dog behavior and cognition\n    - C: Only considering verbal communication\n    - D: Disregarding the importance of non-verbal cues\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is essential for evaluating the implications of the Clever Hans phenomenon?\n    - A: Dismissing the importance of non-verbal cues\n    - B: Considering only verbal communication\n    - C: Evaluating the implications for human-dog communication and relationships\n    - D: Ignoring the phenomenon altogether\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to improve clarity and conciseness, but the questions generally aligned with the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
