The Faberg√© Egg Museum is a 100-story building with a single egg displayed on each floor.\n2. The eggs are identical in weight and construction but vary in rarity and value.\n3. The thief has two souvenir eggs to test drop and find the highest floor at which an egg will survive the fall.\n4. The experiment can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The thief's goal is to find the most expensive egg that can survive a drop from the highest floor possible.\n2. The thief uses a strategy of dropping the first egg from different floors at larger intervals to narrow down the range where the critical floor can be found.\n3. Once the first egg breaks, the thief uses the second egg to explore the interval floor by floor.\n4. The thief is trying to divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number of throws to find it.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. The strategy of dividing the building into sections can be applied to other problems where a range needs to be narrowed down.\n2. The concept of using intervals to find a specific point can be applied to real-world scenarios such as finding the optimal price for a product or the optimal dosage for a medication.\n3. The idea of using a limited number of trials to find a solution can be applied to situations where resources are limited.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The relationship between the number of intervals and the number of throws required to find the correct floor.\n2. The contrast between using large intervals and small intervals to find the correct floor.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the size of the intervals and the number of throws required to find the correct floor.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. Combining the idea of using intervals with the concept of limited trials to find a solution.\n2. Using the strategy of dividing the building into sections to find the correct floor and applying it to other problems.\n3. Integrating the concept of using replica eggs to test drop with the strategy of dividing the building into sections.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of the thief's strategy in finding the correct floor.\n2. Justifying the use of a limited number of trials to find a solution.\n3. Critiquing the assumption that the eggs are identical in weight and construction but vary in rarity and value.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for creating assessment questions that target different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy."
