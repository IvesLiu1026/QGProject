    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level based on the content analysis provided:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the genetic code of the flu virus made of?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: RNA\n    - C: Protein\n    - D: Lipid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many subtypes of the influenza virus are there?\n    - A: Over 50\n    - B: Over 100\n    - C: Over 200\n    - D: Over 500\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) Why is the flu virus a tough target for vaccines?\n    - A: Because it has a slow mutation rate\n    - B: Because it has a single subtype\n    - C: Because it has numerous subtypes and rapid genetic mutations\n    - D: Because it is a DNA virus\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the primary way the flu vaccine works?\n    - A: By introducing live, attenuated viruses into the body\n    - B: By introducing antigens that trigger the production of antibodies\n    - C: By boosting the immune system with vitamins and minerals\n    - D: By killing infected cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) What can understanding how the flu virus mutates and spreads inform?\n    - A: Public health strategies for preventing outbreaks\n    - B: Personal decisions about getting vaccinated\n    - C: Development of a universal flu vaccine\n    - D: Understanding of the flu vaccine's mechanism\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What can recognizing the importance of herd immunity encourage individuals to do?\n    - A: Get vaccinated to protect only themselves\n    - B: Get vaccinated to protect vulnerable members of their community\n    - C: Avoid getting vaccinated to avoid side effects\n    - D: Wait until they are infected to get vaccinated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the flu virus's genetic code and its ability to mutate rapidly?\n    - A: The genetic code is made of DNA, which slows down mutation\n    - B: The genetic code is made of RNA, which speeds up mutation\n    - C: The genetic code has no effect on mutation rate\n    - D: The genetic code is made of protein, which stabilizes mutation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the contrast between the flu virus and other viruses, such as mumps and rubella, in terms of vaccine effectiveness?\n    - A: The flu virus has a more effective vaccine than mumps and rubella\n    - B: The flu virus has a less effective vaccine than mumps and rubella\n    - C: The flu virus and mumps and rubella have equally effective vaccines\n    - D: The flu virus has no vaccine, while mumps and rubella do\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can combining knowledge of the flu virus's genetic code and its ability to mutate with the concept of herd immunity inform vaccination strategies?\n    - A: By developing vaccines that target specific subtypes\n    - B: By developing vaccines that provide lifetime protection\n    - C: By promoting vaccination to protect vulnerable members of the community\n    - D: By combining all of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What can integrating understanding of the flu vaccine's mechanism with the idea of a universal flu vaccine inform?\n    - A: Future research and development of the flu vaccine\n    - B: Current vaccination strategies\n    - C: Public health campaigns\n    - D: Personal decisions about getting vaccinated\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is a potential critique of the use of live, attenuated vaccines in certain populations?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They are too effective\n    - C: They may cause infection in individuals with impaired immune systems\n    - D: They are not widely available\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is a potential justification for investing in the development of a universal flu vaccine?\n    - A: It would be too expensive to develop\n    - B: It would not provide significant benefits over current vaccines\n    - C: It would provide lifetime protection against all subtypes of the flu virus\n    - D: It would only protect against a single subtype of the flu virus\n[Correct answer]: C"
