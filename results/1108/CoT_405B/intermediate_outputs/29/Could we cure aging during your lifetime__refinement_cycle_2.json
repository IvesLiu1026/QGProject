    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What term refers to the part of our lives during which we are disease-free?\n    - A: Lifespan\n    - B: Healthspan\n    - C: Telomere\n    - D: Senescence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary function of telomeres in human cells?\n    - A: To produce energy\n    - B: To protect cells from damage by acting as a buffer for DNA\n    - C: To regulate cell growth\n    - D: To repair DNA\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the current focus of the medical community in terms of aging?\n    - A: Optimizing lifespans\n    - B: Optimizing healthspans\n    - C: Understanding the causes of aging\n    - D: Developing treatments for age-related diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential benefit of eliminating senescent cells?\n    - A: Improved health and increased lifespan\n    - B: Decreased inflammation\n    - C: Increased telomere length\n    - D: Reduced stem cell function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How can the concept of healthspan extension be applied to human health?\n    - A: By increasing lifespan\n    - B: By living a longer, healthier life through a combination of therapies\n    - C: By reducing the risk of age-related diseases\n    - D: By improving athletic performance\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential application of NAD+ and other substances to boost cellular health?\n    - A: Treating age-related diseases\n    - B: Increasing lifespan\n    - C: Improving cognitive function\n    - D: Enhancing cellular metabolism and reducing DNA damage\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What happens to telomeres during cell division?\n    - A: They lengthen\n    - B: They shrink\n    - C: They remain unchanged\n    - D: They are unrelated to cell division\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the effect of senescent cells on surrounding tissue?\n    - A: They improve tissue health\n    - B: They harm tissue and are linked to many diseases\n    - C: They have no effect on tissue\n    - D: They rejuvenate older cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential comprehensive approach to healthspan extension?\n    - A: Focusing solely on senescent cells\n    - B: Combining senescent cell therapy, NAD+, and stem cells\n    - C: Increasing telomere length\n    - D: Reducing inflammation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a potential outcome of integrating discoveries from senescent cells, NAD+, and stem cells?\n    - A: Development of new treatments for age-related diseases\n    - B: Increased lifespan\n    - C: Improved athletic performance\n    - D: Enhanced cognitive function\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of senescent cell therapy in humans?\n    - A: Results from mouse studies are directly applicable to humans\n    - B: Results from mouse studies should be considered, but human trials are necessary\n    - C: Senescent cell therapy is too expensive\n    - D: Senescent cell therapy is too time-consuming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential consideration when using NAD+ as an anti-aging treatment?\n    - A: It is a proven cure for aging\n    - B: It has limitations, potential side effects, and requires further research\n    - C: It is too expensive\n    - D: It is too time-consuming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
