    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is unique about Chaser, a border collie, compared to other animals?\n    - A: Chaser can only understand nouns.\n    - B: Chaser has a vocabulary of over 1,000 words, similar to a 4-year-old child.\n    - C: Chaser can only process verbal meaning in her right hemisphere.\n    - D: Chaser is the only dog that seeks out eye contact with humans.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which part of the brain do dogs use to process verbal meaning?\n    - A: Right hemisphere\n    - B: Left hemisphere\n    - C: Both hemispheres equally\n    - D: Neither hemisphere\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What does the Clever Hans phenomenon demonstrate about language and communication?\n    - A: Language is only about sound frequencies.\n    - B: Language is only about non-verbal cues.\n    - C: Language involves both sound frequencies and non-verbal cues.\n    - D: Language is irrelevant to animal behavior.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) According to Darwin's theory, what is universal and innate across species?\n    - A: Language and verbal communication\n    - B: Emotional expression and interpretation\n    - C: Problem-solving abilities\n    - D: Memory and learning\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can be inferred about human-dog relationships based on the study of dog cognition and behavior?\n    - A: Humans and dogs only share similarities in language processing.\n    - B: Humans and dogs only share differences in emotional expression.\n    - C: Humans and dogs share both similarities and differences in language processing and emotional expression.\n    - D: Humans and dogs do not share any similarities or differences in language processing and emotional expression.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can recognizing the Clever Hans phenomenon help humans avoid in animal behavior?\n    - A: Misinterpreting animal behavior due to subtle cues.\n    - B: Understanding animal behavior through verbal commands.\n    - C: Ignoring animal behavior altogether.\n    - D: Overreacting to animal behavior.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What does the left-gaze bias in dogs suggest about human-dog communication and interaction?\n    - A: Dogs are not interested in human emotions and intentions.\n    - B: Dogs are only interested in human verbal communication.\n    - C: Dogs genuinely want to understand human emotions and intentions.\n    - D: Dogs are indifferent to human emotions and intentions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What can be concluded about the evolution of human-dog relationships based on Darwin's theory and modern research?\n    - A: Human-dog relationships have not evolved over time.\n    - B: Human-dog relationships are solely based on verbal communication.\n    - C: Human-dog relationships have evolved to involve both verbal and non-verbal communication.\n    - D: Human-dog relationships are irrelevant to emotional expression and interpretation.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is necessary to advance our understanding of human-dog relationships?\n    - A: Ignoring research findings on dog behavior and cognition.\n    - B: Critically evaluating the methods and conclusions of studies on dog behavior and cognition.\n    - C: Only considering verbal communication in human-dog interactions.\n    - D: Disregarding the importance of non-verbal cues in human-dog interactions.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is essential for evaluating the implications of the Clever Hans phenomenon?\n    - A: Dismissing the importance of non-verbal cues in human-dog interactions.\n    - B: Considering only verbal communication in human-dog interactions.\n    - C: Evaluating the implications for human-dog communication and relationships.\n    - D: Ignoring the phenomenon altogether.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI removed questions 11 and 12 as they were similar to questions 9 and 10. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
