    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What triggers a change in appearance and behavior in desert locusts?\n    - A: When they encounter a predator\n    - B: When they come into contact with each other's hind legs\n    - C: When they find a new food source\n    - D: When they experience a change in temperature\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How do members of a swarm typically interact with each other?\n    - A: They follow a single leader\n    - B: They interact with all members of the swarm\n    - C: They interact only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues\n    - D: They do not interact with each other at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is one benefit of swarming for small prey?\n    - A: It increases their speed\n    - B: It allows them to change color\n    - C: It makes them appear larger and reduces the chance of capture\n    - D: It helps them find food more efficiently\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What arises when hundreds or millions of organisms follow the same simple rules?\n    - A: Individual intelligence\n    - B: Swarm intelligence\n    - C: Collective confusion\n    - D: Group chaos\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is one potential application of swarm behavior in technology?\n    - A: Designing drones that can navigate confined spaces without colliding\n    - B: Developing software for more efficient email management\n    - C: Creating robots that can play musical instruments\n    - D: Building machines that can translate languages\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can insect-inspired robot teams be used?\n    - A: To assist in search and rescue missions\n    - B: To provide customer service\n    - C: To manage financial transactions\n    - D: To predict weather patterns\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What can trigger the formation of a swarm in desert locusts?\n    - A: Abundant food\n    - B: Scarce food\n    - C: Changes in temperature\n    - D: Presence of predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What are some potential consequences of swarming behavior?\n    - A: Only benefits, such as increased foraging efficiency\n    - B: Only drawbacks, such as increased disease transmission\n    - C: Both benefits and drawbacks, such as increased foraging efficiency and increased disease transmission\n    - D: Neither benefits nor drawbacks\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What can be combined to lead to innovative solutions?\n    - A: Swarm behavior and individualism\n    - B: Technology and swarm behavior\n    - C: Human behavior and animal behavior\n    - D: Collective action and individual action\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can provide insights into how to design more effective communication systems in human societies?\n    - A: Analyzing the role of pheromones in army ant behavior\n    - B: Studying the behavior of individual animals\n    - C: Examining the benefits and drawbacks of swarming\n    - D: Investigating the differences between human and animal behavior\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What should be evaluated when considering the use of swarm-inspired technologies?\n    - A: Their potential to improve email management\n    - B: Their effectiveness in real-world applications\n    - C: Their ability to predict weather patterns\n    - D: Their potential to improve customer service\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What should be assessed when considering the potential risks and benefits of collective action in human populations?\n    - A: The potential for destructive mobs\n    - B: The potential for peaceful global revolutions\n    - C: Both A and B\n    - D: Neither A nor B\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined question 13 (previously not included):\n13) What is a potential risk of swarming behavior in army ants?\n    - A: They may become too slow\n    - B: They may get caught in a loop following pheromone trails\n    - C: They may lose their sense of direction\n    - D: They may become too aggressive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for the other questions."
