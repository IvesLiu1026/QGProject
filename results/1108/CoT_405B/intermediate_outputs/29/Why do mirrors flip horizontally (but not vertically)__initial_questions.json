    "initial_questions": "**Knowledge Level:**\n\n1) What happens to text when it is reflected in a mirror?\n    - A: The text appears in the same order and upside down.\n    - B: The text appears in reverse order and upside down.\n    - C: The text appears in the same order and right-side up.\n    - D: The text appears in reverse order but remains right-side up.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What direction does a mirror flip an image in?\n    - A: The x direction\n    - B: The y direction\n    - C: The z direction\n    - D: Both the x and y directions\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension Level:**\n\n1) Why do we perceive mirror reflections in a certain way?\n    - A: Because the mirror is actively flipping the image\n    - B: Because of the way we interact with objects and our daily experiences\n    - C: Because of the concept of symmetry alone\n    - D: Because the mirror is only reflecting what is presented to it in the y direction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What concept affects our perception of mirror reflections?\n    - A: Only the concept of x, y, and z directions\n    - B: Only the concept of symmetry\n    - C: Both the concept of x, y, and z directions and symmetry\n    - D: Neither the concept of x, y, and z directions nor symmetry\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Application Level:**\n\n1) You are trying to read text on a t-shirt in a mirror. How will the text appear?\n    - A: In the same order and upside down\n    - B: In reverse order and upside down\n    - C: In the same order and right-side up\n    - D: In reverse order but remains right-side up\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) You are trying to understand how a mirror reflects an image of a symmetrical object. What concept should you consider?\n    - A: The concept of x and y directions\n    - B: The concept of z-direction flipping\n    - C: The concept of symmetry alone\n    - D: The concept of x, y, and z directions and symmetry\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Analysis Level:**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the way an object is presented to a mirror and how it appears in the reflection?\n    - A: The object appears exactly as it is presented\n    - B: The object appears as a vertical flip of how it is presented\n    - C: The object appears as a horizontal flip of how it is presented\n    - D: The object appears as a reflection of how it is presented, taking into account the x, y, and z directions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the way we interact with objects and our perception of mirror reflections?\n    - A: Our daily experiences have no effect on our perception of mirror reflections\n    - B: Our daily experiences influence our perception of mirror reflections, but only in the x direction\n    - C: Our daily experiences influence our perception of mirror reflections, but only in the y direction\n    - D: Our daily experiences influence our perception of mirror reflections, taking into account the x, y, and z directions\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Synthesis Level:**\n\n1) How can you combine the concepts of x, y, and z directions with the idea of symmetry to understand how mirrors reflect images?\n    - A: By considering only the x direction and symmetry\n    - B: By considering only the y direction and symmetry\n    - C: By considering only the z direction and symmetry\n    - D: By considering the x, y, and z directions and how they interact with symmetry\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How can you integrate the idea of daily experiences and interactions with objects to understand how our perception of mirror reflections is influenced?\n    - A: By considering only the role of symmetry\n    - B: By considering only the role of the x, y, and z directions\n    - C: By considering the interaction between our daily experiences and the x, y, and z directions\n    - D: By considering the interaction between our daily experiences, the x, y, and z directions, and symmetry\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n**Evaluation Level:**\n\n1) Is the explanation for why mirrors appear to flip things horizontally valid?\n    - A: Yes, because it takes into account the x, y, and z directions\n    - B: Yes, because it takes into account only the x direction\n    - C: No, because it does not take into account the role of symmetry\n    - D: No, because it is based on incorrect assumptions about the x, y, and z directions\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Is the idea that the mirror is simply reflecting what is presented to it, rather than actively flipping the image, justified?\n    - A: Yes, because it is supported by the concept of x, y, and z directions\n    - B: Yes, because it is supported by the concept of symmetry alone\n    - C: No, because it does not take into account the role of daily experiences\n    - D: No, because it is based on incorrect assumptions about the nature of mirror reflections\n[Correct answer]: A"
