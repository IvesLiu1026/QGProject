    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of genetic material does the flu virus contain?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: RNA\n    - C: Protein\n    - D: Lipid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many subtypes of the influenza virus exist?\n    - A: Over 50\n    - B: Over 100\n    - C: Over 200\n    - D: Over 500\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is the flu virus a challenging target for vaccine development?\n    - A: Because it has a slow mutation rate and a single subtype\n    - B: Because it has a single subtype and is a DNA virus\n    - C: Because it has numerous subtypes and rapid genetic mutations\n    - D: Because it is a DNA virus with a slow mutation rate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does the flu vaccine primarily work?\n    - A: By introducing live, attenuated viruses into the body\n    - B: By introducing antigens that trigger the production of antibodies\n    - C: By boosting the immune system with vitamins and minerals\n    - D: By killing infected cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding the flu virus's mutation and spread inform?\n    - A: Public health strategies for preventing outbreaks\n    - B: Personal decisions about getting vaccinated\n    - C: Development of a universal flu vaccine\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What can recognizing the importance of herd immunity encourage individuals to do?\n    - A: Get vaccinated to protect only themselves\n    - B: Get vaccinated to protect vulnerable members of their community\n    - C: Avoid getting vaccinated to avoid side effects\n    - D: Wait until they are infected to get vaccinated\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the flu virus's genetic code contribute to its rapid mutation rate?\n    - A: The genetic code is made of DNA, which slows down mutation\n    - B: The genetic code is made of RNA, which speeds up mutation\n    - C: The genetic code has no effect on mutation rate\n    - D: The genetic code is made of protein, which stabilizes mutation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the effectiveness of the flu vaccine compare to vaccines for diseases like mumps and rubella?\n    - A: The flu vaccine is more effective\n    - B: The flu vaccine is less effective\n    - C: The flu vaccine and mumps and rubella vaccines are equally effective\n    - D: The flu vaccine has no effect, while mumps and rubella vaccines do\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can combining knowledge of the flu virus's genetic code, mutation rate, and herd immunity inform vaccination strategies?\n    - A: By developing vaccines that target specific subtypes\n    - B: By developing vaccines that provide lifetime protection\n    - C: By promoting vaccination to protect vulnerable members of the community\n    - D: By combining all of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What can integrating understanding of the flu vaccine's mechanism with the idea of a universal flu vaccine inform?\n    - A: Future research and development of the flu vaccine\n    - B: Current vaccination strategies\n    - C: Public health campaigns\n    - D: Personal decisions about getting vaccinated\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential concern with using live, attenuated vaccines in certain populations?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They are too effective\n    - C: They may cause infection in individuals with impaired immune systems\n    - D: They are not widely available\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a potential justification for investing in the development of a universal flu vaccine?\n    - A: It would be too expensive to develop\n    - B: It would not provide significant benefits over current vaccines\n    - C: It would provide lifetime protection against all subtypes of the flu virus\n    - D: It would only protect against a single subtype of the flu virus\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-12."
