    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the body's mass is comprised of the brain?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 2%\n    - C: 10%\n    - D: 15%\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What type of stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a vessel and interrupts blood flow to the brain?\n    - A: Hemorrhagic\n    - B: Ischemic\n    - C: Vascular\n    - D: Cerebral\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the effect of oxygen deprivation on brain cells during a stroke?\n    - A: They become dormant\n    - B: They regenerate\n    - C: They die, potentially leading to permanent damage\n    - D: They adapt to the lack of oxygen\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why is prompt medical care crucial in treating strokes?\n    - A: To prevent infection\n    - B: To reduce pain\n    - C: To prevent permanent damage and improve outcomes\n    - D: To reduce hospital stay\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What should you do if you suspect someone is experiencing a stroke?\n    - A: Call their doctor for an appointment\n    - B: Try to drive them to the hospital\n    - C: Call emergency services immediately\n    - D: Give them medication\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) (Removed as the transcript does not provide information on how to prevent strokes.)\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brain's oxygen supply and the occurrence of strokes?\n    - A: The brain's oxygen supply has no impact on stroke occurrence\n    - B: The brain's oxygen supply is directly related to stroke occurrence\n    - C: The brain's oxygen supply is only related to hemorrhagic strokes\n    - D: The brain's oxygen supply is only related to ischemic strokes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the primary difference between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes?\n    - A: Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by clots, while ischemic strokes are caused by vessel damage\n    - B: Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by vessel damage, while ischemic strokes are caused by clots\n    - C: Hemorrhagic strokes are more common than ischemic strokes\n    - D: Ischemic strokes are more common than hemorrhagic strokes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) (Removed as it is not directly related to the provided transcript.)\n\n10) What can be achieved by combining knowledge of stroke causes, symptoms, and treatment options?\n    - A: Improved outcomes for stroke patients\n    - B: Reduced risk of stroke\n    - C: Increased awareness of stroke symptoms\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of the FAST test?\n    - A: It is not widely known or used\n    - B: It is not effective in identifying strokes\n    - C: It may not detect all types of strokes\n    - D: It is too complex for non-medical professionals to use\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is prompt medical care important in preventing permanent damage and improving outcomes for stroke patients?\n    - A: Because it allows for prompt treatment with TPA or endovascular thrombectomy\n    - B: Because it reduces the risk of infection\n    - C: Because it improves patient comfort\n    - D: Because it reduces hospital stay\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n13) What is the name of the medication that can break up blood clots and restore blood flow to the brain?\n    - A: Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA)\n    - B: Aspirin\n    - C: Warfarin\n    - D: Heparin\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n14) What is the purpose of an endovascular thrombectomy in treating strokes?\n    - A: To remove a blood clot from a blocked vessel\n    - B: To repair damaged blood vessels\n    - C: To improve blood flow to the brain\n    - D: To reduce swelling in the brain\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n15) What does the \"T\" stand for in the FAST test?\n    - A: Time\n    - B: Treatment\n    - C: Test\n    - D: Therapy\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
