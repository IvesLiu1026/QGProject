    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions as follows:\n\n1) What unique feature does the Faberg√© Egg Museum have?\n    - A: Multiple eggs displayed on each floor.\n    - B: A single egg displayed on each of its 100 floors.\n    - C: Eggs of varying weights and constructions.\n    - D: Only two souvenir eggs on display.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What constraint does the thief face when experimenting to find the highest floor at which an egg will survive the fall?\n    - A: The experiment can be repeated indefinitely.\n    - B: The experiment can only be repeated until one replica egg is smashed.\n    - C: The experiment can only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed.\n    - D: The experiment cannot be repeated at all.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the thief's primary goal in the experiment?\n    - A: To find the most expensive egg in the museum.\n    - B: To find the egg that can survive a drop from the lowest floor possible.\n    - C: To find the highest floor from which an egg can survive a drop.\n    - D: To find the egg that is identical in weight and construction to the others.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What strategy does the thief use to find the critical floor?\n    - A: Dropping the first egg from the same floor repeatedly.\n    - B: Dropping the first egg from different floors at larger intervals to narrow down the range.\n    - C: Dropping the second egg from the same floor repeatedly.\n    - D: Dropping both eggs from the same floor simultaneously.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a key characteristic of the strategy used by the thief?\n    - A: Unlimited resources.\n    - B: Limited number of trials.\n    - C: Identical weights and constructions.\n    - D: Multiple eggs.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the number of intervals affect the number of throws required to find the correct floor?\n    - A: As the number of intervals increases, the number of throws required decreases.\n    - B: As the number of intervals decreases, the number of throws required increases.\n    - C: The number of intervals has no effect on the number of throws required.\n    - D: The relationship between the number of intervals and the number of throws required is unpredictable.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the effect of using large intervals to find the correct floor?\n    - A: It increases the number of throws required.\n    - B: It decreases the number of throws required in the first egg drop but may require more throws with the second egg.\n    - C: It has no effect on the number of throws required.\n    - D: It makes the experiment more unpredictable.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the minimum number of tries required to guarantee finding the correct floor?\n    - A: 10 tries\n    - B: 14 tries\n    - C: 19 tries\n    - D: 100 tries\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be said about the effectiveness of the thief's strategy in finding the correct floor?\n    - A: It is ineffective because it requires unlimited resources.\n    - B: It is effective because it uses a limited number of trials to find a solution.\n    - C: It is ineffective because it only applies to finding the optimal price for a product.\n    - D: It is effective because it uses identical weights and constructions.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What justification can be made for using a limited number of trials to find a solution?\n    - A: It is justified because it requires unlimited resources.\n    - B: It is justified because it allows for a more precise solution.\n    - C: It is justified because it is more efficient and effective in certain situations.\n    - D: It is justified because it only applies to finding the optimal dosage for a medication.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a potential benefit of combining the idea of using intervals with the concept of limited trials?\n    - A: A strategy that requires unlimited resources.\n    - B: A strategy that is only applicable to finding the optimal price for a product.\n    - C: A strategy that can be applied to various problems where a range needs to be narrowed down.\n    - D: A strategy that is only effective for identifying the weight of an object.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can the strategy of dividing the building into sections be integrated with other concepts?\n    - A: By using it in isolation.\n    - B: By combining it with the concept of unlimited trials.\n    - C: By applying it to problems where a range needs to be narrowed down.\n    - D: By using it only for finding the optimal dosage for a medication.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI have removed questions that were redundant or not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript. I have also reworded some questions to enhance clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I have confirmed that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
