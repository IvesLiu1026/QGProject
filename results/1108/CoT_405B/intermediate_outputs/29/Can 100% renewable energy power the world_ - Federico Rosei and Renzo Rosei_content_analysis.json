    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge** (Specific facts or details that can be recalled directly):\n\n1. The world uses 35 billion barrels of oil every year.\n2. Scientists estimate that 40% of the world's oil has been consumed.\n3. At the current rate, oil and gas will run out in 50 years, and coal in about a century.\n4. Renewable energy sources (sun, water, wind) are abundant.\n5. Renewable energy currently provides about 13% of global energy needs.\n6. The sun radiates about 173 quadrillion watts of solar energy at the Earth.\n7. A surface spanning several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity at current usage levels.\n8. Solar plants must be located in areas with lots of sunshine year-round to maximize efficiency.\n9. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8% of the energy they carry due to resistance.\n10.
