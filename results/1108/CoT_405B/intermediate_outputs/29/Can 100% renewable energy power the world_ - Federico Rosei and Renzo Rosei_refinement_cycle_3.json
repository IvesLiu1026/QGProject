    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure alignment with key concepts, clarity, conciseness, plausible distractors, and accurate correct answers. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the estimated amount of oil consumed by the world every year?\n    - A: 20 billion barrels\n    - B: 35 billion barrels\n    - C: 50 billion barrels\n    - D: 60 billion barrels\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What percentage of global energy needs is currently provided by renewable energy?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 13%\n    - D: 20%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is the primary environmental concern associated with fossil fuel dependence mentioned in the transcript?\n    - A: Climate change\n    - B: Deforestation\n    - C: Water pollution\n    - D: Pollution of the Earth\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) Why is energy efficiency important in the transition to renewable energy?\n    - A: To reduce energy costs\n    - B: To increase energy production\n    - C: To minimize energy waste and reduce the strain on renewable energy sources\n    - D: To promote sustainable transportation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What factor should be considered when deciding on the location of solar panels?\n    - A: Proximity to the company's headquarters\n    - B: Availability of government incentives\n    - C: Amount of sunshine the location receives year-round\n    - D: Cost of installation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a potential solution to reduce energy loss during transportation?\n    - A: Using longer power lines\n    - B: Implementing energy-efficient technologies\n    - C: Developing new superconducting materials that operate at room temperature\n    - D: Increasing energy production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the energy density of lithium-ion batteries compare to gasoline?\n    - A: Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than gasoline\n    - B: Gasoline has a higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries\n    - C: Lithium-ion batteries and gasoline have the same energy density\n    - D: Energy density is not a relevant factor in comparing lithium-ion batteries and gasoline\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a promising solution to convert solar energy into a more easily transportable form?\n    - A: Developing more efficient solar panels\n    - B: Improving energy storage technologies\n    - C: Converting solar energy into chemical energy\n    - D: Increasing energy production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the potential benefit of combining scientific breakthroughs with economic and policy incentives in the transition to renewable energy?\n    - A: Reduced energy costs\n    - B: Increased energy production\n    - C: Accelerated transition to renewable energy\n    - D: Decreased energy efficiency\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential limitation of transitioning to 100% renewable energy?\n    - A: High upfront costs\n    - B: Intermittency of renewable energy sources\n    - C: Lack of government incentives\n    - D: Insufficient energy production\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How can the effectiveness of current policies and incentives in promoting renewable energy be assessed?\n    - A: By measuring the increase in renewable energy production\n    - B: By evaluating the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: By assessing the number of companies that have transitioned to renewable energy\n    - D: By all of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n12) What is the estimated timeframe for the world to run out of oil and gas at the current consumption rate?\n    - A: 20-30 years\n    - B: 50 years or so\n    - C: 100 years or more\n    - D: 200 years or more\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI removed questions that were not directly related to the transcript or were unclear. I also rephrased some questions to improve clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I ensured that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
