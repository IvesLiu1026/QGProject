    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how long is the human digestive tract when laid out in a straight line?\n    - A: 5 meters\n    - B: 10 meters\n    - C: 15 meters\n    - D: 20 meters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) At what age do most cases of colon cancer typically occur?\n    - A: 30 years or older\n    - B: 40 years or older\n    - C: 50 years or older\n    - D: 60 years or older\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What happens when cells in a polyp grow and divide rapidly?\n    - A: The polyp becomes benign\n    - B: The polyp remains the same size\n    - C: The polyp becomes cancerous\n    - D: The polyp disappears\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is suspected to contribute to the development of colon cancer?\n    - A: Environmental factors only\n    - B: Inherited genetic factors only\n    - C: A combination of environmental and inherited genetic factors\n    - D: Neither environmental nor inherited genetic factors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What should a person with a family history of colon cancer consult a doctor to determine the best age to initiate?\n    - A: Chemotherapy\n    - B: Surgery\n    - C: Screening\n    - D: Radiation therapy\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is a common purpose of a colonoscopy?\n    - A: To examine the colon for ulcers\n    - B: To examine the colon for inflammation\n    - C: To examine the colon for polyps\n    - D: To examine the colon for diverticulitis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between cell renewal in the colon's lining and the growth of polyps?\n    - A: Cell renewal prevents polyp growth\n    - B: Cell renewal has no effect on polyp growth\n    - C: Cell renewal can sometimes lead to polyp growth\n    - D: Cell renewal always leads to polyp growth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How do the activation of oncogenes and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes contribute to colon cancer development?\n    - A: They prevent colon cancer\n    - B: They have no effect on colon cancer development\n    - C: They contribute to colon cancer development\n    - D: They are the sole cause of colon cancer\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the combined effect of regular screenings and a healthy lifestyle on colon cancer prevention?\n    - A: They have no effect on colon cancer prevention\n    - B: They increase the risk of colon cancer\n    - C: They work together to prevent colon cancer\n    - D: They are mutually exclusive in preventing colon cancer\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can colonoscopy and other screening tests be used to reduce the risk of colon cancer?\n    - A: By using them to detect polyps only\n    - B: By using them to remove polyps only\n    - C: By using them to detect and remove polyps\n    - D: By not using them at all\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) Why is colonoscopy often recommended for colon cancer screening?\n    - A: It is a costly and invasive procedure\n    - B: It is the only test that can both find and remove polyps\n    - C: It is a routine procedure with no benefits\n    - D: It is only recommended for people with symptoms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the current understanding of the methods for detecting and treating colon cancer?\n    - A: They are perfect and do not require further research\n    - B: They are adequate, but further research is needed\n    - C: They are effective in detecting and removing polyps, but further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of the disease\n    - D: They are unnecessary, and colon cancer should not be treated\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to the questions to improve clarity and concision, while ensuring the distractors remain plausible but incorrect. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions effectively covered the key concepts in the transcript."
