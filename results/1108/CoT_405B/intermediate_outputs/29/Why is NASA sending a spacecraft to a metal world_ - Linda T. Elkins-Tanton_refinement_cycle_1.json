    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Approximately how far away from Earth is the asteroid 16 Psyche?\n    - A: 100 million kilometers\n    - B: 500 million kilometers\n    - C: 1 billion kilometers\n    - D: 2 billion kilometers\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the primary composition of the asteroid 16 Psyche?\n    - A: Nickel and iron\n    - B: Rock and gas\n    - C: Dust and ice\n    - D: Liquid and gas\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n3) What makes the surface of 16 Psyche unique compared to other asteroids?\n    - A: Its small size\n    - B: Its rocky composition\n    - C: Its heavy metal composition, primarily consisting of nickel and iron\n    - D: Its icy surface\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why is the mission to 16 Psyche an opportunity to study the Earth's core?\n    - A: Because 16 Psyche has a similar size to the Earth\n    - B: Because 16 Psyche has a similar atmosphere to the Earth\n    - C: Because 16 Psyche has an exposed metallic core, similar in composition to the Earth's core\n    - D: Because 16 Psyche is a planet\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What can the study of 16 Psyche provide insights into?\n    - A: The formation of stars\n    - B: The composition of the Earth's atmosphere\n    - C: The Earth's core and its composition\n    - D: The search for extraterrestrial life\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the primary goal of the instruments on board the spacecraft sent to 16 Psyche?\n    - A: To search for extraterrestrial life\n    - B: To study the Earth's atmosphere\n    - C: To analyze the composition of 16 Psyche and its magnetic field\n    - D: To develop new medical technologies\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What can the comparison between the Earth's core and 16 Psyche help scientists understand?\n    - A: The similarities and differences between the two\n    - B: The formation of stars\n    - C: The composition of the Earth's atmosphere\n    - D: The search for extraterrestrial life\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n8) What can the study of 16 Psyche's formation and composition inform our understanding of?\n    - A: The formation of planets and their cores\n    - B: The composition of the Earth's atmosphere\n    - C: The search for extraterrestrial life\n    - D: The development of new medical technologies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What can the combination of data from the 16 Psyche mission and our current understanding of the Earth's core lead to?\n    - A: New insights into planetary formation and composition\n    - B: A better understanding of the Earth's atmosphere\n    - C: The discovery of extraterrestrial life\n    - D: The development of new medical technologies\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n10) How can the study of 16 Psyche inform the development of new theories?\n    - A: About the formation of stars\n    - B: About the formation of planets and the composition of their cores\n    - C: About the search for extraterrestrial life\n    - D: About the development of new medical technologies\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How can the decision to send a mission to 16 Psyche be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on its potential to provide new insights into the Earth's core and planetary formation\n    - B: Based on its potential to discover extraterrestrial life\n    - C: Based on its potential to contribute to the development of new medical technologies\n    - D: Based on its potential to study the Earth's atmosphere\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of the instruments on board the spacecraft be evaluated?\n    - A: Based on their ability to collect data and provide insights into 16 Psyche's composition\n    - B: Based on their ability to discover extraterrestrial life\n    - C: Based on their ability to contribute to the development of new medical technologies\n    - D: Based on their ability to study the Earth's atmosphere\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nI removed questions that were not directly related to the key concepts in the transcript and refined the remaining questions to ensure they are clear and concise. I also made sure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. No more refinement needed."
