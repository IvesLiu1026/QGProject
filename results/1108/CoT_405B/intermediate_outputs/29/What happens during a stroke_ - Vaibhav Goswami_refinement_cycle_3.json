    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the body's mass is made up by the brain?\n    - A: 5%\n    - B: 10%\n    - C: 2%\n    - D: 15%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the name of the test used to help identify stroke symptoms?\n    - A: FAST test (Face, Arm, Strength, Time)\n    - B: FAST test (Face, Arm, Speech, Time)\n    - C: Stroke Test (Speech, Time, Arm, Face)\n    - D: Brain Test (Face, Arm, Speech, Time)\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What happens to brain cells when the blood flow to the brain is interrupted?\n    - A: They become dormant\n    - B: They start to multiply\n    - C: They are deprived of oxygen and die\n    - D: They become less active\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) Why is quick medical care critical in treating strokes?\n    - A: To prevent the spread of the disease\n    - B: To reduce the risk of infection\n    - C: To prevent permanent brain damage and reduce the risk of death and disability\n    - D: To reduce the risk of death only\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What should you do if you suspect someone is experiencing a stroke?\n    - A: Call their doctor for an appointment\n    - B: Try to administer first aid\n    - C: Call emergency services immediately\n    - D: Drive them to the hospital\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What are common treatments used by medical professionals to treat strokes?\n    - A: Tissue Plasminogen Activator\n    - B: Endovascular thrombectomy\n    - C: Both A and B\n    - D: Neither A nor B\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How does the brain's reliance on oxygen affect the consequences of interrupted blood flow?\n    - A: The brain's reliance on oxygen has no effect on the consequences of interrupted blood flow\n    - B: The brain's reliance on oxygen decreases the risk of interrupted blood flow\n    - C: The brain's reliance on oxygen makes it more susceptible to damage from interrupted blood flow\n    - D: The brain's reliance on oxygen increases the risk of interrupted blood flow\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the main difference between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes?\n    - A: Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by a clot, while ischemic strokes are caused by bleeding\n    - B: Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding, while ischemic strokes are caused by a clot\n    - C: Hemorrhagic strokes are more common, while ischemic strokes are less common\n    - D: Hemorrhagic strokes are less severe, while ischemic strokes are more severe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the importance of understanding the brain's reliance on oxygen, the consequences of interrupted blood flow, and the importance of prompt medical attention?\n    - A: It helps in the prevention of strokes\n    - B: It aids in the diagnosis of strokes\n    - C: It enables effective treatment of strokes\n    - D: It leads to a deeper understanding of stroke prevention, diagnosis, and treatment\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) Why are public awareness campaigns important in the context of strokes?\n    - A: To educate people on the symptoms of strokes and the need for prompt medical attention\n    - B: To raise funds for stroke research\n    - C: To promote healthy lifestyles\n    - D: To provide support for stroke survivors\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a limitation of the FAST test in identifying stroke symptoms?\n    - A: It is not widely known\n    - B: It is not effective in identifying all types of strokes\n    - C: It is not easy to administer\n    - D: It is not accurate\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the most common cause of death and disability worldwide?\n    - A: Heart disease\n    - B: Stroke\n    - C: Cancer\n    - D: Diabetes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What happens when a clot blocks a vessel in the brain?\n    - A: The vessel expands\n    - B: The vessel constricts\n    - C: The blood flow is interrupted, causing oxygen deprivation\n    - D: The blood flow increases\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) What is the purpose of Tissue Plasminogen Activator in treating strokes?\n    - A: To reduce blood pressure\n    - B: To break up the blood clot\n    - C: To reduce inflammation\n    - D: To improve blood flow\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n15) What is endovascular thrombectomy, and how is it used to treat strokes?\n    - A: It is a medication used to break up blood clots\n    - B: It is a procedure that uses a catheter to remove a blood clot\n    - C: It is a type of surgery used to repair damaged blood vessels\n    - D: It is a test used to diagnose strokes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nI made the following changes:\n\n- Refined question 4 to include both \"permanent brain damage\" and \"reduce the risk of death and disability\" as the correct answer.\n- Refined question 15 to provide a clearer description of endovascular thrombectomy and its use in treating strokes.\n\nNo further refinement is necessary for questions 1-3, 5-14."
