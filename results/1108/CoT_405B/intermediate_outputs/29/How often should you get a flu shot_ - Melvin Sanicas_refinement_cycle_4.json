Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of genetic material does the flu virus contain?\n    - A: DNA\n    - B: RNA\n    - C: Protein\n    - D: Lipid\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Approximately how many subtypes of the influenza virus exist?\n    - A: Over 50\n    - B: Over 100\n    - C: Over 200\n    - D: Over 500\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) Why is the flu virus a challenging target for vaccine development?\n    - A: Because it has a slow mutation rate and a single subtype\n    - B: Because it has a single subtype and is a DNA virus\n    - C: Because it has numerous subtypes and rapid genetic mutations\n    - D: Because it is a DNA virus with a slow mutation rate\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How does the flu vaccine primarily work?\n    - A: By introducing live, attenuated viruses into the body\n    - B: By introducing antigens that trigger the production of antibodies\n    - C: By boosting the immune system with vitamins and minerals\n    - D: By killing infected cells\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can understanding the flu virus's mutation and spread inform?\n    - A: Public health strategies for preventing outbreaks\n    - B: Personal decisions about getting vaccinated\n    - C: Development of a universal flu vaccine\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is the main benefit of herd immunity in the context of flu vaccination?\n    - A: It protects only the individual who gets vaccinated\n    - B: It protects vulnerable members of the community who may not be eligible for vaccination\n    - C: It reduces the severity of flu symptoms\n    - D: It eliminates the need for annual vaccination\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) How does the flu virus's genetic code contribute to its rapid mutation rate?\n    - A: The genetic code is made of DNA, which slows down mutation\n    - B: The genetic code is made of RNA, which lacks a built-in proofreader to correct mistakes\n    - C: The genetic code has no effect on mutation rate\n    - D: The genetic code is made of protein, which stabilizes mutation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the effectiveness of the flu vaccine compare to vaccines for diseases like mumps and rubella?\n    - A: The flu vaccine is more effective\n    - B: The flu vaccine is less effective due to the virus's rapid mutation rate\n    - C: The flu vaccine and mumps and rubella vaccines are equally effective\n    - D: The flu vaccine has no effect, while mumps and rubella vaccines do\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the potential benefit of developing a universal flu vaccine?\n    - A: It would provide lifetime protection against a single subtype of the flu virus\n    - B: It would provide lifetime protection against all subtypes of the flu virus and reduce the need for annual vaccination\n    - C: It would have no significant benefits over current vaccines\n    - D: It would be too expensive to develop\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can integrating understanding of the flu vaccine's mechanism with the idea of a universal flu vaccine inform?\n    - A: Future research and development of the flu vaccine\n    - B: Current vaccination strategies\n    - C: Public health campaigns\n    - D: Personal decisions about getting vaccinated\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential concern with using live, attenuated vaccines in certain populations?\n    - A: They are too expensive\n    - B: They are too effective\n    - C: They may cause infection in individuals with impaired immune systems\n    - D: They are not widely available\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it necessary to update the flu vaccine annually?\n    - A: Because the flu virus has a slow mutation rate\n    - B: Because the flu virus has numerous subtypes and rapid genetic mutations\n    - C: Because the flu vaccine is not effective\n    - D: Because the flu virus is a DNA virus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
