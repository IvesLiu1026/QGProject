Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary composition of fracking fluid?\n    - A: Over 50% water and chemical additives\n    - B: Over 90% water and chemical additives\n    - C: Over 90% chemical additives and water\n    - D: Over 50% chemical additives and water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the average amount of water used per fracking well?\n    - A: 1-2 million gallons\n    - B: 3-6 million gallons\n    - C: 7-10 million gallons\n    - D: 11-15 million gallons\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary purpose of fracking fluid in the hydraulic fracturing process?\n    - A: To cool the drilling equipment\n    - B: To reduce friction and facilitate gas extraction\n    - C: To clean the shale rock formation\n    - D: To dispose of wastewater\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a potential environmental impact of fracking?\n    - A: Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Decrease in air pollution\n    - C: Water contamination and earthquakes\n    - D: Increase in global food production\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A company is planning to extract natural gas using fracking in a remote area. What measure can they implement to minimize environmental impacts?\n    - A: Using a higher concentration of chemical additives\n    - B: Drilling multiple wells in a small area\n    - C: Recycling flow-back liquid and using safer disposal methods\n    - D: Implementing stricter regulations and safety measures\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) A community is considering fracking as an energy source. What should they evaluate when making their decision?\n    - A: Only the economic benefits of fracking\n    - B: Only the environmental drawbacks of fracking\n    - C: The economic and environmental trade-offs of fracking compared to other energy sources\n    - D: The impact of fracking on global climate change\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between fracking and water contamination?\n    - A: Fracking reduces the risk of water contamination\n    - B: Fracking has no impact on water contamination\n    - C: Fracking increases the risk of water contamination due to leakage and inadequate disposal\n    - D: Fracking eliminates the risk of water contamination\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is a contrast between the benefits and drawbacks of fracking?\n    - A: Fracking provides a cleaner-burning fuel but has no environmental concerns\n    - B: Fracking provides a cleaner-burning fuel but has environmental concerns associated with the extraction process\n    - C: Fracking provides a dirty-burning fuel but has no environmental concerns\n    - D: Fracking provides a dirty-burning fuel but has environmental concerns associated with the extraction process\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What role can fracking play in the broader energy landscape?\n    - A: Fracking can replace renewable energy sources\n    - B: Fracking can complement renewable energy sources as a transitional energy source\n    - C: Fracking can only be used in remote areas\n    - D: Fracking has no place in the energy landscape\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What strategy can be developed to mitigate the environmental impacts of fracking?\n    - A: Implementing stricter regulations and safety measures\n    - B: Ignoring environmental concerns and focusing on economic benefits\n    - C: Recycling flow-back liquid but not using safer disposal methods\n    - D: Using a higher concentration of chemical additives\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is necessary to assess the effectiveness of regulations and safety measures in minimizing the environmental impacts of fracking?\n    - A: Evaluating the economic benefits of fracking\n    - B: Evaluating the scientific evidence for and against the use of fracking\n    - C: Assessing the regulations and safety measures in place and their outcomes\n    - D: Conducting regular environmental impact assessments\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is necessary to justify the use of fracking as a transitional energy source?\n    - A: Evaluating the economic benefits of fracking\n    - B: Evaluating the scientific evidence for and against the use of fracking\n    - C: Considering the trade-offs between the economic benefits and environmental costs of fracking\n    - D: Comparing the environmental impacts of fracking to those of other energy sources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
