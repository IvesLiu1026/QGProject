Buoyant is transporting critically endangered fish species to their new aquarium.\n2. The boat is battered by a fierce storm, throwing the cargo overboard.\n3. There are three sectors of the ocean floor where the cargo could have landed.\n4. Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms in the area, including fish and sharks.\n5. The sonar image for Sector Alpha shows four tanks and two sharks, Sector Beta shows two tanks and four sharks, and Sector Gamma is blank.\n6. Each tank had the same number of fish inside.\n7. The cargo hold had space for anywhere from 1 to 13 total tanks.\n8. No two sectors can have the same number of sharks, and every sector will have at least one and no more than seven sharks.\n\n**Comprehension**:\n\n1. The cargo director needs to locate the missing fish tanks in the ocean floor to save the endangered species.\n2. The director uses thermal imaging and sonar to gather information about the location of the tanks and sharks.\n3. The director creates a table to compare multiple pieces of partial information and deduce the number of tanks and fish.\n4. The total number of tanks must be between 6 and 13, and the total number of fish must be divisible by the total number of tanks.\n\n**Application**:\n\n1. The director applies problem-solving skills to locate the missing tanks and save the endangered species.\n2. The director uses mathematical reasoning to deduce the number of tanks and fish based on the available information.\n3. The director considers the constraints of the situation, such as the limited fuel for the rescue sub and the need to find all the tanks in one trip.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. The director identifies the relationships between the number of tanks, fish, and sharks in each sector.\n2. The director recognizes that the number of fish must be divisible by the number of tanks, which helps to narrow down the possible solutions.\n3. The director considers the trade-offs between the number of sharks and fish in each sector, recognizing that more sharks mean fewer fish.\n\n**Synthesis**:\n\n1. The director combines the information from thermal imaging, sonar, and the shipping notes to create a comprehensive understanding of the situation.\n2. The director uses the table to synthesize the information and deduce the number of tanks and fish.\n3. The director recognizes that the solution requires considering multiple factors simultaneously, such as the number of tanks, fish, and sharks.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n1. The director evaluates the available information and determines the most likely solution based on the constraints and relationships between the variables.\n2. The director justifies the solution by considering the trade-offs and relationships between the variables.\n3. The director critiques the initial assumption that there is not enough information to solve the problem, recognizing that a systematic approach can lead to a solution."
