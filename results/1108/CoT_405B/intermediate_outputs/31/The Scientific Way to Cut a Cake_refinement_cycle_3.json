    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the traditional method of cutting a cake commonly referred to as?\n    - A: Classic method\n    - B: French method\n    - C: Radial method\n    - D: British method\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) In which year did a British mathematical scientist propose an alternative method of cutting a cake in the science magazine Nature?\n    - A: 1905\n    - B: 1906\n    - C: 1907\n    - D: 1908\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary goal of the alternative method of cutting a cake proposed by the British scientist?\n    - A: To minimize the time spent cutting the cake\n    - B: To maximize the gastronomic pleasure of eating the cake by keeping it fresh for longer\n    - C: To create a visually appealing cake\n    - D: To reduce the number of slices\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n4) What is the purpose of using rubber bands in the scientist's method of cutting a cake?\n    - A: To decorate the cake\n    - B: To keep the cake together and prevent it from drying out\n    - C: To make the cake easier to cut\n    - D: To add flavor to the cake\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) In which scenario would the alternative method of cutting a cake be particularly useful?\n    - A: A birthday party where the cake is consumed in one day\n    - B: A gathering where the cake is served over multiple days\n    - C: A small gathering where only a few slices are served\n    - D: A cake-tasting event where multiple cakes are served\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific:\n5) In which scenario would the alternative method of cutting a cake be particularly useful?\n    - A: A birthday party where the cake is consumed in one day\n    - B: A gathering where the cake is served over multiple days, such as a small household\n    - C: A large event where the cake is consumed quickly\n    - D: A cake-tasting event where multiple cakes are served\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a benefit of the alternative method of cutting a cake?\n    - A: It allows for more uniform slices\n    - B: It reduces the number of slices\n    - C: It increases the number of slices\n    - D: It makes the cake more visually appealing\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n7) What is the consequence of cutting a cake using the traditional method?\n    - A: The exterior remains fresh, while the interior becomes dry\n    - B: The interior remains fresh, while the exterior becomes dry\n    - C: The entire cake remains fresh\n    - D: The entire cake becomes dry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific:\n7) What is the consequence of cutting a cake using the traditional method and storing it overnight?\n    - A: The exterior remains fresh, while the interior becomes dry\n    - B: The cut surfaces of the cake become dry\n    - C: The entire cake remains fresh\n    - D: The entire cake becomes dry\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the effect of using rubber bands in the scientist's method on the freshness of the cake?\n    - A: The rubber bands cause the cake to dry out faster\n    - B: The rubber bands have no effect on the freshness of the cake\n    - C: The rubber bands prevent the cake from drying out\n    - D: The rubber bands add moisture to the cake\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) How does the scientist's method of cutting a cake compare to the traditional method?\n    - A: It is faster and more convenient\n    - B: It is more visually appealing\n    - C: It preserves the freshness of the cake by minimizing exposure to air\n    - D: It is more cost-effective\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n10) What is a potential application of the scientist's method beyond cutting cakes?\n    - A: Wrapping leftovers\n    - B: Storing food in airtight containers\n    - C: Preserving fruits and vegetables\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nRefined to make the correct answer more specific:\n10) What is a potential application of the scientist's method beyond cutting cakes?\n    - A: Wrapping leftovers to keep them fresh\n    - B: Storing food in airtight containers to preserve flavor\n    - C: Preserving fruits and vegetables by minimizing exposure to air\n    - D: All of the above, as they relate to minimizing exposure to air\n[Correct answer]: D"
