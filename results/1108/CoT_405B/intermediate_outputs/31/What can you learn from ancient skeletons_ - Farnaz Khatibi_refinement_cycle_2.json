    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\n1) Between which years did archeologists excavate the rubble of an ancient hospital in England?\n    - A: 2000-2004\n    - B: 2008-2012\n    - C: 2010-2015\n    - D: 2015-2018\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) At what age do bones, such as the clavicle, typically stop growing?\n    - A: 18\n    - B: 21\n    - C: 25\n    - D: 30\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What information can be gathered from the morphology of a skeleton?\n    - A: Diet and location\n    - B: Age and gender\n    - C: Cultural beliefs and social norms\n    - D: Evolution of diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What can be revealed by examining the condition of teeth?\n    - A: Age and gender\n    - B: Diet and malnutrition\n    - C: Cultural beliefs and social norms\n    - D: Evolution of diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What can analyzing skeletons help researchers understand about populations?\n    - A: The impact of climate change\n    - B: The impact of migration and disease\n    - C: The evolution of languages\n    - D: The development of technology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What insights can be gained from studying ancient skeletons?\n    - A: Cultural beliefs, social norms, and wars\n    - B: Evolution of diseases, climate change, and technology\n    - C: Diet, location, and malnutrition\n    - D: Age, gender, and morphology\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What method can be used to estimate age of death based on bone growth patterns?\n    - A: Pelvic bone structure analysis\n    - B: Isotopic analysis\n    - C: Combining bone growth patterns and microscopic skeletal clues\n    - D: DNA analysis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What information can be inferred from the presence of certain isotopes in bone collagen and tooth enamel?\n    - A: Age and gender\n    - B: Diet and location\n    - C: Cultural beliefs and social norms\n    - D: Evolution of diseases\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What approach can provide a comprehensive understanding of an individual's life and death?\n    - A: Morphology alone\n    - B: Isotopic analysis alone\n    - C: Combining morphology, microscopic skeletal clues, and isotopic analysis\n    - D: DNA analysis alone\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What field of study allows researchers to piece together details about ancient individuals and identify historical events that affected whole populations?\n    - A: Archaeology\n    - B: Biological anthropology\n    - C: History\n    - D: Sociology\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is essential when evaluating the accuracy of age and gender estimates based on skeletal analysis?\n    - A: Considering only morphology\n    - B: Ignoring isotopic analysis\n    - C: Critiquing the limitations of the methods used\n    - D: Relying solely on DNA analysis\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is it essential to critique the limitations of isotopic analysis in determining diet and location?\n    - A: Because it is always accurate\n    - B: Because it is never accurate\n    - C: Because it has limitations that need to be considered\n    - D: Because it is only used for age and gender estimates\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12. However, I have rephrased question 10 to better align with the key concepts in the transcript."
