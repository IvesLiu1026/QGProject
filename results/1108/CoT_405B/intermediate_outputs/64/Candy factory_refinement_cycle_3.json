    "refinement_output": "Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to refine the questions as there is no transcript or specific feedback provided. The initial questions seem to be general and lack context, making it challenging to refine them.\n\nTo refine the questions accurately, I would need the transcript and specific feedback related to the initial questions. If you provide the necessary information, I'll be happy to assist you in refining the questions.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general improvements:\n\n- Ensure each question is specific and focused on a key concept.\n- Use clear and concise language in the question and options.\n- Make sure the distractors are plausible but incorrect.\n- Verify the accuracy of the correct answers.\n\nPlease provide the transcript and specific feedback to proceed with refining the questions."
