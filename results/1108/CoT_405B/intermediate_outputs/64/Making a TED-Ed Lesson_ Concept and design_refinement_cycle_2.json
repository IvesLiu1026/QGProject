Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What material is used to represent cancer cells in the animation?\n    - A: Seeds\n    - B: Lentils\n    - C: Nerds candy\n    - D: Jelly beans\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does a single cell develop into multiple cells?\n    - A: Through cell fusion\n    - B: Through cell division\n    - C: Through cell transformation\n    - D: Through cell regeneration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the purpose of using everyday materials to represent complex biological concepts in the animation?\n    - A: To create a realistic representation\n    - B: To make the concepts more accessible and engaging\n    - C: To demonstrate the complexity of the concepts\n    - D: To use expensive materials\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) Why was computer editing used to change the hue of the candy in the animation?\n    - A: To make it appear more realistic\n    - B: To make it appear more toxic and represent cancer cells\n    - C: To make it appear more colorful\n    - D: To make it appear more natural\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is an effective way to teach students about cell division and its relationship to cancer?\n    - A: Using complex scientific jargon\n    - B: Using creative materials and visual aids\n    - C: Using only textbooks and lectures\n    - D: Using only computer simulations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What concept is essential to understanding the development and spread of diseases?\n    - A: Cell fusion\n    - B: Cell division\n    - C: Cell transformation\n    - D: Cell regeneration\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the main contrast between healthy and cancer cells in the animation?\n    - A: The use of same materials\n    - B: The use of different colors\n    - C: The use of different materials (seeds vs. candy)\n    - D: The use of same colors\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between cell division and the formation of tissues and organs?\n    - A: Cell division leads to the breakdown of tissues and organs\n    - B: Cell division leads to the formation of tissues and organs\n    - C: Cell division has no relation to the formation of tissues and organs\n    - D: Cell division only leads to the formation of tissues\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is an effective way to create a comprehensive understanding of human biology and disease?\n    - A: By only studying cell division\n    - B: By only studying tissues and organs\n    - C: By combining the concepts of cell division, tissues, and organs\n    - D: By only studying cancer cells\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is an effective way to create a visually striking representation of biological concepts?\n    - A: By only using traditional materials\n    - B: By only using computer editing\n    - C: By integrating traditional materials with computer editing\n    - D: By only using textbooks and lectures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is the main criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of using everyday materials to represent complex biological concepts?\n    - A: The cost of the materials\n    - B: The accessibility of the materials\n    - C: The ability to convey complex concepts in a simple and engaging way\n    - D: The realism of the materials\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What justifies the choice of materials and colors used in the animation?\n    - A: The materials and colors are expensive\n    - B: The materials and colors are realistic\n    - C: The materials and colors effectively convey the contrast between healthy and cancer cells\n    - D: The materials and colors are randomly chosen\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
