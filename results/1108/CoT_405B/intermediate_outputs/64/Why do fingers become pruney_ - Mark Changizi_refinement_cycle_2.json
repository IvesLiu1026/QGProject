    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) When was the observation of pruney fingers first made, and in what context?\n    - A: 1920s in a laboratory\n    - B: 1930s in an emergency room\n    - C: 1940s in a field study\n    - D: 1950s in a clinical trial\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is a characteristic of river networks on concave basins?\n    - A: Channels that diverge away from each other downstream\n    - B: Smaller channels joining to make larger channels downstream\n    - C: Channels that remain constant in size downstream\n    - D: Channels that only flow uphill\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a concept that explains the function of pruney fingers?\n    - A: They are an adaptation for primates to grip objects in dry conditions\n    - B: They are similar to rain treads on car tires, helping to channel out water\n    - C: They are a result of nerve damage to the hands\n    - D: They are only found in individuals who frequently engage in water sports\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is a comparison made between pruney fingers and another natural phenomenon?\n    - A: River networks on convex promontories and the shape of pruney fingers\n    - B: The shape of pruney fingers and the shape of snowflakes\n    - C: The function of pruney fingers and the function of the human nose\n    - D: The development of pruney fingers and the development of the human eye\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) How can the concept of pruney fingers be applied to outdoor activities?\n    - A: By using gloves that prevent pruney fingers from forming\n    - B: By understanding how pruney fingers can improve grip in wet conditions\n    - C: By avoiding activities that involve water or moisture\n    - D: By using tools that do not require grip or dexterity\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential application of the concept of rain treads?\n    - A: Designing shoes with smooth soles for better grip on dry roads\n    - B: Manufacturing tires with treads for better grip on wet roads\n    - C: Creating clothing with built-in umbrellas for rainy days\n    - D: Developing a new type of bicycle pedal\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is a relationship between the shape of pruney fingers and their function?\n    - A: The shape of pruney fingers is unrelated to their function\n    - B: The shape of pruney fingers helps to channel out water, improving grip\n    - C: The shape of pruney fingers is only aesthetically pleasing\n    - D: The shape of pruney fingers is a result of nerve damage\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is a contrast between river networks on concave basins and convex promontories?\n    - A: River networks on concave basins have channels that diverge away from each other downstream, while those on convex promontories have channels that join together\n    - B: River networks on concave basins have channels that join together downstream, while those on convex promontories have channels that diverge away from each other\n    - C: River networks on concave basins and convex promontories have the same type of channels\n    - D: River networks on concave basins and convex promontories do not exist\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a new understanding that can be gained by combining the concept of pruney fingers with the concept of river networks?\n    - A: Pruney fingers are an adaptation for primates to grip objects in dry conditions\n    - B: The shape and function of pruney fingers can be understood by comparing them to river networks on convex promontories\n    - C: Pruney fingers are a result of nerve damage to the hands\n    - D: The concept of pruney fingers is unrelated to the concept of river networks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is a new understanding that can be gained by integrating the concept of pruney fingers with the concept of evolutionary adaptations?\n    - A: Pruney fingers are an adaptation for primates to grip objects in wet conditions, and their development can be understood through the lens of evolutionary adaptations\n    - B: Pruney fingers are a result of nerve damage to the hands, and their development is unrelated to evolutionary adaptations\n    - C: The concept of pruney fingers is unrelated to the concept of evolutionary adaptations\n    - D: Pruney fingers are only found in individuals who frequently engage in water sports\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a potential critique of the idea that pruney fingers are an adaptation for primates?\n    - A: The idea is well-supported by scientific evidence and requires no critique\n    - B: The idea is too simplistic and does not take into account other factors that may have contributed to the development of pruney fingers\n    - C: The idea is irrelevant to the field of biology and should not be studied further\n    - D: The idea is too complex and should be abandoned in favor of simpler explanations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential evaluation of the effectiveness of pruney fingers in improving grip in wet conditions?\n    - A: Pruney fingers are completely ineffective in improving grip in wet conditions\n    - B: Pruney fingers are somewhat effective in improving grip in wet conditions, but their effectiveness is limited\n    - C: Pruney fingers are highly effective in improving grip in wet conditions, and their development is a clear example of evolutionary adaptation\n    - D: The effectiveness of pruney fingers in improving grip in wet conditions is unknown and requires further study\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
