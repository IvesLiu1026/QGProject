    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, enhance clarity and conciseness, and confirm distractors are plausible but incorrect. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Who discovered nearly 3,000 tablets inscribed with strange symbols on the island of Crete in the early 1900s?\n    - A: Alice Kober\n    - B: Michael Ventris\n    - C: Sir Arthur Evans\n    - D: King Minos\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What was the name given to the script discovered on the tablets in the palace of Knossos?\n    - A: Linear A\n    - B: Linear B\n    - C: Cypriot Script\n    - D: Minoan Script\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What significant insight did Alice Kober gain from analyzing the symbols and their frequencies in Linear B?\n    - A: She discovered that Linear B was a logographic script.\n    - B: She found that Linear B relied on word endings to give its sentences grammar.\n    - C: She determined that Linear B was an alphabet.\n    - D: She realized that Linear B was a pictorial script.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What was the outcome of deciphering Linear B, and how did it impact our understanding of history?\n    - A: It confirmed the Minoans conquered the mainland Greeks.\n    - B: It revealed Linear B represented a previously unknown language.\n    - C: It rewrote a chapter of history by showing Linear B represented Greek, not Minoan.\n    - D: It had no significant impact on our understanding of history.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What does the deciphering of Linear B demonstrate about collaboration and problem-solving?\n    - A: The importance of individual effort in solving complex problems.\n    - B: The significance of interdisciplinary collaboration in solving complex problems.\n    - C: The need for a single, dominant field of study in solving complex problems.\n    - D: The irrelevance of mathematical concepts in linguistics.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) How does the deciphering of Linear B highlight the significance of preserving and studying ancient languages and scripts?\n    - A: By showing that ancient languages and scripts are irrelevant to modern society.\n    - B: By demonstrating that ancient languages and scripts can provide new insights into human history and culture.\n    - C: By revealing that ancient languages and scripts are too complex to be deciphered.\n    - D: By suggesting that ancient languages and scripts should only be studied by experts in the field.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What was the significance of comparing the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos in deciphering Linear B?\n    - A: It revealed the tablets from Pylos and Knossos were identical.\n    - B: It showed the tablets from Pylos and Knossos were written in different languages.\n    - C: It led Ventris to suspect that certain words represented place names.\n    - D: It confirmed the tablets from Pylos and Knossos were written in the same language.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How did the similarity between the Cypriot script and Linear B symbols contribute to deciphering Linear B?\n    - A: It led Ventris to wonder if the sounds would be similar, too.\n    - B: It revealed the Cypriot script and Linear B symbols were identical.\n    - C: It showed the Cypriot script and Linear B symbols were unrelated.\n    - D: It confirmed the Cypriot script was a later development of Linear B.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n9) What was the outcome of combining Kober's analysis and Ventris' comparison of the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos?\n    - A: It led to a deeper understanding of the Minoan civilization.\n    - B: It resulted in the deciphering of Linear B.\n    - C: It revealed Linear B represented a previously unknown language.\n    - D: It confirmed the Minoans conquered the mainland Greeks.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What does the deciphering of Linear B demonstrate about the power of interdisciplinary collaboration?\n    - A: That interdisciplinary collaboration is unnecessary in solving complex problems.\n    - B: That interdisciplinary collaboration can lead to new insights and discoveries.\n    - C: That interdisciplinary collaboration is only relevant in the field of linguistics.\n    - D: That interdisciplinary collaboration is too complex to be effective.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) How can Evans' decision to guard the tablets closely and only publish 200 of the inscriptions during his lifetime be evaluated?\n    - A: As a positive decision that accelerated the deciphering process.\n    - B: As a negative decision that hindered the deciphering process.\n    - C: As a neutral decision that had no impact on the deciphering process.\n    - D: As an irrelevant decision that had no bearing on the deciphering process.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the significance of the discovery that Linear B represented Greek, not Minoan, in terms of its impact on our understanding of ancient history?\n    - A: It confirms the Minoans conquered the mainland Greeks.\n    - B: It reveals the Minoans and Greeks had a previously unknown relationship.\n    - C: It challenges our previous understanding of the relationships between different civilizations in ancient Greece.\n    - D: It has no significant impact on our understanding of ancient history.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo major changes were necessary, but minor adjustments were made to enhance clarity and conciseness. The questions are now more refined and accurate, with plausible but incorrect distractors."
