    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.\n\n1) What is the estimated number of words an average 20-year-old knows?\n    - A: 10,000-20,000\n    - B: 27,000-52,000\n    - C: 50,000-70,000\n    - D: 80,000-100,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Where are new words initially stored in the brain before transferring to the cortex?\n    - A: Cerebellum\n    - B: Hippocampus\n    - C: Cerebral cortex\n    - D: Brainstem\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) How does the brain assess the likelihood of incoming speech matching a particular word?\n    - A: Using a single processing unit for all words\n    - B: Utilizing separate processing units for each word\n    - C: Relying on a combination of auditory and visual cues\n    - D: Depending solely on contextual information\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) How does the brain handle multiple possible meanings of a word during the recognition process?\n    - A: By selecting the most common meaning\n    - B: By accessing multiple meanings simultaneously before full identification\n    - C: By ignoring ambiguous words\n    - D: By relying solely on context\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) What is a potential application of understanding how the brain processes speech?\n    - A: Improving language learning and teaching methods\n    - B: Developing more efficient reading comprehension strategies\n    - C: Enhancing memory recall\n    - D: Improving cognitive abilities in general\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n6) How can the concept of parallel processing be applied in technology?\n    - A: Developing more efficient computer processors\n    - B: Improving artificial intelligence and speech recognition technology\n    - C: Enhancing data storage capacity\n    - D: Creating more realistic virtual reality experiences\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brain's parallel processing and speech comprehension?\n    - A: Parallel processing hinders speech comprehension\n    - B: Parallel processing has no effect on speech comprehension\n    - C: Parallel processing facilitates speech comprehension\n    - D: Parallel processing is only involved in reading comprehension\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the primary effect of context on word recognition?\n    - A: Context slows down word recognition\n    - B: Context has no impact on word recognition\n    - C: Context helps guide the recognition process and eliminate potential words\n    - D: Context is only important for reading comprehension\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What is the role of sleep in integrating new words into the brain's word network?\n    - A: Sleep has no impact on word integration\n    - B: Sleep helps consolidate new words into the brain's word network\n    - C: Sleep is only important for language acquisition in children\n    - D: Sleep hinders language learning and memory consolidation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) How do parallel processing and context combine to facilitate speech comprehension?\n    - A: Parallel processing and context work independently to facilitate speech comprehension\n    - B: Parallel processing and context work together to facilitate speech comprehension\n    - C: Parallel processing is only involved in reading comprehension, while context is only involved in speech comprehension\n    - D: Parallel processing and context hinder speech comprehension\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of artificial intelligence in speech recognition compared to human language processing?\n    - A: Artificial intelligence is too slow\n    - B: Artificial intelligence lacks the ability to process speech in parallel\n    - C: Artificial intelligence is too expensive\n    - D: Artificial intelligence is too complex\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is context important in language comprehension and communication?\n    - A: Context is only important for reading comprehension\n    - B: Context helps guide the recognition process and eliminate potential words\n    - C: Context is only important for language acquisition in children\n    - D: Context hinders language learning and memory consolidation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo major changes were made to the questions, as they align with the key concepts in the transcript and are clear, concise, and accurate. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate. Therefore, no further refinement is necessary.\n\nNo more refinement needed."
