A: By creating new biodegradable plastics\n    - B: By increasing the use of plastics in packaging\n    - C: By replacing traditional materials like wood and fabric with plastics\n    - D: By applying plastic recycling technologies, reducing plastic waste, and developing biodegradable plastics\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is an example of integrating plastic recycling technologies with existing manufacturing processes?\n    - A: Developing new products using plastics, such as plastic garbage bags\n    - B: Using plastics in packaging to keep food fresh\n    - C: Reducing waste by incorporating recycled plastics into the manufacturing process\n    - D: Replacing traditional materials like wood and fabric with plastics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a justification for the use of plastics in specific applications?\n    - A: Plastics are cheaper than traditional materials\n    - B: Plastics are more durable than traditional materials\n    - C: Plastics can provide a sterile and shatter-proof alternative to traditional materials\n    - D: Plastics can only be used in medical equipment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is a critique of the role of plastics in modern society?\n    - A: Plastics have only brought convenience and cost-effectiveness\n    - B: Plastics have no significant impact on the environment\n    - C: Plastics have contributed to significant environmental problems, such as pollution and waste\n    - D: Plastics are only used in medical equipment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined Questions 13-15:\n\n13) What is the primary characteristic that defines plastics?\n    - A: They are made from renewable resources\n    - B: They are made from non-renewable resources\n    - C: They start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape\n    - D: They are always biodegradable\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) How did World War II influence the development and use of plastics?\n    - A: It led to a decrease in plastic production\n    - B: It led to an increase in plastic production for consumer goods\n    - C: It led to an increase in plastic production for military equipment and supplies\n    - D: It had no impact on the development and use of plastics\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n15) What is a potential solution to address the environmental problems caused by plastics?\n    - A: Increasing the use of plastics in packaging\n    -
