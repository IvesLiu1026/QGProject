    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall of Specific Facts)**\n\n1. The last two known northern white rhinos are Nájin and Fatu, both female.\n2. The species is functionally extinct due to the lack of a male.\n3. Poachers began hunting rhinos for their horns about 50 years ago.\n4. Conservationists started breeding northern white rhinos in captivity in the 1970s.\n5. Only four rhinos were born through the breeding program, with Nájin and Fatu being the last two.\n6. Nájin has weak hindlegs, and Fatu has a degenerated uterine lining, making them unable to carry a pregnancy.\n7. The last northern white rhino male, Sudan, died in 2018.\n8. Scientists have stored semen from northern white rhino males.\n9. The southern white rhino is a closely related species to the northern white rhino.\n10. The two species diverged about a million years ago.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding and Interpretation)**\n\n1. The northern white rhino species is at risk of extinction due to poaching and civil wars.\n2. Conservation efforts, including breeding in captivity and artificial reproduction, are being made to revive the species.\n3. The process of artificial reproduction involves collecting eggs from females, creating a viable embryo in the lab, and using a surrogate mother from another rhino species.\n4. The southern white rhino is being used as a surrogate mother due to its close relation to the northern white rhino.\n5. The ultimate goal is to establish a breeding population of northern white rhinos in their original range.\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1. The use of artificial reproduction techniques to revive endangered species.\n2. The importance of conservation efforts to protect species from extinction.\n3. The potential for using surrogate mothers from closely related species to carry embryos of endangered species.\n4. The application of genetic diversity studies to recreate a population with the same genetic diversity as the original species.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, Contrasts, Cause-and-Effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between poaching and the decline of the northern white rhino population.\n2. The contrast between the northern white rhino and the southern white rhino, including their physical traits and habitats.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the lack of a male northern white rhino and the species' functional extinction.\n4. The relationship between human actions (poaching, civil wars) and the decline of the northern white rhino population.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas to Form New Understanding)**\n\n1. The combination of artificial reproduction techniques and conservation efforts to revive the northern white rhino species.\n2. The use of genetic diversity studies to inform the recreation of a breeding population.\n3. The potential for applying the techniques used to revive the northern white rhino to other endangered species.\n4. The consideration of the ethics and responsibilities involved in bringing species back from the brink of extinction.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, Critique, Justification)**\n\n1. The justification for expending effort and resources on saving animals threatened with extinction.\n2. The evaluation of the ethics involved in using artificial reproduction techniques to revive a species.\n3. The critique of human actions that contribute to the decline of species and the importance of conservation efforts.\n4. The consideration of the limits to the effort that should be expended on saving animals threatened with extinction."
