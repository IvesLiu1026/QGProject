    "initial_questions": "Here are two multiple-choice questions for each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1) What is the Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory?\n    - A: A scenario where two rational individuals must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other.\n    - B: A strategy where neither player can gain by deviating from their chosen action.\n    - C: A variation of the game where the players must repeat the scenario indefinitely.\n    - D: A concept that represents how much players value their future outcomes compared to their present outcomes.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) What is the Nash Equilibrium in game theory?\n    - A: A strategy where one player can gain by deviating from their chosen action.\n    - B: A scenario where two rational individuals must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other.\n    - C: A strategy where neither player can gain by deviating from their chosen action.\n    - D: A variation of the game where the players must repeat the scenario indefinitely.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1) What does the Prisoner's Dilemma illustrate in terms of individual self-interest and collective well-being?\n    - A: The alignment of individual self-interest and collective well-being.\n    - B: The conflict between individual self-interest and collective well-being.\n    - C: The irrelevance of individual self-interest and collective well-being.\n    - D: The equivalence of individual self-interest and collective well-being.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the effect of the discount factor (delta) on players' decisions in the Infinite Prisoner's Dilemma?\n    - A: Higher values of delta lead to more selfishness, while lower values lead to more cooperation.\n    - B: Higher values of delta lead to more cooperation, while lower values lead to more selfishness.\n    - C: The discount factor (delta) has no effect on players' decisions.\n    - D: The discount factor (delta) only affects the outcome of the game, not the players' decisions.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1) Which of the following is an example of a real-life situation where the Prisoner's Dilemma can be applied?\n    - A: A business partnership where both partners have aligned interests.\n    - B: A trade negotiation between two countries with competing interests.\n    - C: A social dilemma where individuals have no conflicting interests.\n    - D: A financial decision-making scenario where individuals have complete information.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How can the concept of delta be used in environmental policy?\n    - A: To model how individuals value their present outcomes compared to their future outcomes.\n    - B: To study the emergence of cooperation in repeated interactions.\n    - C: To model how individuals value their future outcomes compared to their present outcomes.\n    - D: To evaluate the stability of cooperation in repeated interactions.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and contrasts)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the Nash Equilibrium and the optimal outcome for both players in the Prisoner's Dilemma?\n    - A: The Nash Equilibrium is always the optimal outcome for both players.\n    - B: The Nash Equilibrium is never the optimal outcome for both players.\n    - C: The Nash Equilibrium may not be the optimal outcome for both players.\n    - D: The Nash Equilibrium is irrelevant to the optimal outcome for both players.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) How does the value of delta affect the emergence of cooperation in the Infinite Prisoner's Dilemma?\n    - A: Higher values of delta lead to less cooperation, while lower values lead to more cooperation.\n    - B: Higher values of delta lead to more cooperation, while lower values lead to less cooperation.\n    - C: The value of delta has no effect on the emergence of cooperation.\n    - D: The value of delta only affects the outcome of the game, not the emergence of cooperation.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1) How can the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Infinite Prisoner's Dilemma be combined to study the emergence of cooperation?\n    - A: By analyzing the Nash Equilibrium in both scenarios.\n    - B: By studying the effect of delta on players' decisions in both scenarios.\n    - C: By examining the tension between individual self-interest and collective well-being in both scenarios.\n    - D: By combining the two scenarios to study the emergence of cooperation in repeated interactions.\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) How can the concept of delta be used to model how individuals value their future outcomes in various contexts?\n    - A: By analyzing the Nash Equilibrium in different scenarios.\n    - B: By studying the effect of delta on players' decisions in different scenarios.\n    - C: By applying the concept of delta to different contexts, such as financial decision-making or environmental policy.\n    - D: By evaluating the stability of cooperation in different scenarios.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and critique)**\n\n1) What moral question does the Prisoner's Dilemma raise about individual self-interest and collective well-being?\n    - A: Whether individual self-interest should always be prioritized over collective well-being.\n    - B: Whether collective well-being should always be prioritized over individual self-interest.\n    - C: Whether individual self-interest should be prioritized over collective well-being in certain situations.\n    - D: Whether the Prisoner's Dilemma is a morally relevant scenario.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the importance of considering the long-term consequences of one's actions in the Infinite Prisoner's Dilemma?\n    - A: It is irrelevant to the outcome of the game.\n    - B: It is only relevant to the outcome of the game, not to the players' decisions.\n    - C: It is crucial to the emergence of cooperation in repeated interactions.\n    - D: It is only relevant to the Nash Equilibrium, not to the players' decisions.\n[Correct answer]: C"
