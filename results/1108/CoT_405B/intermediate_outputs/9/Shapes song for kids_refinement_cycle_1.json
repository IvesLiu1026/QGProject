    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is a characteristic of a circle?\n    - A: It has four equal sides.\n    - B: It has one continuous curved line.\n    - C: It has three sides.\n    - D: It has four sides with two shorter sides.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) How many sides does a triangle have?\n    - A: 2\n    - B: 3\n    - C: 4\n    - D: 5\n[Correct answer]: B (No refinement needed)\n\n3) What is a key way to identify different shapes?\n    - A: By their color\n    - B: By their size\n    - C: By their characteristics, such as the number of sides\n    - D: By their texture\n[Correct answer]: C (No refinement needed)\n\n4) Where can shapes be found?\n    - A: Only in art and design\n    - B: Only in architecture\n    - C: Everywhere in our surroundings\n    - D: Only in puzzles and games\n[Correct answer]: C (No refinement needed)\n\n5) What shape is commonly associated with a stop sign?\n    - A: Triangle\n    - B: Square\n    - C: Circle\n    - D: Octagon\n[Correct answer]: D (This question doesn't align with the transcript. Consider removing or replacing it.)\n\n6) Which of the following is an example of using shapes in art, design, or architecture?\n    - A: Solving a math problem\n    - B: Writing a story\n    - C: Designing a building with geometric shapes\n    - D: Playing a sport\n[Correct answer]: C (No refinement needed)\n\n7) What is a key difference between a square and a rectangle?\n    - A: A square has four sides, while a rectangle has three.\n    - B: A square has equal sides, while a rectangle has two shorter sides.\n    - C: A square is larger than a rectangle.\n    - D: A square is smaller than a rectangle.\n[Correct answer]: B (No refinement needed)\n\n8) What is the relationship between a square and a rectangle?\n    - A: A square is a type of triangle.\n    - B: A square is a type of circle.\n    - C: A square is a type of rectangle with equal sides.\n    - D: A square is not related to a rectangle.\n[Correct answer]: C (No refinement needed)\n\n9) What can be created by combining different shapes?\n    - A: A new color\n    - B: A new texture\n    - C: A new design or pattern\n    - D: A new size\n[Correct answer]: C (This question doesn't align with the transcript. Consider removing or replacing it.)\n\n10) How can shapes be used to represent real-world objects or concepts?\n    - A: By using a square to represent a circle\n    - B: By using a circle to represent the sun\n    - C: By using a triangle to represent a square\n    - D: By using a rectangle to represent a triangle\n[Correct answer]: B (This question doesn't align with the transcript. Consider removing or replacing it.)\n\n11) What is a key factor in judging whether a shape is symmetrical or asymmetrical?\n    - A: Its color\n    - B: Its size\n    - C: Its balance and proportion\n    - D: Its texture\n[Correct answer]: C (This question doesn't align with the transcript. Consider removing or replacing it.)\n\n12) Why might a particular shape be chosen for a specific purpose or application?\n    - A: Because it is the largest shape\n    - B: Because it is the smallest shape\n    - C: Because it is the most aesthetically pleasing shape\n    - D: Because it is the most functional shape for the purpose\n[Correct answer]: D (This question doesn't align with the transcript. Consider removing or replacing it.)\n\nConsider removing or replacing questions 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they don't align with the transcript. The remaining questions are refined and ready for use."
