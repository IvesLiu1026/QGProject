    "content_analysis": "Based on the provided transcript, here's the key information categorized under each Bloom's Taxonomy level:\n\n**1. Knowledge:**\n- A circle has one line that goes round and round.\n- A triangle has three sides.\n- A square has four equal sides.\n- A rectangle has four sides, with two sides being shorter.\n\n**2. Comprehension:**\n- Shapes can be identified based on their characteristics (e.g., number of sides, shape of lines).\n- Different shapes have distinct features that set them apart from one another.\n- Shapes can be found everywhere in our surroundings.\n\n**3. Application:**\n- Recognizing shapes in real-life objects or environments (e.g., identifying a stop sign as an octagon or a yield sign as a triangle).\n- Using shapes in art, design, or architecture.\n- Solving puzzles or playing games that involve identifying and manipulating shapes.\n\n**4. Analysis:**\n- Comparing and contrasting different shapes (e.g., a square vs. a rectangle).\n- Identifying the relationships between shapes (e.g., a square is a type of rectangle with equal sides).\n- Understanding how shapes can be combined to form more complex shapes or patterns.\n\n**5. Synthesis:**\n- Combining different shapes to create new designs or patterns.\n- Using shapes to represent real-world objects or concepts (e.g., using a circle to represent the sun).\n- Creating new shapes by modifying or combining existing shapes.\n\n**6. Evaluation:**\n- Judging whether a shape is symmetrical or asymmetrical.\n- Critiquing the use of shapes in art, design, or architecture.\n- Justifying the choice of a particular shape for a specific purpose or application.\n\nThese categories will serve as a foundation for creating assessment questions that target various cognitive skills and levels of understanding."
