There are 60 bees left in the species.\n3. Bees can fill hexes with wax in two ways: by being placed in them or by transforming them when three or more neighboring hexes are wax-filled.\n4. A bee cannot be removed from a hex without killing it.\n5. A queen bee can be created by placing an additional bee in a fully transformed hive.\n6. The perimeter of the entire hive is 54.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The goal is to create as many viable hives as possible with the 60 remaining bees to prevent the species from going extinct.\n2. The bees will transform hexes with three or more neighboring wax-filled hexes, creating a chain reaction.\n3. The total perimeter of the transformed hexes will either stay the same or shrink.\n4. To transform the entire hive, the total perimeter of the hexes with bees at the start must be at least 54.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The concept of creating a chain reaction to fill the hive can be applied to real-world problems involving self-sustaining systems.\n2. The idea of minimizing the number of bees needed to transform a hive can be applied to resource optimization problems.\n3. The strategy of placing bees in specific hexes to create a chain reaction can be applied to problems involving spatial planning and optimization.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the number of bees and the size of the hive is analyzed to determine the minimum number of bees needed to transform the entire hive.\n2. The effect of adding or removing bees from the hive on the chain reaction is analyzed.\n3. The trade-off between the number of bees used and the risk of collapse is analyzed.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The idea of using a chain reaction to fill the hive is combined with the concept of minimizing the number of bees needed to create a viable strategy.\n2. The pattern of placing bees in specific hexes to create a chain reaction is extended to larger hives.\n3. The concept of creating multiple hives to prevent the species from going extinct is combined with the strategy of using a chain reaction to fill the hive.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The decision to prioritize creating multiple hives over using a single hive with 59 bees is evaluated based on the risk of collapse.\n2. The effectiveness of the strategy of placing bees in specific hexes to create a chain reaction is evaluated based on the outcome.\n3. The trade-off between the number of bees used and the number of hives created is evaluated based on the goal of preventing the species from going extinct."
