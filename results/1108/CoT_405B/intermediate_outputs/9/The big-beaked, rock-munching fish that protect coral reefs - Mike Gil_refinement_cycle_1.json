    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What percentage of the ocean floor do coral reefs occupy?\n    - A: Approximately 5%\n    - B: Approximately 10%\n    - C: Less than 0.1%\n    - D: Less than 1%\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n2) What is unique about the teeth of parrotfish?\n    - A: They are very sharp and loosely packed\n    - B: They are very small and not very effective\n    - C: They are similar to those of other fish\n    - D: They are tightly packed and form a mosaic\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What is the primary role of parrotfish in the coral reef ecosystem?\n    - A: To provide food for other fish\n    - B: To control seaweed growth\n    - C: To build coral reefs\n    - D: To maintain the balance of the ecosystem through social networks\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is one of the benefits of coral reefs to human life?\n    - A: They provide a source of pollution\n    - B: They support sustainable fishing practices\n    - C: They protect coastlines from waves and storm surges\n    - D: They are a barrier to ecotourism\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A coral reef is experiencing high levels of seaweed growth. What could be a potential solution?\n    - A: Introducing more polluting activities\n    - B: Reducing the number of parrotfish\n    - C: Implementing sustainable fishing practices\n    - D: Increasing the number of seaweed-eating fish\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What could be a consequence of overfishing parrotfish in a coral reef ecosystem?\n    - A: An increase in coral growth\n    - B: A decrease in seaweed growth\n    - C: An increase in seaweed growth\n    - D: A decrease in pollution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do the interactions between parrotfish, coral, and seaweed affect the balance of the coral reef ecosystem?\n    - A: They have no impact on the ecosystem\n    - B: They lead to an increase in coral growth and a decrease in seaweed growth\n    - C: They lead to a decrease in coral growth and an increase in seaweed growth\n    - D: They help maintain a balance between coral and seaweed growth\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the relationship between human activities and the decline of coral reefs?\n    - A: Human activities have no impact on coral reefs\n    - B: Human activities have contributed to the growth of coral reefs\n    - C: Human activities have contributed to the decline of coral reefs\n    - D: Human activities have no relationship with coral reefs\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can the understanding of parrotfish behavior and the social networks of coral-dwelling fish be used to develop new strategies for preserving coral reefs?\n    - A: By reducing the number of parrotfish\n    - B: By introducing more polluting activities\n    - C: By developing targeted conservation efforts\n    - D: By studying the behavior of other fish species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What could be a potential benefit of combining scientific research and conservation efforts to protect coral reefs?\n    - A: A decrease in coral growth\n    - B: An increase in seaweed growth\n    - C: A better understanding of coral reef ecosystems and more effective conservation efforts\n    - D: An increase in pollution\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What are the ethical implications of overfishing and pollution on coral reef ecosystems?\n    - A: They are justified because they support economic growth\n    - B: They are justified because they have no impact on the ecosystem\n    - C: They are not justified because they harm the ecosystem and have negative impacts on human life\n    - D: They are not justified because they lead to an increase in coral growth\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) How can the effectiveness of conservation efforts be evaluated and justified?\n    - A: By measuring the increase in pollution\n    - B: By measuring the decrease in coral growth\n    - C: By measuring the health of the coral reef ecosystem and the impacts on human life\n    - D: By studying the behavior of other fish species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nThese refined questions should better assess the understanding of the key concepts in the transcript and provide a more accurate evaluation of the learner's knowledge."
