Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What unique adaptation allows the armored catfish to breathe on land?\n    - A: Modified gills that can absorb oxygen from the air\n    - B: A stomach packed with blood vessels that can absorb oxygen from gulped air\n    - C: Thin, permeable skin that allows for gas exchange\n    - D: Well-developed lungs similar to those of tetrapods\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Why do California grunion make their annual onshore voyage?\n    - A: To escape ocean predators\n    - B: To forage for food on land\n    - C: To deposit eggs into the sand as part of their reproductive cycle\n    - D: To migrate to a new aquatic habitat\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) How do mudskippers prevent dehydration when on land?\n    - A: By forming a mucus cocoon around their body\n    - B: By using their powerful fins to move quickly and find water\n    - C: By increasing their metabolic rate to conserve water\n    - D: By rolling in the mud to maintain moisture\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n4) What unique feature allows the Nopoli rock-climbing goby to navigate its environment?\n    - A: Alternately attaching suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins\n    - B: Using its taste buds to sense nearby water\n    - C: Exercising its inner ear to determine its orientation on a slope\n    - D: Employing electroreception to detect its surroundings\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What advantage do amphibious fishes have over purely aquatic species?\n    - A: Enhanced protection from predators\n    - B: Increased access to aquatic food sources\n    - C: Ability to escape competitive, polluted, or unhealthy environments and access new prey\n    - D: Improved buoyancy in water\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) Why does the mangrove rivulus move onto land?\n    - A: To escape predators\n    - B: To find food\n    - C: To regulate its body temperature\n    - D: To reproduce\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do lungfish prevent dehydration when on land?\n    - A: By forming a mucus cocoon around their body\n    - B: By using their powerful fins to move quickly and find water\n    - C: By increasing their metabolic rate to conserve water\n    - D: By burying themselves in the earth and coating their body in a mucus cocoon\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What sense do walking catfish use to navigate their environment?\n    - A: Vision\n    - B: Hearing\n    - C: Taste\n    - D: Smell\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed. The provided questions are clear, concise, and accurately reflect the key concepts in the transcript. The distractors are plausible but incorrect, and the correct answers are accurate."
