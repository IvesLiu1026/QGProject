    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Billiard balls were originally made of ivory from elephant tusks.\n2. John Wesley Hyatt invented celluloid in 1863.\n3. Celluloid is made from cellulose, a compound found in wood and straw.\n4. The first synthetic plastic was celluloid.\n5. The word \"plastic\" describes any material made of polymers.\n6. Bakelite was invented in 1907 by combining phenol and formaldehyde.\n7. Various types of plastics were developed in the 20th century, including polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, acrylics, nylon, and polyethylene.\n8. Injection-moulding is a technique used to produce plastics.\n9. Plastic production quadrupled in the United States during World War Two.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The development of plastics was initially driven by the need for an alternative to ivory for billiard balls.\n2. Celluloid, although not suitable for billiard balls, could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive materials.\n3. The term \"plastic\" generally refers to synthetic materials that can be molded into a particular shape.\n4. The invention of new plastics and manufacturing technologies led to an explosion of new products and possibilities.\n5. Plastics were initially seen as a way to make items more affordable and accessible, but ultimately led to environmental problems.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. Using plastics in packaging to keep food and other products fresh for longer.\n2. Replacing traditional materials like wood, glass, and fabric with plastics in various products.\n3. Developing new products and technologies using plastics, such as plastic helmet liners, vinyl raincoats, and plexiglass.\n4. Using plastics in medical applications, such as shatter-proof panels and resilient nylon.\n5. Reducing plastic use, developing biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways to recycle existing plastic to address environmental problems.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between the decline of elephant populations and the development of plastics.\n2. The contrast between the initial goal of making items more affordable and accessible, and the ultimate environmental consequences of plastic use.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the invention of new plastics and manufacturing technologies, and the explosion of new products and possibilities.\n4. The impact of World War Two on the development and production of plastics.\n5. The relationship between the properties of plastics (e.g. non-renewable resources, single-use, non-biodegradable) and the environmental problems they create.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. Combining the need for sustainable materials with the properties of plastics to develop biodegradable plastics.\n2. Integrating the use of plastics with other materials to create new products and technologies.\n3. Using the understanding of plastic properties to develop new recycling methods and technologies.\n4. Combining the knowledge of plastic production with environmental concerns to develop more sustainable manufacturing practices.\n5. Integrating the use of plastics in various industries (e.g. packaging, medical, consumer products) to create new and innovative solutions.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the impact of plastics on the environment and justifying the need for sustainable alternatives.\n2. Critiquing the use of plastics in various products and industries, and identifying areas for improvement.\n3. Justifying the development of new plastics and manufacturing technologies in terms of their potential benefits and drawbacks.\n4. Evaluating the effectiveness of current recycling methods and technologies, and identifying areas for improvement.\n5. Justifying the need for policy changes or regulations to address the environmental problems created by plastic use."
