    "refinement_output": "Based on the provided transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) Which bonobo is known for learning to communicate with humans using a keyboard of abstract symbols in the 1980s?\n    - A: Koko\n    - B: Kanzi\n    - C: Fossey\n    - D: Washoe\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n2) Approximately how many distinct human languages are spoken worldwide?\n    - A: 5,000\n    - B: 7,000\n    - C: 10,000\n    - D: 15,000\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n3) What is the primary difference between language and communication?\n    - A: Language is a system for sharing simple ideas, while communication is a system for sharing complex ideas.\n    - B: Language is a system for sharing complex ideas and thoughts, while communication is a broader concept that includes language.\n    - C: Language is a system for conveying emotions, while communication is a system for conveying information.\n    - D: Language is a system for sharing gestures, while communication is a system for sharing vocalizations.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\n4) What characteristic of human language allows for an unlimited number of possible messages?\n    - A: Its limited vocabulary\n    - B: Its grammatical structure\n    - C: Its open-ended nature\n    - D: Its reliance on gestures\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n5) How can understanding the origins of language inform our understanding of human evolution and development?\n    - A: By providing insights into the emergence of complex thought and perception\n    - B: By shedding light on the development of bipedalism\n    - C: By revealing the secrets of animal communication\n    - D: By explaining the role of language in shaping human culture\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nRefined to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\n6) What is one potential benefit of recognizing the unique capacity for language in humans?\n    - A: It can help us better appreciate the complexities of animal communication.\n    - B: It can help us better appreciate the complexities of human communication.\n    - C: It can help us develop more effective language learning strategies.\n    - D: It can help us understand the role of language in shaping human identity.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nRefined to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\n7) What is the relationship between language and communication?\n    - A: All language is communication, and all communication is language.\n    - B: All language is communication, but not all communication is language.\n    - C: All communication is language, but not all language is communication.\n    - D: Language and communication are unrelated concepts.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n8) What is the primary difference between human language and animal communication?\n    - A: Human language is limited to specific messages, while animal communication is open-ended.\n    - B: Human language is open-ended, while animal communication is generally limited to specific messages.\n    - C: Human language is based on gestures, while animal communication is based on vocalizations.\n    - D: Human language is innate, while animal communication is learned.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n9) What may have contributed to the emergence of complex thought and perception in humans?\n    - A: The development of bipedalism\n    - B: The emergence of speech\n    - C: The development of language\n    - D: The evolution of the human brain\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\n10) How may the unique capacity for language in humans have influenced the development of our species?\n    - A: By allowing us to adapt to different environments\n    - B: By enabling us to communicate with other species\n    - C: By limiting our ability to express complex ideas\n    - D: By facilitating the development of complex thought and perception\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nNo refinement needed.\n\n11) What is one potential limitation of the definition of language?\n    - A: It is too broad and encompasses animal communication.\n    - B: It is too narrow and excludes certain forms of human communication.\n    - C: It may not be applicable to animal communication.\n    - D: It neglects the role of culture in shaping language.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\n12) What is one potential critique of the methods used to measure language in humans and animals?\n    - A: They are too subjective and rely on human interpretation.\n    - B: They are too objective and neglect the complexities of language.\n    - C: They may not be comparable across species.\n    - D: They neglect the role of context in shaping language use.\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nRefined to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\nAdditional refinement suggestions:\n\n- Consider adding more questions that address the relationship between language and thought, as well as the role of language in shaping human culture and identity.\n- Consider adding more questions that address the limitations and potential biases of the definition of language and the methods used to measure language in humans and animals.\n- Consider refining the distractors to make them more plausible and challenging, while ensuring that the correct answers remain accurate and clear."
