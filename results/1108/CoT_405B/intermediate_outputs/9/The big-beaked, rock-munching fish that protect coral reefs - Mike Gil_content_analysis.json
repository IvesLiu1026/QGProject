    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Parrotfish eat rocks and seaweed.\n2. Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the ocean floor but are home to over 25% of marine life.\n3. Coral polyps generate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate.\n4. Seaweed can become problematic and lethal to corals in high densities.\n5. Parrotfish can remove even the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor.\n6. Parrotfish have a mosaic of tightly-packed teeth that can scrape and grind rock.\n7. Human activities have disrupted almost every part of the coral reef ecosystem.\n8. Overfishing has reduced the number of parrotfish and other seaweed-eating fish.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. Coral reefs are complex ecosystems that rely on the interactions of various species, including parrotfish, coral, and seaweed.\n2. Parrotfish play a key role in defending the coral reef ecosystem by controlling seaweed growth.\n3. Coral reefs provide important benefits to both marine and human life, including ecotourism, sustainable fishing, and scientific research.\n4. The social networks of parrotfish and other coral-dwelling fish can convey information and inform behavior.\n5. Human activities, such as overfishing and pollution, have contributed to the decline of coral reefs.\n\n**Application (Real-World Scenarios)**\n\n1. How can the knowledge of parrotfish behavior be used to develop strategies for preserving coral reefs?\n2. What are the potential consequences of overfishing and pollution on coral reef ecosystems?\n3. How can ecotourism and sustainable fishing practices be used to support the conservation of coral reefs?\n4. What role can scientific research play in understanding and addressing the decline of coral reefs?\n\n**Analysis (Relationships and Contrasts)**\n\n1. How do the interactions between parrotfish, coral, and seaweed affect the balance of the coral reef ecosystem?\n2. What are the relationships between human activities, such as overfishing and pollution, and the decline of coral reefs?\n3. How do the social networks of parrotfish and other coral-dwelling fish contribute to the functioning of the ecosystem?\n4. What are the contrasts between the benefits of coral reefs to marine and human life and the threats they face?\n\n**Synthesis (Combining Ideas)**\n\n1. How can the understanding of parrotfish behavior and the social networks of coral-dwelling fish be combined to develop new strategies for preserving coral reefs?\n2. What are the potential consequences of combining human activities, such as overfishing and pollution, on coral reef ecosystems?\n3. How can the knowledge of coral reef ecosystems be used to develop new approaches to ecotourism and sustainable fishing practices?\n4. What are the potential benefits of combining scientific research and conservation efforts to protect coral reefs?\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment and Justification)**\n\n1. What are the ethical implications of overfishing and pollution on coral reef ecosystems?\n2. How can the benefits of coral reefs to marine and human life be weighed against the costs of conservation efforts?\n3. What are the potential consequences of not taking action to protect coral reefs?\n4. How can the effectiveness of conservation efforts be evaluated and justified?"
