Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the names of the last two known northern white rhinos?\n    - A: Nájin and Sudan\n    - B: Fatu and Sudan\n    - C: Nájin and Fatu\n    - D: Sudan and Nájin\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Approximately how many years ago did poachers begin hunting rhinos for their horns, contributing to the decline of the northern white rhino population?\n    - A: 20 years ago\n    - B: 30 years ago\n    - C: 40 years ago\n    - D: 50 years ago\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n3) What are the primary reasons for the northern white rhino species being at risk of extinction?\n    - A: Habitat loss and climate change\n    - B: Poaching and civil wars\n    - C: Human-wildlife conflict and disease\n    - D: Lack of food and water\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the ultimate goal of conservation efforts for the northern white rhino?\n    - A: To establish a breeding population in captivity\n    - B: To release the remaining rhinos into the wild\n    - C: To establish a breeding population in their original range\n    - D: To use them for research purposes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What technique is being used to revive the northern white rhino species?\n    - A: Cloning\n    - B: Artificial reproduction using stored semen and surrogate mothers\n    - C: In vitro fertilization\n    - D: Stem cell therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) Why is the southern white rhino being used as a surrogate mother for the northern white rhino?\n    - A: Because it is a different species\n    - B: Because it is a closely related species with similar reproductive characteristics\n    - C: Because it is a larger species\n    - D: Because it is a smaller species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the lack of a male northern white rhino and the species' functional extinction?\n    - A: The lack of a male has no effect on the species' extinction\n    - B: The lack of a male means the species cannot reproduce naturally\n    - C: The lack of a male means the species is more vulnerable to disease\n    - D: The lack of a male means the species is more vulnerable to predators\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the relationship between human actions and the decline of the northern white rhino population?\n    - A: Human actions have no impact on the decline of the species\n    - B: Human actions, such as poaching and civil wars, have contributed to the decline of the species\n    - C: Human actions, such as conservation efforts, have helped to increase the population\n    - D: Human actions, such as research, have had no impact on the species\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the potential benefit of combining artificial reproduction techniques with conservation efforts for the northern white rhino?\n    - A: It could lead to the extinction of the species\n    - B: It could lead to the creation of a new species\n    - C: It could lead to the revival of the species\n    - D: It could lead to the decline of the species\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How could the techniques used to revive the northern white rhino be applied to other endangered species?\n    - A: By using the same surrogate mother species\n    - B: By using the same artificial reproduction techniques\n    - C: By using the same conservation efforts\n    - D: By using a combination of techniques tailored to each species\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n11) What is a justification for expending effort and resources on saving animals threatened with extinction?\n    - A: Because it is a moral obligation to protect all species\n    - B: Because it is a financial burden on society\n    - C: Because it is a way to promote biodiversity and ecosystem health\n    - D: Because it is a way to promote human well-being\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) What is an ethical consideration involved in using artificial reproduction techniques to revive a species?\n    - A: The potential for animal suffering\n    - B: The potential for environmental harm\n    - C: The potential for human benefit\n    - D: The potential for financial gain\n[Correct answer]: A\n\nNo more refinement needed."
