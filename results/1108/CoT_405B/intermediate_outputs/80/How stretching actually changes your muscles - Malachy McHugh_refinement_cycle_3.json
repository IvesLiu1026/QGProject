    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two main types of stretching that can help prepare an athlete for physical activity?\n    - A: Isometric and isotonic\n    - B: Dynamic and static\n    - C: Active and passive\n    - D: Flexibility and mobility\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the smallest contracting unit of muscle tissue that plays a crucial role in muscle stretching?\n    - A: Muscle fiber\n    - B: Sarcomere\n    - C: Tendon\n    - D: Ligament\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a potential benefit of regular stretching for athletes and individuals with active lifestyles?\n    - A: Increased muscle mass\n    - B: Improved cardiovascular endurance\n    - C: Reduced risk of muscle injuries\n    - D: Enhanced bone density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How long do the benefits of stretching typically last without further activity or exercise?\n    - A: 30 minutes\n    - B: 1 hour\n    - C: 10 minutes\n    - D: 2 hours\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) What type of stretch would be most effective for an athlete looking to improve their flexibility before a game?\n    - A: Dynamic stretch\n    - B: Static stretch\n    - C: Isometric stretch\n    - D: Ballistic stretch\n[Correct answer]: B (Note: I replaced isotonic stretch with ballistic stretch, which is a more plausible distractor.)\n\n6) What approach would be most effective for a person with a desk job looking to improve their flexibility?\n    - A: Creating a comprehensive stretching regimen\n    - B: Joining a recreational sports team\n    - C: Incorporating more physical activity into daily routines\n    - D: Focusing solely on dynamic stretches\n[Correct answer]: A (Note: I revised the distractors to make them more plausible and relevant to the context.)\n\n7) How do muscles respond to stretching in terms of their structure and composition?\n    - A: Muscles are rigid and unresponsive to stretching\n    - B: Muscles are viscoelastic and respond to stretching by changing elastic proteins and sarcomeres\n    - C: Muscles are only affected by dynamic stretches\n    - D: Muscles are only affected by static stretches\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main difference between dynamic and static stretches in terms of their effect on muscles?\n    - A: Dynamic stretches are faster, while static stretches are slower\n    - B: Dynamic stretches engage a range of muscles, while static stretches focus on specific muscles\n    - C: Dynamic stretches improve flexibility, while static stretches improve strength\n    - D: Dynamic stretches are less effective, while static stretches are more effective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of combining stretching with exercise or physical activity?\n    - A: Improved cardiovascular endurance\n    - B: Increased muscle mass\n    - C: Improved flexibility and reduced injury risk\n    - D: Enhanced bone density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a key consideration when designing a stretching program to improve flexibility?\n    - A: Ignoring the limitations of stretching\n    - B: Focusing solely on dynamic stretches\n    - C: Considering the limitations of stretching, such as its temporary benefits and potential risks\n    - D: Incorporating only static stretches\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is an important factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of a stretching regimen?\n    - A: The number of stretches performed\n    - B: The duration of each stretch\n    - C: The reduction in muscle injuries\n    - D: The increase in muscle mass\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is frequent stretching important for improving flexibility and reducing muscle injury risk?\n    - A: Because it increases muscle mass\n    - B: Because it enhances bone density\n    - C: Because it leads to lasting changes in the brain and improved flexibility\n    - D: Because it reduces cardiovascular endurance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n13) According to current research, how often and for how long should an individual stretch to improve their flexibility?\n    - A: 5 minutes a day for 1 month\n    - B: 10 minutes a day for 2 months\n    - C: 15 minutes a day for 3 months\n    - D: 30 minutes a day for 6 months\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n14) What is a potential risk of excessive flexibility?\n    - A: Reduced risk of muscle injuries\n    - B: Improved cardiovascular endurance\n    - C: Increased risk of joint injuries\n    - D: Enhanced bone density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo more refinement needed."
