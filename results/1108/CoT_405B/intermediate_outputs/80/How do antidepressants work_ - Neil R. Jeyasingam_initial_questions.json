What is the expected outcome of this treatment?\n    - A: The patient's serotonin levels will decrease\n    - B: The patient's serotonin levels will increase\n    - C: The patient's depression will worsen\n    - D: The patient's depression will have no significant change\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) A clinician is considering treating a patient with depression using a combination of medication and therapy. What is the rationale behind this approach?\n    - A: The chemical imbalance theory is a complete explanation for depression\n    - B: The chemical imbalance theory is an incomplete explanation for depression\n    - C: Medication alone is the most effective treatment for depression\n    - D: Therapy alone is the most effective treatment for depression\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect connections)**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the discovery of ipronaizid and imipramine and the development of the chemical imbalance theory?\n    - A: The discovery of ipronaizid and imipramine led to the rejection of the chemical imbalance theory\n    - B: The discovery of ipronaizid and imipramine led to the development of the chemical imbalance theory\n    - C: The discovery of ipronaizid and imipramine had no significant impact on the chemical imbalance theory\n    - D: The chemical imbalance theory led to the discovery of ipronaizid and imipramine\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the limitation of the example of steroid creams treating rashes caused by poison ivy in understanding the relationship between treatment and underlying condition?\n    - A: It illustrates a causal relationship between the treatment and the underlying condition\n    - B: It illustrates the effectiveness of the treatment in curing the underlying condition\n    - C: It highlights the complexity of the relationship between treatment and underlying condition\n    - D: It has no significant relevance to understanding the relationship between treatment and underlying condition\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas to form new understanding)**\n\n1) What is the result of combining the understanding of the role of serotonin in depression and the development of SSRIs?\n    - A: A more comprehensive understanding of depression, including the role of other neurotransmitters\n    - B: A more limited understanding of depression, focusing only on serotonin\n    - C: A rejection of the chemical imbalance theory\n    - D: No significant change in the understanding of depression\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) How can the example of steroid creams and poison ivy be applied to the understanding of antidepressant drugs and depression?\n    - A: It highlights the simplicity of the relationship between treatment and underlying condition\n    - B: It highlights the complexity of the relationship between treatment and underlying condition\n    - C: It illustrates a causal relationship between the treatment and the underlying condition\n    - D: It has no significant relevance to understanding the relationship between treatment and underlying condition\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1) What is the limitation of the shift towards treating depression with medication alone?\n    - A: It is the most effective treatment for depression\n    - B: It is a more cost-effective treatment for depression\n    - C: It neglects the complexity of depression and the need for combination therapy\n    - D: It has no significant limitations\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) What is the justification for critically evaluating the relationship between treatment and underlying condition in the context of antidepressant drugs and depression?\n    - A: The effectiveness of a treatment necessarily implies a causal relationship between the treatment and the underlying condition\n    - B: The relationship between treatment and underlying condition is always simple and straightforward\n    - C: The example of steroid creams and poison ivy highlights the importance of critically evaluating this relationship\n    - D: There is no need to critically evaluate this relationship\n[Correct answer]: C"
