Choking is a phenomenon where a person fails to perform under pressure despite months or years of practice.\n2. Performance anxiety affects not only athletes but also public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and musicians.\n3. There are two sets of theories explaining choking: distraction theories and explicit monitoring theories.\n4. Working memory is a mental \"scratch pad\" that temporarily stores information.\n5. Research studies have shown that people who are self-conscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged negatively are more susceptible to choking.\n6. Practicing under stressful conditions, having a pre-performance routine, and focusing on the ultimate goal can help avoid choking.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Choking occurs when the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing on the task at hand.\n2. The brain can only process so much information at once, making tasks that challenge working memory vulnerable to pressure.\n3. Explicit monitoring theories suggest that overanalyzing a task can interfere with one's ability to perform it.\n4. Tasks that are typically done unconsciously are most vulnerable to choking.\n5. Having an external focus on the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus on the mechanics of the task.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Athletes can practice under stressful conditions to improve their performance under pressure.\n2. Public speakers can use pre-performance routines, such as taking deep breaths or repeating a cue word, to reduce anxiety and improve their performance.\n3. Musicians can focus on the ultimate goal of their performance, such as the audience's appreciation, rather than the mechanics of playing their instrument.\n4. Students can use techniques such as visualization or positive self-talk to reduce anxiety and improve their performance on exams.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between pressure and performance is complex, and there are multiple factors that contribute to choking.\n2. The two sets of theories (distraction and explicit monitoring) provide different explanations for why choking occurs.\n3. Research studies have shown that certain personality traits, such as self-consciousness and anxiety, can increase a person's susceptibility to choking.\n4. The effectiveness of different strategies for avoiding choking, such as practicing under stressful conditions and having a pre-performance routine, can be compared and contrasted.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. Combining the concepts of distraction theories and explicit monitoring theories can provide a more comprehensive understanding of choking.\n2. Integrating research findings on personality traits and choking can help identify individuals who are most at risk and develop targeted interventions.\n3. Developing new strategies for avoiding choking, such as combining practice under stressful conditions with pre-performance routines, can be explored.\n4. Considering the role of working memory in choking can lead to the development of new techniques for improving performance under pressure.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies for avoiding choking, such as practicing under stressful conditions and having a pre-performance routine.\n2. Assessing the validity of the two sets of theories (distraction and explicit monitoring) in explaining choking.\n3. Judging the relative importance of different factors that contribute to choking, such as pressure, anxiety, and working memory.\n4. Critiquing the methodology of research studies on choking and suggesting improvements for future studies."
