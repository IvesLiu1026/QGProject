    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the term used to describe the phenomenon where an individual fails to perform under pressure despite extensive practice?\n    - A: Performance anxiety\n    - B: Choking\n    - C: Distraction\n    - D: Overanalysis\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) According to research studies, which type of individuals are more prone to choking under pressure?\n    - A: Confident and experienced\n    - B: Self-conscious and anxious\n    - C: Skilled and outgoing\n    - D: Unprepared and novice\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What happens to the mind when a person chokes under pressure, according to distraction theories?\n    - A: It becomes more focused on the task\n    - B: It is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears\n    - C: It becomes more confident and calm\n    - D: It is not affected by pressure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to explicit monitoring theories, what can interfere with a person's ability to perform a task?\n    - A: Lack of practice\n    - B: Overanalyzing the task\n    - C: Insufficient knowledge\n    - D: External distractions\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How can athletes improve their performance under pressure?\n    - A: By avoiding practice under stressful conditions\n    - B: By focusing on the mechanics of the task\n    - C: By practicing under stressful conditions\n    - D: By ignoring the ultimate goal\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What can public speakers use to reduce anxiety and improve their performance?\n    - A: Pre-performance routines, such as taking deep breaths or repeating a cue word\n    - B: Visualization techniques to distract themselves from the audience\n    - C: A script to read from instead of speaking from memory\n    - D: A loud and assertive tone to dominate the audience\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) What is the relationship between pressure and performance, according to research studies?\n    - A: Simple and straightforward\n    - B: Complex and influenced by multiple factors\n    - C: Inverse and directly proportional\n    - D: Unrelated and independent\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What do the two sets of theories (distraction and explicit monitoring) provide for understanding choking?\n    - A: Identical explanations\n    - B: Different explanations\n    - C: Complementary explanations\n    - D: No explanations\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What can be gained by combining the concepts of distraction theories and explicit monitoring theories?\n    - A: A more narrow understanding of choking\n    - B: A more comprehensive understanding of choking\n    - C: A complete rejection of both theories\n    - D: A new and unrelated theory\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What can be explored by considering the role of working memory in choking?\n    - A: New techniques for improving performance under pressure\n    - B: The importance of ignoring working memory\n    - C: The irrelevance of working memory to choking\n    - D: The need to reject both distraction and explicit monitoring theories\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What should be done to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for avoiding choking?\n    - A: Compare and contrast the strategies\n    - B: Reject all strategies as ineffective\n    - C: Accept all strategies as effective\n    - D: Ignore the need for evaluation\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What should be done to assess the validity of the two sets of theories (distraction and explicit monitoring)?\n    - A: Accept both theories as valid without question\n    - B: Reject both theories as invalid without question\n    - C: Critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both theories\n    - D: Ignore the need for assessment\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI've made minor adjustments to the questions to enhance clarity and concision, and confirmed that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. The correct answers remain accurate. No more refinement is needed for questions 1-12."
