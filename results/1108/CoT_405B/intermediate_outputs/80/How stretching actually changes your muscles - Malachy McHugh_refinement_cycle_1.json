    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I've reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two main types of stretching an athlete might do to prepare for physical activity?\n    - A: Isometric and isotonic\n    - B: Dynamic and static\n    - C: Active and passive\n    - D: Flexibility and mobility\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the smallest contracting unit of muscle tissue that plays a crucial role in muscle stretching?\n    - A: Muscle fiber\n    - B: Sarcomere\n    - C: Tendon\n    - D: Ligament\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is a potential benefit of regular stretching for athletes and individuals with active lifestyles?\n    - A: Increased muscle mass\n    - B: Improved cardiovascular endurance\n    - C: Reduced risk of muscle injuries\n    - D: Enhanced bone density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) How long do the benefits of stretching typically last without further activity or exercise?\n    - A: 30 minutes\n    - B: 1 hour\n    - C: 10 minutes\n    - D: 2 hours\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) An athlete wants to improve their flexibility before a game. What type of stretch would be most effective in this situation?\n    - A: Dynamic stretch\n    - B: Static stretch\n    - C: Isometric stretch\n    - D: Isotonic stretch\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) A person with a desk job wants to improve their flexibility. What would be a good approach to achieve this goal?\n    - A: Creating a comprehensive stretching regimen\n    - B: Joining a sports team\n    - C: Buying a gym membership\n    - D: Hiring a personal trainer\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n7) How do muscles respond to stretching in terms of their structure and composition?\n    - A: Muscles are rigid and unresponsive to stretching\n    - B: Muscles are viscoelastic and respond to stretching by changing elastic proteins and sarcomeres\n    - C: Muscles are only affected by dynamic stretches\n    - D: Muscles are only affected by static stretches\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the main difference between dynamic and static stretches in terms of their effect on muscles?\n    - A: Dynamic stretches are faster, while static stretches are slower\n    - B: Dynamic stretches engage a range of muscles, while static stretches focus on specific muscles\n    - C: Dynamic stretches are more effective, while static stretches are less effective\n    - D: Dynamic stretches are less effective, while static stretches are more effective\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a potential benefit of combining stretching with exercise or physical activity?\n    - A: Improved cardiovascular endurance\n    - B: Increased muscle mass\n    - C: Improved flexibility and reduced injury risk\n    - D: Enhanced bone density\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a key consideration when designing a stretching program to improve flexibility?\n    - A: Only including dynamic stretches\n    - B: Only including static stretches\n    - C: Considering the limitations of stretching, such as its temporary benefits and potential risks\n    - D: Ignoring the limitations of stretching\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is an important factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of a stretching regimen?\n    - A: The number of stretches performed\n    - B: The duration of each stretch\n    - C: The reduction in muscle injuries\n    - D: The increase in muscle mass\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is frequent stretching important for improving flexibility and reducing muscle injury risk?\n    - A: Because it increases muscle mass\n    - B: Because it enhances bone density\n    - C: Because it leads to lasting changes in the brain and improved flexibility\n    - D: Because it reduces cardiovascular endurance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nNo significant changes were made to the questions, but some minor refinements were made to improve clarity and concision."
