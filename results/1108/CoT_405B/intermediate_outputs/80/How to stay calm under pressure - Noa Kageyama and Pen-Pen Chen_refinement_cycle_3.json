    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What phenomenon occurs when a person fails to perform under pressure despite extensive practice?\n    - A: Performance anxiety\n    - B: Choking\n    - C: Distraction theory\n    - D: Stage fright\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What are the two sets of theories that explain why people choke under pressure?\n    - A: Distraction theories and performance anxiety theories\n    - B: Explicit monitoring theories and working memory theories\n    - C: Distraction theories and explicit monitoring theories\n    - D: Motivation theories and self-efficacy theories\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What is working memory, and how does it relate to choking under pressure?\n    - A: It is the mental process used to analyze information, and it is not affected by pressure.\n    - B: It is the mental \"scratch pad\" used to temporarily store information, and it is vulnerable to pressure.\n    - C: It is the mental state used to focus on a task, and it is enhanced by pressure.\n    - D: It is the mental capacity used to store long-term memories, and it is not affected by pressure.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to research, what can help individuals become accustomed to pressure and reduce the likelihood of choking?\n    - A: Practicing under relaxed conditions\n    - B: Focusing on the mechanics of the task\n    - C: Practicing under stressful conditions\n    - D: Ignoring the pressure\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) A musician is about to perform on stage and is feeling anxious. What strategy can they use to help manage their performance anxiety?\n    - A: Take a few minutes to analyze their music sheet\n    - B: Take deep breaths and repeat a cue word\n    - C: Focus on the mechanics of playing their instrument\n    - D: Try to distract themselves by thinking about something else\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What type of pre-performance routine can help a musician manage their performance anxiety?\n    - A: Analyzing their music sheet\n    - B: Engaging in a short, consistent ritual such as taking deep breaths or repeating a cue word\n    - C: Focusing on the mechanics of playing their instrument\n    - D: Visualizing themselves failing\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) An athlete is preparing for a high-pressure competition. What strategy can they use to prepare for the pressure?\n    - A: Practice under relaxed conditions\n    - B: Focus on the mechanics of their sport\n    - C: Practice under stressful conditions\n    - D: Visualize themselves winning\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the relationship between pressure and performance, according to research?\n    - A: Pressure always leads to better performance\n    - B: Pressure always leads to worse performance\n    - C: The relationship between pressure and performance is complex and depends on the individual\n    - D: Pressure has no effect on performance\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) What do the two sets of theories explaining choking (distraction and explicit monitoring) suggest about the factors that contribute to performance anxiety?\n    - A: They suggest that only distraction contributes to performance anxiety\n    - B: They suggest that only explicit monitoring contributes to performance anxiety\n    - C: They suggest that both distraction and explicit monitoring contribute to performance anxiety\n    - D: They suggest that neither distraction nor explicit monitoring contributes to performance anxiety\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) How can the concepts of distraction theories and explicit monitoring theories be combined to develop a more comprehensive understanding of choking?\n    - A: By recognizing that distraction and explicit monitoring are mutually exclusive\n    - B: By recognizing that distraction and explicit monitoring are both contributing factors to choking\n    - C: By ignoring the role of distraction and focusing on explicit monitoring\n    - D: By ignoring the role of explicit monitoring and focusing on distraction\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What strategy can be developed by combining the concepts of practicing under stressful conditions and external focus?\n    - A: A training program that focuses on the mechanics of the task\n    - B: A training program that helps individuals prepare for high-pressure situations by practicing under stressful conditions and focusing on the ultimate goal\n    - C: A training program that ignores the role of pressure and focuses on relaxation techniques\n    - D: A training program that focuses on building self-confidence\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is the most effective way to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for managing performance anxiety?\n    - A: By relying on anecdotal evidence\n    - B: By conducting systematic research studies\n    - C: By asking experts for their opinions\n    - D: By ignoring the need for evaluation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n13) What is a limitation of the two sets of theories explaining choking, and what area of research is needed to address this limitation?\n    - A: The theories are too broad and need to be more specific\n    - B: The theories are too narrow and need to be more comprehensive\n    - C: The theories ignore the role of individual differences and need to be more tailored to specific individuals\n    - D: The theories are too complex and need to be simplified\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n14) According to research, what type of focus is more effective for individuals performing under pressure?\n    - A: Internal focus on the mechanics of the task\n    - B: External focus on the ultimate goal\n    - C: Focus on the audience's expectations\n    - D: Focus on the potential consequences of failure\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed."
