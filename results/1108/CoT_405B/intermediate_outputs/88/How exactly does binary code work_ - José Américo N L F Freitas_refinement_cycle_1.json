    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What are the two digits used in binary code?\n    - A: 0 and 2\n    - B: 0 and 1\n    - C: 1 and 2\n    - D: 2 and 3\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What technique is used to store sound in binary code?\n    - A: Run-length encoding\n    - B: Pulse code modulation\n    - C: Decimal notation\n    - D: Binary notation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What determines the meaning of a binary sequence?\n    - A: The length of the sequence\n    - B: The context in which it is used\n    - C: The type of data being represented\n    - D: The device processing the data\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary advantage of using binary code for data representation?\n    - A: It is easy to learn and understand\n    - B: It allows for efficient storage and transmission of data\n    - C: It is only used for numbers and letters\n    - D: It is not used in computer programming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) How is binary code used in real-world applications such as watching movies?\n    - A: It is used to control the movie player device\n    - B: It is used to process data according to software instructions\n    - C: It is used to represent the movie data, such as images and sound\n    - D: It is not used in movie applications\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n6) What is the purpose of using compression formats, such as run-length encoding, in binary code?\n    - A: To increase the amount of data required to represent an image\n    - B: To reduce the amount of data required to represent an image\n    - C: To change the format of the data from binary to decimal\n    - D: To encrypt the data for security purposes\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between binary code and the devices that use it, such as transistors and processors?\n    - A: The devices control the binary code\n    - B: The binary code controls the devices\n    - C: The devices and binary code are independent of each other\n    - D: The devices and binary code are only used for numbers and letters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does binary code compare to other forms of data representation, such as decimal notation?\n    - A: Binary code is more complex and less efficient\n    - B: Binary code is simpler and more efficient\n    - C: Binary code is only used for numbers, while decimal notation is used for letters\n    - D: Binary code is not used in computer programming, while decimal notation is\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the potential benefit of combining binary code with compression formats, such as run-length encoding?\n    - A: It would increase the amount of data required to represent an image\n    - B: It would reduce the amount of data required to represent an image\n    - C: It would change the format of the data from binary to decimal\n    - D: It would not have any impact on the data representation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) What is the potential outcome of integrating binary code with other technologies, such as video drivers and audio software?\n    - A: It would create a less efficient and less effective system\n    - B: It would create a more efficient and more effective system\n    - C: It would not have any impact on the system\n    - D: It would only be used for numbers and letters\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential advantage of using binary code as a form of data representation?\n    - A: It is complex and difficult to learn\n    - B: It is simple and efficient\n    - C: It is only used for numbers and letters\n    - D: It is not used in computer programming\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) What is a potential limitation of using binary code in various applications, such as data storage and transmission?\n    - A: It is too efficient and takes up too little space\n    - B: It is too complex and difficult to learn\n    - C: It can be limited in its ability to represent complex data, such as images and sound, without compression\n    - D: It is not used in computer programming\n[Correct answer]: C\n\nI made minor adjustments to questions 3, 6, 9, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. I also rephrased question 12 to make it more accurate and specific. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
