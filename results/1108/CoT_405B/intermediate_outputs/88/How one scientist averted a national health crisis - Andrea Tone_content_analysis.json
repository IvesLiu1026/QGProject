    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Frances Oldham Kelsey joined the FDA in 1960.\n2. Kelsey graduated from McGill University in Montreal with undergraduate and master's degrees in pharmacology.\n3. She earned her doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Chicago.\n4. Kelsey earned an MD in 1950.\n5. Thalidomide was developed in Germany as a sedative.\n6. Thalidomide was widely used in dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress.\n7. The FDA classifies drugs based on their safety for a fetus.\n8. Kelsey's research demonstrated that drugs could pass from mother to fetus through the placenta.\n9. Merrell's application for thalidomide was rejected by Kelsey due to inadequate data.\n10. Thalidomide caused severe birth defects, including nerve damage, extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. Frances Kelsey's educational background and experience made her a highly qualified scientist at the FDA.\n2. The concept of the placental barrier shielding a fetus from harm was a common belief among experts in 1960.\n3. Kelsey's research on fetal safety and her experience with animal-based studies influenced her decision to reject Merrell's application.\n4. Merrell's attempts to convince Kelsey to approve thalidomide were unsuccessful, and the company eventually withdrew their application.\n5. The thalidomide tragedy led to changes in FDA regulations and the way new drugs are approved.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. The importance of rigorous testing and evidence-based medicine in the approval of new drugs.\n2. The role of regulatory agencies like the FDA in protecting public health.\n3. The impact of individual scientists like Frances Kelsey on shaping public policy and regulations.\n4. The need for pharmaceutical companies to prioritize patient safety over profits.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. The relationship between Kelsey's research on fetal safety and her decision to reject Merrell's application.\n2. The contrast between the FDA's initial expectations of an easy review and the actual outcome.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between thalidomide's use and the resulting birth defects.\n4. The impact of Kelsey's actions on the FDA's regulations and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. The combination of Kelsey's educational background, research experience, and FDA role created a perfect storm for her to make a significant impact on public health.\n2. The intersection of science, policy, and public awareness in shaping the response to the thalidomide tragedy.\n3. The ways in which individual actions can inspire systemic change and reforms.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Evaluating the ethics of Merrell's actions in attempting to convince Kelsey to approve thalidomide despite inadequate data.\n2. Justifying the FDA's decision to reject Merrell's application and the subsequent changes to regulations.\n3. Critiquing the pharmaceutical industry's priorities and practices in the 1960s.\n4. Assessing the impact of Kelsey's legacy on the FDA and public health today."
