The city consists of 16 blocks formed by 5 streets running west to east and 5 streets running north to south.\n3. The temple's entrance is at the southeast corner.\n4. The city imposes a unique tax on visitors, which increases by 2 silver for every block walked east and doubles for every block walked south.\n5. The tax is halved for every block walked north and subtracts 2 silver for every block walked west.\n6. The pilgrim starts with a debt of 4 silver.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. The tax system in Duonia is based on the direction of movement, with east and south movements increasing the tax and north and west movements decreasing it.\n2. The pilgrim's goal is to reach the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice in any direction.\n3. The pilgrim can use clockwise and counterclockwise loops to manipulate their tax debt.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. The pilgrim can apply the tax rules to plan their route to the temple.\n2. The pilgrim can use the concept of clockwise and counterclockwise loops to reduce their tax debt.\n3. The pilgrim can use the city map to plan their route and avoid walking the same block twice.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. The relationship between the tax rules and the direction of movement is crucial to understanding the problem.\n2. The order in which the tax rules are applied makes a significant difference in the outcome.\n3. The pilgrim must analyze the consequences of each possible route to choose the best option.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1. The pilgrim combines the concepts of clockwise and counterclockwise loops with the tax rules to create a new understanding of how to manipulate their tax debt.\n2. The pilgrim synthesizes the information from the city map and the tax rules to plan a route that meets the conditions of the problem.\n3. The pilgrim's solution involves thinking creatively about how to use the tax rules to their advantage.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. The pilgrim must evaluate the effectiveness of different routes in reducing their tax debt.\n2. The pilgrim must justify their decision to take a particular route based on the tax rules and the city map.\n3. The pilgrim's solution can be evaluated based on its efficiency and effectiveness in meeting the conditions of the problem.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for creating assessment questions that target different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy."
