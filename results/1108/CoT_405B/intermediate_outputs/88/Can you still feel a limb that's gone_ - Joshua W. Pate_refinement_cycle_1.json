    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the name of the model that represents the human body with proportions based on the size of each body part's representation in the cortex?\n    - A: Cortical Homunculus Model\n    - B: Somatosensory Cortex Model\n    - C: Phantom Limb Model\n    - D: Neural Pathway Model\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n2) Which type of therapy uses a reflective illusion to help reduce phantom pain by creating a visual representation of the missing limb?\n    - A: Virtual Reality Therapy\n    - B: Mirror Box Therapy\n    - C: Prosthetic Therapy\n    - D: Cortical Stimulation Therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What is the primary function of the somatosensory cortex in relation to phantom limbs?\n    - A: To process motor signals from the brain to the limbs\n    - B: To process sensory signals from the body to the brain\n    - C: To regulate the neural pathways after an amputation\n    - D: To control the growth and shrinkage of cortical representation\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What happens to the cortical representation of a body part when it receives increased sensory input?\n    - A: It remains unchanged\n    - B: It grows\n    - C: It shrinks\n    - D: It becomes inactive\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) A patient with phantom pain is considering treatment options. Which of the following therapies is most likely to be effective in reducing phantom pain?\n    - A: Physical Therapy\n    - B: Mirror Box Therapy\n    - C: Occupational Therapy\n    - D: Speech Therapy\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What feature should a prosthetic limb have to help alleviate phantom pain?\n    - A: Enhanced motor control\n    - B: Increased sensory feedback\n    - C: Improved durability\n    - D: Reduced weight\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What is the relationship between the brain's map of the body and phantom limb sensations?\n    - A: The brain's map of the body is not related to phantom limb sensations\n    - B: The brain's map of the body is responsible for phantom limb sensations\n    - C: Phantom limb sensations are caused by a lack of sensory input to the brain's map of the body\n    - D: The brain's map of the body is only responsible for motor control, not sensory perception\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is the effect of the loss of inhibitory control in the dorsal horn on distress signals?\n    - A: The loss of inhibitory control in the dorsal horn reduces the intensification of distress signals\n    - B: The loss of inhibitory control in the dorsal horn has no effect on the intensification of distress signals\n    - C: The loss of inhibitory control in the dorsal horn causes the intensification of distress signals\n    - D: The intensification of distress signals causes the loss of inhibitory control in the dorsal horn\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n9) How can changes in cortical representation affect the brain's map of the body, leading to phantom pain?\n    - A: By reducing the brain's ability to process sensory information\n    - B: By increasing the brain's ability to process motor signals\n    - C: By altering the way the brain interprets sensory input from the body\n    - D: By eliminating the brain's ability to perceive the body\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What is a potential treatment approach that combines mirror box therapy and prosthetics to alleviate phantom pain?\n    - A: Using mirror box therapy to enhance motor control in prosthetic limbs\n    - B: Designing prosthetic limbs that provide sensory feedback to the brain, combined with mirror box therapy\n    - C: Implementing mirror box therapy as a replacement for prosthetic limbs\n    - D: Using prosthetic limbs to enhance the effectiveness of mirror box therapy in reducing phantom pain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is a potential limitation of mirror box therapy in treating phantom pain?\n    - A: It is too expensive\n    - B: It is not widely available\n    - C: It may not be effective for all patients, particularly those with complex or chronic phantom pain\n    - D: It is too time-consuming\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n12) Why is research into phantom limbs important for the field of prosthetics?\n    - A: It can lead to the development of more advanced prosthetic limbs with enhanced motor control\n    - B: It can provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying phantom pain, leading to more effective treatments\n    - C: It can improve the durability and comfort of prosthetic limbs\n    - D: It can reduce the cost of prosthetic limbs\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-12. However, I suggest considering the addition of more questions to cover other key concepts in the transcript, such as the role of the spinal cord in phantom pain, the relationship between phantom pain and cortical representation, and the potential applications of research into phantom limbs beyond prosthetics."
