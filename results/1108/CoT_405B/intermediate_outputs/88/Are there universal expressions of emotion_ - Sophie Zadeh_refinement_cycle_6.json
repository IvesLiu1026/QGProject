    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) According to Charles Darwin, what human feature is thought to be common across cultures?\n    - A: Language\n    - B: Emotional expression\n    - C: Cognitive abilities\n    - D: Social norms\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) Which researcher tested the theory of universal emotional expressions by examining film footage of remote tribes isolated from the modern world?\n    - A: Silvan Tomkins\n    - B: Paul Ekman\n    - C: Charles Darwin\n    - D: Sigmund Freud\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What was the finding of researchers who studied facial expressions in people born blind?\n    - A: Their expressions were different from those of sighted people.\n    - B: Their expressions were the same as those of sighted people.\n    - C: They did not display any facial expressions.\n    - D: Their expressions were more intense than those of sighted people.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) According to Paul Ekman, what are the six core expressions that are universally recognized?\n    - A: Anger, disgust, fear, surprise, sadness, and contempt\n    - B: Anger, disgust, fear, surprise, sadness, and happiness\n    - C: Anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness, and shame\n    - D: Disgust, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness, and disapproval\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why are certain expressions, such as fear and surprise, thought to be universal?\n    - A: They are learned behaviors that vary across cultures.\n    - B: They signal immediate danger and are important for survival.\n    - C: They are linked to our physiology and improve group fitness.\n    - D: They are a result of cultural influence and social norms.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) (New question) What is the main idea behind the theory of universal emotional expressions?\n    - A: Emotional expressions are learned behaviors that vary across cultures.\n    - B: Emotional expressions are universal and recognized across cultures.\n    - C: Emotional expressions are linked to our physiology and improve group fitness.\n    - D: Emotional expressions are a result of cultural influence and social norms.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) (New question) According to the transcript, how did Paul Ekman test the theory of universal emotional expressions?\n    - A: By studying facial expressions in people born blind.\n    - B: By examining film footage of remote tribes isolated from the modern world.\n    - C: By conducting experiments on non-human mammals.\n    - D: By analyzing data from cognitive psychology studies.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) What is one theory about why expressions like sadness signal to the group that something is wrong?\n    - A: It is a learned behavior that varies across cultures.\n    - B: It is an evolutionary adaptation that improves group fitness.\n    - C: It is a result of cultural influence and social norms.\n    - D: It is a physiological response that is not linked to communication.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) (New question) According to the transcript, what is one way that facial expressions can help improve group fitness?\n    - A: By signaling threats to others.\n    - B: By communicating our internal states to those around us.\n    - C: By causing a fight or flight response.\n    - D: By leading to social norms.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n10) According to the transcript, how might the fear expression directly improve survival in potentially dangerous situations?\n    - A: By letting our eyes absorb more light and our lungs take in more air.\n    - B: By signaling to others that we are afraid.\n    - C: By causing our heart rate to increase.\n    - D: By leading to a fight or flight response.\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What has been found in comparisons of facial expressions between humans and non-human mammals?\n    - A: There are no similarities in the structure and movement of facial muscles.\n    - B: There are similarities in the structure and movement of facial muscles.\n    - C: Facial expressions are unique to humans.\n    - D: Facial expressions are only found in primates.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) According to the transcript, what is one way that facial expressions can help improve group fitness?\n    - A: By signaling threats to others.\n    - B: By communicating our internal states to those around us.\n    - C: By causing a fight or flight response.\n    - D: By leading to social norms.\n[Correct answer]: B\n\nNo more refinement needed for questions 1-5 and 8-12. Questions 6, 7, and 9 were added to address gaps in the initial set of questions."
