    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors.\n\nHere are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of thunderstorm is typically associated with the formation of tornadoes?\n    - A: A weak, low-level thunderstorm\n    - B: A powerful, towering thunderstorm called a supercell\n    - C: A thunderstorm with heavy rain and strong winds\n    - D: A thunderstorm with a large amount of hail\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate wind speed range that tornadoes can produce?\n    - A: 30-60 miles per hour\n    - B: 65-110 miles per hour\n    - C: 150-250 miles per hour\n    - D: 300-400 miles per hour\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) What role does condensation play in the formation of a tornado?\n    - A: It creates a rotating wall of cloud that can eventually touch the ground\n    - B: It releases heat, which becomes the energy that drives huge upward drafts of air\n    - C: It forms a rear flank downdraft that wraps around the back of a mesocyclone\n    - D: It creates a temperature difference between the air inside and outside the mesocyclone\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the significance of a mesocyclone in the formation of a tornado?\n    - A: It is a rotating column of air that can extend from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground\n    - B: It forms a rear flank downdraft that wraps around the back of a storm\n    - C: It produces high-force winds and giant hailstones\n    - D: It is a necessary condition for a tornado to form, but not sufficient on its own\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n5) What is the practical application of understanding the conditions that lead to tornado formation?\n    - A: It can help researchers develop new models for predicting tornado formation\n    - B: It can help meteorologists and storm chasers predict when and where tornadoes are likely to occur\n    - C: It can help people take necessary precautions to stay safe during a tornado\n    - D: All of the above\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) Why is it essential to recognize the signs of a tornado?\n    - A: To help researchers develop new models for predicting tornado formation\n    - B: To help meteorologists and storm chasers predict when and where tornadoes are likely to occur\n    - C: To help people take necessary precautions to stay safe during a tornado\n    - D: To understand the underlying causes of tornado formation\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) How do the mesocyclone and the rear flank downdraft interact to create the conditions for a tornado to form?\n    - A: The mesocyclone creates a rear flank downdraft that wraps around the back of a storm\n    - B: The rear flank downdraft creates a temperature difference between the air inside and outside the mesocyclone\n    - C: The mesocyclone and the rear flank downdraft work together to create a rotating wall of cloud\n    - D: The mesocyclone and the rear flank downdraft interact to create a region of instability that can lead to tornado formation\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n8) What is the relationship between the formation of a mesocyclone and the eventual formation of a tornado?\n    - A: The formation of a mesocyclone directly causes the formation of a tornado\n    - B: The formation of a mesocyclone is one of several factors that contribute to the formation of a tornado\n    - C: The formation of a mesocyclone has no effect on the formation of a tornado\n    - D: The formation of a tornado causes the formation of a mesocyclone\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the primary factor that determines whether a mesocyclone will produce a tornado?\n    - A: The strength of the updrafts\n    - B: The presence of a rear flank downdraft\n    - C: The amount of moisture in the air\n    - D: The interaction between the mesocyclone and the ground\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) What is the primary reason why tornadoes eventually dissipate?\n    - A: The temperature difference between the air inside and outside the mesocyclone disappears\n    - B: The moisture in the air dries up\n    - C: The wind speed decreases\n    - D: The storm loses momentum and draws the tornado back inside\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Question 5 was revised to include \"All of the above\" as the correct answer, as understanding the conditions that lead to tornado formation has multiple practical applications.\n- Minor wording changes were made to improve clarity and concision.\n- Distractors were reviewed to ensure they are plausible but incorrect.\n\nNo further refinement is necessary."
