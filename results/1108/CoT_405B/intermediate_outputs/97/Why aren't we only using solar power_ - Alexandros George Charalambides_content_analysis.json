    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**:\n\n1. Solar power is cheaper and more sustainable than traditional power plants.\n2. Traditional power plants use resources like coal, which will eventually run out.\n3. Cloud cover makes solar power unpredictable.\n4. There are three types of irradiance: direct, diffuse, and reflected.\n5. Solar towers use mirrors to focus direct rays onto a single point to generate heat.\n6. Photovoltaics (solar panels) use photons to release electrons and generate an electric current.\n7. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance.\n8. Cumulus clouds can reduce electricity production in solar towers to almost zero.\n9. Mie scattering can increase solar irradiance by more than 50% in solar panels.\n10.
