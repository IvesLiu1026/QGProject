    "refinement_output": "Based on the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I have reviewed and refined the questions. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the approximate ratio of bacterial cells to human cells in the human body?\n    - A: 1:1\n    - B: 5:1\n    - C: 10:1\n    - D: 20:1\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Which type of bacteria is known for its resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics?\n    - A: E. coli\n    - B: MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)\n    - C: Salmonella\n    - D: Lactobacillus\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to Darwin's theory, how do bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics?\n    - A: Through genetic engineering\n    - B: Through random mutations and natural selection\n    - C: Through horizontal gene transfer alone\n    - D: Through vertical gene transfer alone\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) What is the primary concern regarding the overuse of antibiotics in medicine?\n    - A: The development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n    - B: The high cost of antibiotics\n    - C: The side effects of antibiotics\n    - D: The limited availability of antibiotics\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n5) What is the likely outcome of prescribing antibiotics for a viral infection?\n    - A: The patient will recover quickly\n    - B: The patient will experience no effect\n    - C: The patient will develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n    - D: The patient will experience severe side effects\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What are potential alternatives to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections?\n    - A: Vaccines\n    - B: Phage therapy\n    - C: Gene therapy\n    - D: Both A and B\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n7) What is the relationship between the overuse of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria?\n    - A: The overuse of antibiotics leads to a decrease in antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n    - B: The overuse of antibiotics has no effect on the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n    - C: The overuse of antibiotics leads to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n    - D: The relationship is unknown\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) What is the contrast between the short-term benefits and long-term consequences of antibiotic use?\n    - A: Short-term benefits include the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while long-term consequences include the effective treatment of bacterial infections\n    - B: Short-term benefits include the effective treatment of bacterial infections, while long-term consequences include the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n    - C: Short-term benefits include the development of new antibiotics, while long-term consequences include the overuse of antibiotics\n    - D: Short-term benefits include the overuse of antibiotics, while long-term consequences include the development of new antibiotics\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue of antibiotic resistance?\n    - A: Developing new antibiotics\n    - B: Improving public awareness and education\n    - C: Implementing proper hygiene and infection control practices\n    - D: A combination of the above, including reducing unnecessary antibiotic use\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) How can the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance be used to develop new treatments?\n    - A: By targeting the bacterial cell wall alone\n    - B: By interfering with vital processes alone\n    - C: By using a combination of approaches to target bacterial vulnerabilities\n    - D: By developing new antibiotics alone\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n11) What is a critique of the current state of antibiotic development?\n    - A: The development of new antibiotics is too slow\n    - B: The development of new antibiotics is too expensive\n    - C: The development of new antibiotics is not necessary\n    - D: The development of new antibiotics is sufficient to address antibiotic resistance\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n12) What is a justification for the development of new treatments and approaches to addressing antibiotic resistance?\n    - A: The current approaches are effective\n    - B: The current approaches are not effective\n    - C: The development of new treatments is too expensive\n    - D: The development of new treatments is necessary to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor changes to improve clarity and concision, and to ensure that the distractors are plausible but incorrect. I also ensured that the correct answers are accurate. No major changes were necessary, as the initial questions were well-written and aligned with the key concepts in the transcript."
