Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What type of electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?\n    - A: Ultraviolet light\n    - B: Visible light\n    - C: Infrared light\n    - D: X-ray light\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Why is glass transparent to visible light?\n    - A: Its atoms pair well with all energy levels in visible light\n    - B: Its atoms do not pair well with any energy levels in visible light\n    - C: Its atoms absorb all visible light\n    - D: Its atoms reflect all visible light\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n3) According to quantum mechanics, what determines the energy levels of electrons in atoms and molecules?\n    - A: The temperature of the atom or molecule\n    - B: The number of protons in the nucleus\n    - C: The number of possible energy levels for the electrons\n    - D: The speed of the electrons\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n4) What is the relationship between the energy of photons and their color?\n    - A: Higher energy photons correspond to longer wavelengths and red light\n    - B: Higher energy photons correspond to shorter wavelengths and purple light\n    - C: Lower energy photons correspond to shorter wavelengths and purple light\n    - D: Lower energy photons correspond to longer wavelengths and green light\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n5) Why are traditional light bulbs inefficient?\n    - A: They produce too much infrared radiation\n    - B: They produce too little infrared radiation\n    - C: They convert most of their energy to visible light\n    - D: They convert most of their energy to heat rather than visible light\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n6) What is the role of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in climate change?\n    - A: They absorb infrared radiation and cool the Earth's surface\n    - B: They absorb infrared radiation and warm the Earth's surface\n    - C: They reflect infrared radiation and cool the Earth's surface\n    - D: They reflect infrared radiation and warm the Earth's surface\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n7) What happens to the energy absorbed by carbon dioxide molecules when they absorb infrared photons?\n    - A: The energy is lost to space\n    - B: The energy is stored in the molecule\n    - C: The energy is re-emitted in a random direction\n    - D: The energy is converted to visible light\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n8) How does the energy efficiency of traditional light bulbs compare to the natural process of thermal radiation?\n    - A: Traditional light bulbs are more energy-efficient than thermal radiation\n    - B: Traditional light bulbs are less energy-efficient than thermal radiation\n    - C: Traditional light bulbs and thermal radiation have the same energy efficiency\n    - D: The energy efficiency of traditional light bulbs and thermal radiation cannot be compared\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) What is the relationship between human perception and the concept of \"visible light\"?\n    - A: Human perception is the only factor that determines what is considered visible light\n    - B: Human perception is one of many factors that determines what is considered visible light\n    - C: Human perception has no effect on what is considered visible light\n    - D: The concept of visible light is limited by human perception, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation are equally important\n[Correct answer]: D\n\n10) How can the principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels be applied to various phenomena?\n    - A: The principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels can only be applied to atomic and molecular phenomena\n    - B: The principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels can be applied to various phenomena, including global warming and thermal radiation\n    - C: The principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels have no relevance to global warming and thermal radiation\n    - D: The principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels can only be applied to macroscopic phenomena\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n11) What is the potential consequence of increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere?\n    - A: A decrease in the Earth's temperature\n    - B: An increase in the Earth's temperature\n    - C: No effect on the Earth's temperature\n    - D: A decrease in the amount of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n12) Why is it important to understand the principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels?\n    - A: It is not important to understand the principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels\n    - B: Understanding the principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels can help us develop more energy-efficient technologies\n    - C: Understanding the principles of quantum mechanics and energy levels can help us better understand the natural world\n    - D: Both B and C are correct\n[Correct answer]: D\n\nI made minor changes to questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 to improve clarity and concision. I also rephrased question 7 to better assess the understanding of the energy absorption and re-emission process. No major changes were necessary, and the questions are now refined and ready for use."
