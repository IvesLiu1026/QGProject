Repetition is a feature that music from cultures around the world tends to share.\n3. The Muppets classic \"Mahna Mahna\" is an example of a song that uses repetition effectively.\n4. Recent studies have shown that when people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move or tap along to it.\n5. Semantic satiation is a phenomenon where repeating a word can make you stop thinking about its meaning and focus on its sounds.\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n1. Music relies heavily on repetition because it takes advantage of the mere-exposure effect, making people more likely to enjoy and remember it.\n2. Repetition in music creates a sense of anticipation and expectation, making listeners imagine what's coming next.\n3. Repetition invites listeners to participate in music, rather than just passively listening to it.\n4. Research has shown that listeners shift their attention across musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of the sound on each new listen.\n\n**Application**\n\n1. Advertisers can use the mere-exposure effect to make their ads more memorable and effective by repeating them multiple times.\n2. Musicians can use repetition to create catchy and memorable songs that stick in people's heads.\n3. Music therapists can use repetition to help patients with memory or cognitive impairments.\n4.

The use of repetition in music can be combined with other musical elements, such as melody and harmony, to create a rich and complex sound.\n3.

The concept of repetition in music can be applied to other art forms, such as dance or visual art, to create new and innovative works.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. Critics who dismiss music as childish or regressive because of its repetition are missing the point of how repetition functions in music.\n2. The use of repetition in music can be justified as a deliberate artistic choice, rather than a lack of creativity or originality.\n3. The impact of repetition on listeners' attention and engagement can be evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in creating a memorable and enjoyable musical experience.\n4.
