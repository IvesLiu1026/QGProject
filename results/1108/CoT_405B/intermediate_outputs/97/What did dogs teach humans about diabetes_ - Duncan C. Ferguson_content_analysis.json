    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**:\n\n1. 400,000,000 people worldwide suffer from diabetes mellitus.\n2. The disease was recognized as far back as 1500 BCE in Egypt.\n3. The term \"diabetes\" was first used in 250 BCE by the Greek physician Apollonius of Memphis.\n4. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions by Indian physicians in the 5th century CE.\n5. Removing a dog's pancreas causes it to develop all the signs of diabetes.\n6. Frederick Banting and Charles Best confirmed the pancreas' role in regulating blood glucose in 1920.\n7. The first human patient was treated with insulin in 1922.\n8. Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1923.\n9. Dogs develop diabetes at a rate of two cases per 1,000 dogs.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**:\n\n1. The early symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst and large volumes of urine.\n2. The disease was known but its causes were unknown until the early 20th century.\n3. The discovery of insulin was made possible by experiments on dogs.\n4. Insulin is used to treat diabetes in both humans and dogs.\n5. The process of developing insulin involved the work of multiple researchers, including Von Mering, Minkowski, Banting, Best, and Collip.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**:\n\n1. Using insulin to treat diabetes in dogs.\n2. Managing a dog's diabetes with insulin injections, regimented feedings, and periodic blood measurements.\n3. Using purified pig insulin or human insulin to treat diabetes in dogs.\n4. Applying the knowledge gained from animal research to human medicine.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**:\n\n1. The relationship between the pancreas and diabetes.\n2. The contrast between the understanding of diabetes in ancient times and the discovery of insulin in the 20th century.\n3. The cause-and-effect connection between the removal of a dog's pancreas and the development of diabetes.\n4. The similarity between Type 1 diabetes in humans and dogs.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**:\n\n1. The discovery of insulin was a result of the combination of research by multiple scientists and the use of animal models.\n2. The knowledge gained from animal research can be applied to human medicine and vice versa.\n3. The management of diabetes in dogs can inform the management of diabetes in humans.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**:\n\n1. The ethics of using animals in medical research.\n2. The justification for using insulin to treat diabetes in dogs.\n3. The critique of the pharmaceutical industry's role in developing and manufacturing insulin.\n4. The judgment of the impact of the discovery of insulin on human lives and the treatment of diabetes."
