A: A rotating column of air that forms inside storms\n    - B: A powerful, towering thunderstorm that can reach up to 50,000 feet\n    - C: A wide, tall tube of spinning air that forms inside a storm\n    - D: A type of cloud that produces heavy rain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the approximate wind speed range that tornadoes can produce?\n    - A: 30-60 miles per hour\n    - B: 65-110 miles per hour\n    -

B: It releases heat, which becomes the energy that drives huge upward drafts of air\n    - C: It forms a rotating wall of cloud that can eventually touch the ground\n    - D: It creates a rear flank downdraft that wraps around the back of a mesocyclone\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the significance of a mesocyclone in the formation of a tornado?\n    - A: It creates a area of rotating air that can eventually touch the ground\n    - B: It forms a rear flank downdraft that wraps around the back of a storm\n    - C: It produces high-force winds and giant hailstones\n    - D: It creates a temperature difference between the air inside and outside a storm\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n**Application**\n\n1) What is the practical application of understanding the conditions that lead to tornado formation?\n    - A: It can help researchers develop new models for predicting tornado formation\n    - B: It can help meteorologists and storm chasers predict when and where tornadoes are likely to occur\n    - C: It can help people take necessary precautions to stay safe during a tornado\n    - D: It can help researchers develop more effective strategies for mitigating the effects of tornadoes on communities\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the importance of recognizing the signs of a tornado?\n    - A: It can help researchers develop new models for predicting tornado formation\n    - B: It can help meteorologists and storm chasers predict when and where tornadoes are likely to occur\n    - C: It can help people take necessary precautions to stay safe during a tornado\n    - D: It can help researchers develop more effective strategies for mitigating the effects of tornadoes on communities\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1) What is the relationship between the mesocyclone and the rear flank downdraft in creating the conditions for a tornado to form?\n    - A: The mesocyclone creates a rear flank downdraft that wraps around the back of a storm\n    - B: The rear flank downdraft creates a temperature difference between the air inside and outside the mesocyclone\n    - C: The mesocyclone and the rear flank downdraft work together to create a rotating wall of cloud\n    - D: The mesocyclone and the rear flank downdraft are two separate entities that do not interact with each other\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n2) What is the cause-and-effect connection between the formation of a mesocyclone and the eventual formation of a tornado?\n    - A: The formation of a mesocyclone directly causes the formation of a tornado\n    - B: The formation of a mesocyclone is one of several factors that contribute to the formation of a tornado\n    - C: The formation of a mesocyclone has no effect on the formation of a tornado\n    - D: The formation of a tornado causes the formation of a mesocyclone\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n1) What is the potential benefit of combining knowledge of atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and moisture levels in predicting tornado formation?\n    -
