    "content_analysis": "**Knowledge (Recall)**\n\n1. Michelangelo's Statue of David was originally intended to be placed atop the grand cathedral in Florence.\n2. The statue is 17 feet tall and made of pure white marble.\n3. The statue was finished in 1504.\n4. The original plan included 11 other statues of Old Testament heroes.\n5. The statue was eventually placed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria.\n6. The Medici family was exiled from Florence.\n7. The original statue was moved to the Galleria dell'Accademia in 1873.\n8. A replica of David still appears at the Palazzo della Signoria.\n\n**Comprehension (Understanding)**\n\n1. The context in which an artwork is displayed can significantly impact its meaning and interpretation.\n2. Michelangelo's Statue of David was intended to convey a powerful religious message when placed atop the cathedral.\n3. The statue's placement in front of the Palazzo della Signoria transformed its meaning to a symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds.\n4. The statue's significance changed from religious to political when placed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria.\n5. The museum setting allows for a detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill.\n\n**Application (Real-world scenarios)**\n\n1. How might the meaning of a contemporary artwork change if it were displayed in a different location, such as a public park versus a museum?\n2. Consider how the context of a historical event or cultural movement might influence the interpretation of an artwork created during that time.\n3. Think about how the placement of a monument or public art installation might impact its message or significance.\n\n**Analysis (Relationships, contrasts, cause-and-effect)**\n\n1. Compare and contrast the intended meaning of Michelangelo's Statue of David in its original context versus its eventual placement in front of the Palazzo della Signoria.\n2. Analyze how the statue's significance changed over time, from a religious to a political symbol, and finally to a focus on artistic and technical skill in the museum setting.\n3. Consider the cause-and-effect relationship between the Medici family's exile and the statue's new placement and meaning.\n4. Examine the relationship between the statue's design (e.g., David's disproportionately large head and hand) and its intended viewing angle.\n\n**Synthesis (Combining ideas)**\n\n1. How might the concept of context influencing an artwork's meaning be applied to other art forms, such as literature or music?\n2. Consider how the intersection of art, politics, and culture might impact the interpretation of an artwork.\n3. Think about how the idea of an artwork's meaning changing over time might be applied to contemporary art practices.\n\n**Evaluation (Judgment, critique, justification)**\n\n1. Do you think the statue's meaning was improved or diminished by its placement in front of the Palazzo della Signoria? Justify your answer.\n2. Evaluate the impact of the museum setting on the interpretation of Michelangelo's Statue of David. Do you think this setting enhances or detracts from the artwork's significance?\n3. Consider the role of the artist's intentions versus the viewer's interpretation in determining an artwork's meaning. Which do you think is more important, and why?"
