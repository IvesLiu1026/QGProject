    "refinement_output": "After reviewing the transcript, initial set of questions, and prior feedback, I refined the questions to ensure they align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors. Here are the refined questions:\n\n1) What is the primary external source of energy for Earth?\n    - A: Geothermal energy\n    - B: Fossil fuels\n    - C: The Sun\n    - D: Radioactive isotopes\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n2) Approximately what percentage of energy is passed on to the next level in a food chain?\n    - A: 50%\n    - B: 20%\n    - C: 10%\n    - D: 5%\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n3) What happens to some of the energy during energy transfer in Earth's physical systems?\n    - A: It is gained from the surroundings\n    - B: It is lost to the surroundings as heat, light, or sound\n    - C: It is stored in the form of carbon\n    - D: It is transferred to the next level in a food chain\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n4) At what level in a food chain do animals obtain energy most efficiently?\n    - A: Eating decomposers\n    - B: Eating consumers\n    - C: Eating producers\n    - D: Eating other animals\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n5) Why is understanding energy flow in ecosystems crucial?\n    - A: To develop new technologies\n    - B: To make informed decisions about resource management and conservation\n    - C: To study the behavior of animals\n    - D: To learn about the water cycle\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n6) What is a potential benefit of improving energy efficiency?\n    - A: Increased greenhouse gas emissions\n    - B: Decreased socioeconomic status\n    - C: Improved health, education, and socioeconomic status\n    - D: Reduced renewable energy sources\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n7) What is the relationship between energy transfer and loss in Earth's physical systems?\n    - A: Energy is gained during transfer\n    - B: Energy is lost during transfer as heat, light, or sound\n    - C: Energy is stored during transfer\n    - D: Energy is transferred without loss\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n8) How does the Sun's energy influence weather and climate patterns?\n    - A: The Sun's energy has no effect on weather and climate patterns\n    - B: The Sun's energy drives weather and climate patterns\n    - C: Weather and climate patterns drive the Sun's energy\n    - D: The Sun's energy is not related to weather and climate patterns\n[Correct answer]: B\n\n9) How can knowledge of energy flow in ecosystems inform human energy needs?\n    - A: By developing new technologies\n    - B: By studying the behavior of animals\n    - C: By developing sustainable energy solutions\n    - D: By learning about the water cycle\n[Correct answer]: C\n\n10) What can be achieved by integrating information about renewable energy sources?\n    - A: A comprehensive energy plan\n    - B: A new technology\n    - C: A study on animal behavior\n    - D: A decrease in socioeconomic status\n[Correct answer]: A\n\n11) What is a key criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of different energy sources?\n    - A: Their environmental impact\n    - B: Their cost\n    - C: Their ability to meet global energy demands\n    - D: Their availability and sustainability\n[Correct answer]: D (Refined to include sustainability)\n\n12) Why is investing in renewable energy sources important?\n    - A: To decrease socioeconomic status\n    - B: To increase greenhouse gas emissions\n    - C: To reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change\n    - D: To develop new technologies\n[Correct answer]: C (Refined to include mitigating climate change)\n\nThese refined questions align with the key concepts in the transcript, are clear and concise, and have plausible but incorrect distractors."
